5,5,Invariant information clustering for unsupervised image classification and segmentation,"We present a novel clustering objective that learns a neural network classifier from scratch, given only unlabelled data samples. The model discovers clusters that accurately match semantic classes, achieving state-of-the-art results in eight unsupervised clustering benchmarks spanning image classification and segmentation. These include STL10, an unsupervised variant of ImageNet, and CIFAR10, where we significantly beat the accuracy of our closest competitors by 6.6 and 9.5 absolute percentage points respectively. The method is not specialised to computer vision and operates on any paired dataset samples; in our experiments we use random transforms to obtain a pair from each image. The trained network directly outputs semantic labels, rather than high dimensional representations that need external processing to be usable for semantic clustering. The objective is simply to maximise mutual information between the class assignments of each pair. It is easy to implement and rigorously grounded in information theory, meaning we effortlessly avoid degenerate solutions that other clustering methods are susceptible to. In addition to the fully unsupervised mode, we also test two semi-supervised settings. The first achieves 88.8% accuracy on STL10 classification, setting a new global state-of-the-art over all existing methods (whether supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised). The second shows robustness to 90% reductions in label coverage, of relevance to applications that wish to make use of small amounts of labels. github.com/xu-ji/IIC.",60026851,University of Oxford,Oxford,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707']",19.90909090909091,0.05898484848484849,0.40008441558441554,1

30,30,Lightweight method for detecting fake authentication attack on Wi-Fi," All rights reserved.Wireless networks, despite providing better access and flexibility, have vulnerabilities that are easier to realize compared to wired networks. Fake authentication attack can be taken by an attacker prior to carrying out a Man in the Middle attack to intercept the other party's communication. Such an attack is generally carried out in public places that provide free Wi-Fi access. Detection of fake authentication is necessary to maintain communication success. Several methods have been applied to detect fake authentication such as the use of Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) or certificates on Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, attackers can trick the use of WIDS or TLS. Moreover, the WIDS and TLS techniques require large costs and computations. In this study, a lightweight method based on the comparison of BSSID/MAC address for detecting fake authentication is proposed. The lightweight method is implemented by creating an application that runs on Android mobile phones, and Linux operating system. We compared the detection performance of the device with the proposed application and the one without the proposed application.

50,50,Applying MAC address-based access control for securing admin’s login page," All rights reserved.Authentication is a very important process for securing web applications. Username and password are two parameters commonly used for user authentication on the administrator’s login page. However, such the two authentication parameters can be easily breached so that they can become a vulnerability that adversary parties can use to conduct malicious activities. For example, the attackers can commit a crime such as data modification or theft or even more dangerous take over administrator services of a system. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the security mechanism by adding additional factor of authentication other than username and password. In this study, an improvement in authentication mechanisms was carried out by applying MAC Address-based access control as an additional authentication factor. In this method, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used in mapping the users Internet Protocol (IP) address to their MAC address during validation process.

In certain locations, Netflix streams video over TCP New Reno from racks of servers that are directly connected to large routers, which in turn directly peer with commercial ISPs. We vary the size of the router buffers during periods of persistent congestion, and log metrics such as the number of rebuffering events, video quality, and video play delay. We observe buffers that are too small and too large, both of which worsen video QoE. Our results are for a specific, but we believe interesting, case: a router carrying large numbers of long-lived TCP flows, shedding light on how buffers should be sized by CDNs and video content providers. We find that the generality of our results is limited by the specific internal workings of the VOQ-based chassis routers used in our experiments, which have a different buffer architecture than prior work.

The suggested AGNN recasts this task as a process of iterative information fusion over video graphs. Specifically, AGNN builds a fully connected graph to efficiently represent frames as nodes, and relations between arbitrary frame pairs as edges. The underlying pair-wise relations are described by a differentiable attention mechanism. Through parametric message passing, AGNN is able to efficiently capture and mine much richer and higher-order relations between video frames, thus enabling a more complete understanding of video content and more accurate foreground estimation. Experimental results on three video segmentation datasets show that AGNN sets a new state-of-the-art in each case. To further demonstrate the generalizability of our framework, we extend AGNN to an additional task: Image object co-segmentation (IOCS). We perform experiments on two famous IOCS datasets and observe again the superiority of our AGNN model. The extensive experiments verify that AGNN is able to learn the underlying semantic/appearance relationships among video frames or related images, and discover the common objects.",60021121,Indiana University Bloomington,Bloomington,United States,"['1712', '1707']",19.555555555555557,0.21477272727272728,0.5357007575757575,1

56,56,Towards heterogeneous multi-scale computing on large scale parallel supercomputers,"New applications that can exploit emerging exascale computing resources efficiently, while providing meaningful scientific results, are eagerly anticipated. Multi-scale models, especially multi-scale applications, will assuredly run at the exascale. We have established that a class of multi-scale applications implementing the heterogeneous multi-scale model follows, a heterogeneous multi-scale computing (HMC) pattern, which typically features a macroscopic model synchronising numerous independent microscopic model simulations. Consequently, communication between microscopic simulations is limited. Furthermore, a surrogate model can often be introduced between macro-scale and micro-scale models to interpolate required data from previously computed micro-scale simulations, thereby substantially reducing the number of micro-scale simulations. Nonetheless, HMC applications, though versatile, remain constrained by load balancing issues. We discuss two main issues: the a priori unknown and variable execution time of microscopic simulations, and the dynamic number of micro-scale simulations required. We tackle execution time variability using a pilot job mechanism to handle internal queuing and multiple sub-model execution on large-scale supercomputers, together with a data-informed execution time prediction model. To dynamically select the number of micro-scale simulations, the HMC pattern automatically detects and identifies three surrogate model phases that help control the available and used core amount. After relevant phase detection and micro-scale simulation scheduling, any idle cores can be used for surrogate model update or for processor release back to the system. We demonstrate HMC performance by testing it on two representative multi-scale applications. We conclude that, considering the subtle interplay between the macroscale model, surrogate models and micro-scale simulations, HMC provides a promising path towards exascale for many multiscale applications.",60033126,King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology,Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,"['1712', '1710', '1708', '1706', '1705', '1703']",21.333333333333332,0.07710184552289816,0.38363522442469816,1

In this paper, we studied the marine debris pollution on the seafloor of the North and Central Moroccan Atlantic waters from Tangier (35° N) to Sidi Ifni(29° N). The data were collected during two scientific trawling surveys conducted aboard the Charif Elidrissi Vessel in February-March 2015 and March 2018.

Our assumption is that all organizations, evolve to higher complex levels, whereby at some point ""organizational autonomous life"" emerges as a reification, at a macro systemic level, of the social-technical network of its autonomous agents. This reification is precisely realized by the emergence of the EOS, enabling the enterpise closure, characterized by its completeness and self-reference, and the preservation of its wholeness and distinctiveness.

61,61,Improved MEET-in-the-middle preimage attacks against AES hashing modes," All rights reserved.Hashing modes are ways to convert a block cipher into a hash function, and those with AES as the underlying block cipher are referred to as AES hashing modes. Sasaki in 2011, introduced the first preimage attack against AES hashing modes with the AES block cipher reduced to 7 rounds, by the method of meet-in-the-middle. In his attack, the key-schedules are not taken into account. Hence, the same attack applies to all three versions of AES. In this paper, by introducing neutral bits from the key, extra degree of freedom is gained, which is utilized in two ways, i.e., to reduce the time complexity and to extend the attack to more rounds. As an immediate result, the complexities of 7-round pseudo-preimage attacks are reduced from 2120 to 2104, 296, and 296 for AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256, respectively. By carefully choosing the neutral bits from the key to cancel those from the state, the attack is extended to 8 rounds for AES-192 and AES-256 with complexities 2112 and 296 . Similar results are obtained for Kiasu-BC, a tweakable block cipher based on AES-128, and interestingly the additional input tweak helps reduce the complexity and extend the attack to one more round. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first preimage attacks against 8-round AES hashing modes.",60095095,School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1706']",24.444444444444443,0.2076923076923077,0.4993589743589744,0

Environments such as pervasive classrooms or smart offices provide diverse services and connect a variety of heterogeneous and mostly mobile devices. Besides all the advantages of this seamless communication, it is a complex task to control the information flow within these environments. As an example, the information flow could control that students in a classroom are allowed to share their screen on a projector or the lecturers laptop. For that, we propose PerFlow, a middleware that allows to configure the information flow within a pervasive environment at runtime. The middleware is designed to enable technically unskilled personnel, such as a lecturer in a classroom might be, to define rules about who is able to send what to whom. Therefore, we have implemented a visual scripting tool into PerFlow. Our evaluation shows that PerFlow enforces the information flow within a pervasive environment without noticeable overhead.

63,63,Multi-destination vehicular route planning with parking and traffic constraints,"This paper aims to provide an efficient solution for people in a city who drive their cars to visit several destinations, where they need to park for a while, but do not care about the visiting order. This instance of the multi-destination route planning problem is novel in terms of its constraints: the real-time traffic conditions and the real-time free parking conditions in the city. The paper proposes a novel Multi-Destination Vehicle Route Planning (MDVRP) system to optimize the travel time for all drivers. MDVRP's design has two components: a mobile app running on the drivers' smart phones that submits real-time route requests and guides the drivers toward destinations, and a server in the cloud that optimizes the routes by finding the most efficient order to visit the destinations. MDVRP uses TDTSP-FPA, an algorithm that finds the fastest route to the next destination and also assigns free curbside parking spaces that minimize the total travel time for drivers. We evaluate MDVRP using a driver trip dataset that contains real vehicular mobility traces of over two million drivers from the city of Cologne, Germany. By learning the spatio-temporal distribution of real driver destinations from this dataset, we build a novel experimental platform that simulates real, multi-destination driver trips. Extensive simulations executed over this platform demonstrate that TDTSP-FPA delivers the best performance when compared to three baseline algorithms.",60022904,New Jersey Institute of Technology,Newark,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",28.25,0.24725274725274726,0.41739926739926736,1

Against the backdrop of this grand societal challenge, it is necessary to explore approaches that envision a paradigm shift in how material is sourced, processed and assembled to address the magnitude of these challenges in a truly sustainable way, and which can even provide added value.

65,65,Efficient content caching for named data network nodes,"Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising Content-Centric Network (CCN) architecture that supports data distribution and data sharing by in-network ubiquitous content caching. In NDN, each router has content store to cache data packets passed by and, therefore, frequently requested content by consumers (e.g., end hosts) is cached at multiple routers in the network. Content caching at routers enables data delivery to consumers from a nearest location with minimal latency and thereby enhances overall network performance. Content store at nodes should have sufficient space to hold the current frame of locality of reference for attaining a good hit rate. The content store size requirement for each node is different due to their topological characteristics. Homogeneous caching mechanisms distribute the total cache budget equally among the nodes irrespective of their topological characteristics. In contrast, heterogeneous caching allocates cache to the nodes based on their topological importance. In this paper, a heterogeneous on-path cache budget distribution approach is proposed that distributes cache to the content stores based on reference locality of the nodes. The proposed cache distribution algorithm is evaluated for structured and unstructured network topology using the ndnSIM simulator. The results are compared with the homogeneous cache distribution mechanism and 14% improvement in cache hit rate is achieved.",60000414,"Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani",Pilani,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",20.7,0.07045454545454545,0.3977272727272727,1

67,67,A scheme for anomalous RFID trajectory detection based on improved clustering algorithm under digital-twin-driven,"Anomaly analysis of trajectories is one of the means to maintain indoor safety. Effective track anomaly detection should be based on the current road network structure. However, the indoor environment usually contains many obstacles flexible to move. The changes in the positions of obstacles frequently cause the changes of the road network structure. When the road network changes, it takes time and effort to manually redraw the road network and simultaneously losses the guarantee of real-time performance. At the same time, manual drawing is forbidden in some confidential places. In our paper, the scheme of RFID track anomaly detection combined with digital-twin technology is proposed to provide a real-time actual road network for anomaly analysis. The accurate mapping and virtual simulation functions of digital-twin technology are used to achieve the dynamic real-time rendering and the maintenance of the indoor road network structure. We also improve a clustering algorithm to make it suitable for indoor RFID track clustering. In our paper, deviation thresholds and digital-twin model are used to detect anomalies. The trajectory is judged to be abnormal when it appears in the restricted areas or exceeds the deviation thresholds in any terms of position, velocity, or direction.

Different from generic object detection, scene text detection mainly suffers from the large variance of scale, aspect ratio, and orientation in scene text. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient model (SEG-FPN) for scene text detection, which is based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Linking Segments (SegLink). We incorporate feature pyramid mechanism with Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework to deal with different scale texts, and link locally detectable elements to detect texts of different orientations and aspect ratios. Moreover, compared with SSD, we enlarge the feature map of deep layers to better localize the large texts and recognize the small texts accurately. Experiments on ICDAR2015 and ICDAR2013 datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve comparable performance in terms of both accuracy and time. Specifically, SEG-FPN achieves an f-measure of 0.820 at 10.3 fps for 1280∗768 ICDAR 2015 Incidental text images, and an f-measure of 0.879 at 19.2 fps for 512∗512 ICDAR 2013 focused scene text images.",120356693,Meituan-Dianping Group,Beijing,China,['1707'],25.285714285714285,0.1651260504201681,0.5032212885154062,1
70,70,Pattern of e-marketplace customer shopping behavior using improved tabu search and FP-growth algorithm," All rights reserved.Pattern of customer shopping behavior can be known by analyzing market cart. This analysis is performed using Association Rule Mining (ARM) method in order to improve cross-sale. The weakness of ARM is if processed data is big data, it takes more time to process the data. To optimize the ARM, we perform merging algorithm with Improved Tabu Search (TS). The application of Improved TS algorithm as optimization algorithm for preprocessing datasets, data filtering, and sorting data closely related products on sales data can optimize the ARM processing. The method of Association Rule Mining (FP-Growth) to determine frequent K-itemset, Support value and Confidence value of data which is already sorted on TS is based on patterns which often appear in the dataset so it generates rules as reference of decision making for company. To measure the level of power of rule which has been formed, the Lift Ratio value was calculated. Based on the calculation of 97 rules produced, the lift ratio produces values > 1 of 82.54% and based on processing time, it produces the fastest data search in 1.66 seconds. When compared with previous research that uses the hybrid method, for data retrieval based on processing time, it produces the fastest data search within 12.3406 seconds, 150 seconds and 50 seconds. Previous studies have only compared the processing time of data searching without regard to validation/accuracy of data search. The test results in this study obtained more optimal results than when compared with the results of previous studies, namely in time efficiency and data mining in real time and more accurate data validation.

However, the occurrence of some scripts is rare as compared to others. Due to the availability of a few samples of the rare script, the supervised learning of the deep neural networks is difficult. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a zero-shot learning based method for script identification. We have also proposed architecture for script identification which fuses the global feature vector and the semantic embedding vector. The semantic embedding of the script is obtained by using the spatial dependency of the stroke's sequence via the recurrent neural network.

72,72,Hybrid training data for historical text OCR,"Current optical character recognition (OCR) systems commonly make use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) that process whole text lines. Such systems avoid the task of character segmentation necessary for character-based approaches. A disadvantage of this approach is a need of a large amount of annotated data. This can be solved by sing generated synthetic data instead of costly manually annotated ones. Unfortunately, such data is often not suitable for historical documents particularly for quality reasons. This work presents a hybrid approach for generating annotated data for OCR at a low cost. We first collect a small dataset of isolated characters from historical document images. Then, we generate historical looking text lines from the generated characters. Another contribution lies in the design and implementation of an OCR system based on a convolutional-LSTM network. We first pre-train this system on hybrid data. Afterwards, the network is fine-tuned with real printed text lines. We demonstrate that this training strategy is efficient for obtaining state-of-the-art results.

Drawn responses by subjects are mostly characterized by high degree of deformations that indicates presence of various visual, perceptual and motor disorders. Classification of deformations is a challenging task due to complex and extensive rule representation. In this study, we propose a novel technique to model clinical manifestations using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). Drawn responses of nine templates used for assessment of perceptual orientation of individuals are employed as training samples. A number of defined deviations scored in each template are then modeled by applying fine tuning on a pre-trained DCNN architecture. Performance of the proposed technique is evaluated on samples of 106 children. Results of experiments show that pre-trained DCNNs can model and classify a number of deformations across multiple shapes with considerable success. Nevertheless some deformations are represented more reliably than the others. Overall promising classification results are observed that substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed technique.",60070613,Bahria University,Islamabad,Pakistan,['1707'],17.0,0.1677450980392157,0.4057843137254902,1

75,75,Product Line Configuration Meets Process Mining," Published by Elsevier B.V.Product line engineering is a new production paradigm that provides organizations a competitive edge by improving productivity and decreasing costs. The purpose with this new production paradigm is no longer to develop a single product but to develop a product family and to generate the products of the line through configuration processes. However, the potential benefits of product line engineering can be missed when dealing with large product lines because the configuration processes become error prone tasks. Consequently, guiding stakeholders during such complex configuration processes and recommending the best configuration alternatives until leading to a satisfying experience becomes a challenge. This paper focuses on enhancing product line configuration processes through process mining techniques. Therefore, user's actions of previous product line configurations are logged, mined and analyzed. We conducted a preliminary research to motivate the advantages of process mining in product line configuration and to explore what can process mining bring for configuration processes and how to use it to enhance configuration processes. Thus, guidance questions are sketched in order to position process mining as a solving tool for the configuration difficulties. Furthermore, we propose a reference architecture that considers process mining for configuring product lines.",60105670,"Laboratoire des Sciences et Techniques de l'Information, de la Communication et de la Connaissance (Lab-Sticc)",Brest,France,['1700'],22.11111111111111,0.14489177489177488,0.4918614718614719,0

In this paper, we propose a method to groups text lines into semantic objects. We model a page as a graph where nodes represent text lines and the edges their geometric relations. The logical segmentation task then refers to identify all text lines belonging to some logical sub-division of the page. We model this task as categorizing edges as relevant or not to build the targeted sub-division (sub-graph). This edge categorization is performed using structured machine learning algorithms (graph Conditional Random Field and Edge Convolutional Network). We use a connected components-based approach following the edge classification for aggregating the nodes. This simple approach shows very robust results for various layout and various page sub-division. We experiment on table segmentation into multiple sub-divisions (rows, columns, and cells) and minutes segmentation into resolutions. Our sub-division and page-layout oblivious approach shows near-par performance as compared to task dedicated approaches and even outperforms them in certain setups.",60121135,Naver Labs Corporation,Seongnam,South Korea,['1707'],17.0,0.06790352504638218,0.42379406307977735,1
77,77,Sub-word embeddings for OCR corrections in highly fusional indic languages,"Texts in Indic Languages contain a large proportion of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words due to frequent fusion using conjoining rules (of which there are around 4000 in Sanskrit). OCR errors further accentuate this complexity for the error correction systems. Variations of sub-word units such as n-grams, possibly encapsulating the context, can be extracted from the OCR text as well as the language text individually. Some of the sub-word units that are derived from the texts in such languages highly correlate to the word conjoining rules. Signals such as frequency values (on a corpus) associated with such sub-word units have been used previously with log-linear classifiers for detecting errors in Indic OCR texts. We explore two different encodings to capture such signals and augment the input to Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based OCR correction models, that have proven useful in the past for jointly learning the language as well as OCR-specific confusions. The first type of encoding makes direct use of sub-word unit frequency values, derived from the training data. The formulation results in faster convergence and better accuracy values of the error correction model on four different languages with varying complexities. The second type of encoding makes use of trainable sub-word embeddings. We introduce a new procedure for training fastText embeddings on the sub-word units and further observe a large gain in F-Scores, as well as word-level accuracy values.",60122610,IITB-Monash Research Academy,Mumbai,India,['1707'],22.9,0.0532026307026307,0.42218031968031966,1

They are used to aggregate activations of spatial locations to produce a fixed-size vector in several state-of-the-art CNNs. Global average pooling or global max pooling are commonly used for converting convolutional features of variable size images to a fix-sized embedding. However, both pooling layer types are computed spatially independent: each individual activation map is pooled and thus activations of different locations are pooled together. In contrast, we propose Deep Generalized Max Pooling that balances the contribution of all activations of a spatially coherent region by re-weighting all descriptors so that the impact of frequent and rare ones is equalized. We show that this layer is superior to both average and max pooling on the classification of Latin medieval manuscripts (CLAMM'16, CLAMM'17), as well as writer identification (Historical-WI'17).",60003263,University of West Bohemia,Plzen,Czech Republic,['1707'],23.166666666666668,0.0588235294117647,0.3485294117647059,1

94,94,Learning 2D morphological network for old document image binarization,"Document image binarization, especially old handwritten documents, is a very important yet challenging task. There are various bottlenecks for binarizing historical documents due to different types of degradation present imultaneously such as back impression, ink bleed through, faded colours, and wear and tear of the writing media. We consider these degradation as various types of noise in the document image. Here we have proposed a 2D morphological network which consists of basic morphological operation like dilation and erosion to perform our targeted task. The network also includes linear combination of output from dilation and erosion operations. The aforementioned 2D morphological network is applied for image binarization, where the structuring elements (SEs) and the weights of the linear combination layer are learned through back-propagation. The proposed network has been evaluated on DIBCO 2017 and H-DIBCO 2018 and ISI-Letter dataset. Our results show more convincing as compared to the results of other state-of-the-art methods. Though the network is developed for old handwritten documents, it may be tuned to work for image processing task.

Current word spotting approaches are designed to work on a single language and/or script. Building intelligent models that learn script-independent multilingual word-spotting is challenging due to the large variability of multilingual alphabets and symbols.

ACM ISBN 978-1-4503-7745-4/19/12...$15.00Buffer sizing is a tricky task - it depends on a large number of variables, ranging from congestion control to traffic engineering. Still, the most unpredictable contributors are the workloads running in the network. The link utilization and burstiness of these workloads dictate the buffer depth needed by a switch. But what is a burst? Do traditional definitions still apply in the age in which switches transfer terabits of data and billions of packets every second? Unless we assess bursts correctly, we are unlikely to size buffers appropriately. In this work, we present a measurement-led evaluation of the burstiness of different data center applications. We address the question of “what is a burst?” and assert that common techniques cannot answer this question in modern data centers. We quantify the change in burstiness of the studied applications across multiple vectors, including latency and network perspective, and generalize our results to the common case. Our observations can inform future buffer sizing efforts and guide switch configurations.

98,98,A new parallel detection-recognition approach for end-to-end scene text extraction,"In this work, we present a new conceptually simple and flexible network for accurate scene text extraction, which handle text detection and text recognition concurrently. Apart from solving feature sharing by designing a unified network, we implement end-to-end training of the whole system by a set of new optimization strategies. More importantly, this method highlights its novel parallel detection-recognition structure, which constructs a loose connection between both detection and recognition. This loose connection is embodied in the definition of overall loss and derivative back propagation for the model parameter updating, which automatically balances the contribution of the two branches to the system performance. It is different from the existing end-to-end methods where two subtasks are connected serially and thus yielding heavy dependence of the predecessor text detection task on the follow-up text recognition task and sensitivity of recognition to detection noise. In addition, a simple Mask-Rectifier mechanism is applied to easily adapt our system to incidental text recognition with arbitrary orientation and shape.

It is also included in the 4G LTE standard. In this paper we derive vectorized linear approximations of the finite state machine in SNOW 3G. In particular, we show one 24-bit approximation with a bias around 2−37 and one byte-oriented approximation with a bias around 2−40. We then use the approximations to launch attacks on SNOW 3G. The first approximation is used in a distinguishing attack resulting in an expected complexity of 2172 and the second one can be used in a standard fast correlation attack resulting in key recovery in an expected complexity of 2177.

102,102,Constructing 3D maps for dynamic environments using autonomous UAVs,"This paper presents the design and implementation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which can navigate autonomously in dynamic environments. The goal of the project is to minimize the risks to workers' safety by deploying UAVs to inaccessible places which are frequently found in the Oil & Gas Industry such as confined pipelines. The autonomous UAV can fly through a series of pipes to generating a 3D map of the flight path. We used Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology to map the surrounding environment as the UAV flies through the environment. The feedback from the LIDAR sensors is used for real-time autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. The route is also logged for subsequent navigation. As a UAV navigates the environment, it records a video of all it sees which can then be watched by the maintenance engineers. Our approach involves running a simulation using the Robotics Operating System (ROS) to assert and fine-tune our navigation algorithms before applying them directly to the physical hardware. At this stage, we have successfully implemented the autonomous navigation using LIDAR scanners in the ROS simulation environment. We also implemented an algorithm to manage the battery life of the UAV through which it can use to return home when the battery level drops down to a certain percentage. We expect that this research will help autonomous UAVs to safely navigate new spaces by themselves in different domains such as in industrial maintenance and rescue operations.",60007618,Prairie View A and M University,Prairie View,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.90909090909091,0.23395230500493658,0.5170729854940381,1

Doing exercise at home is an attractive choice for many people due to its convenience and low cost. Motivated by this, we propose FitAssist in this paper, a household virtual fitness assistant capable of performing fine-grained exercise recognition and exercise quality assessment based on commercial WiFi devices. Unlike wearable devices based systems, this system is more comfortable and device-free. In addition, compared to previous Wi-Fi based exercise monitoring systems, whose performance attenuates seriously when users stand out of the First Fresnel Zone (FFZ), FitAssist does not require users to stand on or near the line of sight (LoS) path. To achieve this, FitAssist extracts features from the fine-grained WiFi channel state information (CSI) and enables both exercise recognition and user identification via deep learning techniques. Moreover, FitAssist can provide personalized workout assessment to help users obtain effective workout and prevent injury.

Since text detection and recognition algorithms are usually time-consuming, and it is unnecessary to run them on images that do not contain any texts. In this paper, we investigate this problem from two perspectives: the speed and the accuracy. First, to achieve high speed for efficient filtering large number of images especially on CPU, we propose using small and shallow convolutional neural network, where the features from different layers are adaptively pooled into certain sizes to overcome difficulties caused by multiple scales and various locations. Although this can achieve high speed but its accuracy is not satisfactory due to limited capacity of small network. Therefore, our second contribution is using the knowledge distillation to improve the accuracy of the small network, by constructing a larger and deeper neural network as teacher network to instruct the learning process of the small network. With the above two strategies, we can achieve both high speed and high accuracy for filtering scene text images. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset have shown the effectiveness of our method: the teacher network yields state-of-the-art performance, and the distilled small network achieves high performance while maintaining high speed which is 176 times faster on CPU and 3.8 times faster on GPU than a compared benchmark method.",60022381,Beijing Jiaotong University,Beijing,China,['1707'],28.125,-0.006592775041050898,0.4565927750410508,1

In this work, we propose a robust digital watermarking scheme for securing genuine documents by leveraging generative adversarial networks (GAN). To begin with, the input document is adjusted to its right form by geometric correction. Next, the generated document is obtained from the input document by using the mentioned networks, and it is regarded as a reference for data hiding and detection. We then introduce an algorithm that hides a secret information into the document and produces a watermarked document whose content is minimally distorted in terms of normal observation. Furthermore, we also present a method that detects the hidden data from the watermarked document by measuring the distance of pixel values between the generated and watermarked document. For improving the security feature, we encode the secret information prior to hiding it by using pseudo random numbers.

111,111,Electrospun diamond-silk membranes for biosensing applications," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.This work reports nanodiamond-silk membranes as an optical platform for biosensing and cell growth applications. The hybrid structure was fabricated through electrospinning and mimics a 2D scaffold with high porosity. The negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) centres in diamond exhibits optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which enables sensing of temperature variations. The NV-centre, as reported in literature, provides a shift of 74 kHz in the ODMR frequency per degree rise in temperature. For our hybrid membranes, we have however observed that the embedded NV-centre provide a greater shift of 95±5 kHz/K in the ODMR frequency. This higher shift in the frequency will result in improved temperature sensitivity enabling the tracking of thermal variations in the biologically relevant window of 25-50 °C. The thermal conductivity of silk and diamond-silk hybrid will be explored to investigate this enhanced temperature sensing ability of diamond. The hybrid diamond-silk membranes are found to be hydrophilic with a contact angle of (65±2)°.

The cost of software errors is very high in largescale supercomputer simulations. Reproducing and localizing errors, especially ""magic"" unstable bugs related with wrong memory access, are extremely problematic due to the large amount of computing resources involved. In order to prevent, or at least notably filter out memory bugs, an approach of increased reliability is proposed for representing mesh data and organizing memory access. A set of containers is proposed, which causes no overhead in the release configuration compared to plain arrays. At the same time, it provides throughout access control in the safe mode configuration and additional compile-time protection from programming errors. Furthermore, it is fully compatible with heterogeneous computing within the OpenCL standard.

However, is it very hard to transpose the successes demonstrated in liquid and physiological environment toward the detection of gasous molecules. In fact, the latter typically adsorb in an unspecific manner and induce very minute refractive index changes tipicaly below the sensor sensitivity. Here, we show first insights on the aerosol large-scale self-Assembly of metasurfaces made of monocrystalline Au nanoislands with uniform disorder over large scale. Notably, these architectures show tuneable disorder levels and demonstrate high-quality LSPR, enabling the fabrication of highly performing optical gas sensors detecting down to 10-5 variations in refractive index. Next, we use our aerosol synthesis method to integrate tailored fractals of dielectric TiO2 nanoparticles onto resonant plasmonic metasurfaces. We show how this integration strongly enhances the interaction between the plasmonic field and volatile organic molecules and provides a means for their selective detection. Interesting, the improved performance is the result of a synergetic behavior between the dielectric fractals and the plasmonic metasurface: in fact, upon this integration, the enhancement of plasmonic field is drastically extended, all the way up to a maximum thickness of 1.8 μm. Optimal dielectric-plasmonic structures allow measurements of changes in the refractive index of the gas mixture down to <8x10-6at room temperature and selective identification of three exemplary volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These findings provide a basis for the development of a novel family of hybrid dielectric-plasmonic materials with application extending from light harvesting and photo-catalysts to contactless sensors for non-invasive medical diagnostics.",60008950,Australian National University,Canberra,Australia,['1706'],28.4,0.11768674136321196,0.3715989729225023,0

It is essential to know the behavior of the physiological variables involved in this process, with these variables the states of attention of a person can be determined with greater precision. Several disorders affect the level of attention of people both in their childhood and in adulthood. One of the most recognized disorders is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is usually diagnosed for the first time in childhood, and the symptoms persist in adolescence and adulthood. Some ways of knowing if a person presents ADHD are through questionnaires, intellectual tests, types of behavior, medical diagnoses, among others. These tests require a long period where an observation and analysis process is performed in order to obtain a reliable diagnosis. In this work, we present the development of an experiment for the identification of ADHD.

These sources included truncated Gaussians, multiple Gaussians, other non-Gaussian, Lorentzian, square and triangular sources. Only the pure Gaussian source produced A-scans without false artefacts such as satellite peaks, that could produce misinterpretation of real OCT images that may be used for patient diagnosis.

125,125,The influence of project characteristics on project success factors. Insights from 21 real life project cases from Norway," Published by Elsevier B.V.Although there are many studies that have identified individual critical success factors in projects the number of studies that have examined how project characteristics such as organizational complexity, transformation, impact on business, constraints, and uncertainty should influence the choice and implantation of project success factors. The study is based on analyzing 21 project cases from a wide spectrum of applications and industries in Norway. In total, c.120 business professionals contributed to the analysis of the cases in order to establish the framework through group work, individual assignments, and group discussions under supervision of the author. For each project characteristic we have identified a set of context dependent success factors that must be adhered to in order to increase the likelihood of success using the 21 projects as an empirical foundation for the analysis. In addition, the findings suggest that there are success factors that are independent of the project characteristics.

In order to accurately place the number of bicycles, this paper predicts the demand for shared bicycles based on factors such as weather, seasonality and temperature and humidity. Faced with the complexity and collinearity of data features, a random forest prediction shared bicycle demand model with improved feature selection is proposed. First, features with collinearity are excluded by partitioning the feature saliency and correlation coefficient values. Then, the data is effectively characterized. Therefore, the upper bound of the generalization error of the algorithm is reduced. The final prediction model improves prediction accuracy. Experiments show that the random forest algorithm with improved feature selection is optimized, which is compared to other regression algorithms in terms of demand prediction accuracy and fitness.

The most common way to use unlabeled data is unsupervised pretraining, which has been successfully applied to various CNN and RNN architectures in different domains. There is however not sufficient work for its application in the field of OCR. In this paper we investigate multiple architectures and how unlabeled data could be applied to them.

129,129,Optimization of avoiding accidents by maintaining traffic monitoring conditions,". All rights reserved.A network that is designed to provide an efficient, uninterrupted route and a flexible path for the flow of vehicles are termed as Freeway networks. These networks are very useful in Metropolitan cities where the volume of traffic is extremely heavy. When vehicles reached the highway, depending upon the traffic situations speed of each and every vehicle will be varied. Due to congestion, recurrent and non-recurrent situations of traffic will happen under peak hours as well as other incidents happening on the highway. The major occurrences due to congestion are speed reduction, lengthy travelling time, high fuel consumption and pollution due to vehicle emission. Along with the aforesaid aspects, the probability of occurrences of accidents will be frequent. Generally the solution for avoiding congestion becomes very difficult, because of economic, environmental and urban traffic situations. An integrated control and integrated surveillance strategy has been adopted from 1960 onwards to optimize the traffic conditions. In recent years, a new effective approach to control and manage the freeway traffic is known as metering strategies.

132,132,TableNet: Deep learning model for end-to-end table detection and tabular data extraction from scanned document images,"With the widespread use of mobile phones and scanners to photograph and upload documents, the need for extracting the information trapped in unstructured document images such as retail receipts, insurance claim forms and financial invoices is becoming more acute. A major hurdle to this objective is that these images often contain information in the form of tables and extracting data from tabular sub-images presents a unique set of challenges. This includes accurate detection of the tabular region within an image, and subsequently detecting and extracting information from the rows and columns of the detected table. While some progress has been made in table detection, extracting the table contents is still a challenge since this involves more fine grained table structure(rows & columns) recognition. Prior approaches have attempted to solve the table detection and structure recognition problems independently using two separate models. In this paper, we propose TableNet: a novel end-to-end deep learning model for both table detection and structure recognition. The model exploits the interdependence between the twin tasks of table detection and table structure recognition to segment out the table and column regions. This is followed by semantic rule-based row extraction from the identified tabular sub-regions. The proposed model and extraction approach was evaluated on the publicly available ICDAR 2013 and Marmot Table datasets obtaining state of the art results. Additionally, we demonstrate that feeding additional semantic features further improves model performance and that the model exhibits transfer learning across datasets. Another contribution of this paper is to provide additional table structure annotations for the Marmot data, which currently only has annotations for table detection.",60069548,Tata Consultancy Services India,Pune,India,['1707'],24.181818181818183,0.1844298245614035,0.4451754385964913,1
133,133,An end-to-end video text detector with online tracking,"Video text detection is considered as one of the most difficult tasks in document analysis due to the following two challenges: 1) the difficulties caused by video scenes, i.e., motion blur, illumination changes, and occlusion; 2) the properties of text including variants of fonts, languages, orientations, and shapes. Most existing methods attempt to enhance the performance of video text detection by cooperating with video text tracking, but treat these two tasks separately. In this work, we propose an end-to-end video text detection model with online tracking to address these two challenges. Specifically, in the detection branch, we adopt ConvLSTM to capture spatial structure information and motion memory. In the tracking branch, we convert the tracking problem to text instance association, and an appearance-geometry descriptor with memory mechanism is proposed to generate robust representation of text instances. By integrating these two branches into one trainable framework, they can promote each other and the computational cost is significantly reduced. Experiments on existing video text benchmarks including ICDAR2013 Video, Minetto and YVT demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Serious games, for instance, have been applied as a complementary therapy for neuromuscular disorders, being the game design process a key factor to influence both the attractiveness and effectiveness of the game. In this paper, we expose a design methodology used for the creation of a serious videogame for motor rehabilitation of upper limbs using surface electromyography (sEMG) as the human-computer interface to control the game and monitor the players' fatigue levels. By using an adaptation mechanism from the physiological computing field, called biocybernetic adaptation; the videogame can adapt the game difficulty based on measured fatigue levels.

Stacking is a framework algorithm. Based on the Stacking framework, in this paper, we introduce a new oversampling algorithm EKSMOTE and cost-sensitive theory into Stacking, and propose the EKCStacking algorithm. The algorithm uses the EKSMOTE algorithm to reduce imbalanced ratio of data set before data training, and then the Level 1 layer uses a cost-sensitive classifier.

Most of these diseases occur in developing countries. One of the main reasons for this problem, after gestational hypertension and complications in childbirth, is infections. Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) during pregnancy is one of the main causes for fetal-maternal morbidity and mortality in Mexico. Among others, the pervasiveness and heterogeneity of data in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) complicates early diagnosis and treatment of UTI. OBJECTIVES: Our goal is extract empirical knowledge, in the form of association rules, that generalize symptomatology and treatment of UTI patients with positive and nagative diagnosis. METHODS: In this study, we developed a criterion to extract words and expressions that uniquely characterize each patient class. We extracted association rules from EMRs and evaluated its level of correspondence between the rules and the extracted word sets. RESULTS: By defining a bound on word frequency usage and evaluating the positive to negative word ratio we were able to identify word sets that uniquely characterize each patient class. A bound of 47 enabled extraction of 25 unique words and expressions for each patient class. Further, approximately 17% and 27% of association rules drew terms from each word set correspondingly. CONCLUSION: This work seeks to promote the creation of more effective criterions to extract features, from EMRs, that improve characterization of patients and that ultimately lead to a more accurate diagnosis of UTIs.",60008442,CETYS Universidad,Mexicali,Mexico,['1701'],19.333333333333332,0.21240358126721767,0.5479958677685951,1

However, most related studies optimize a global distance objective and suffer from a low discriminative power due to the loss of temporal information. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end, neural network-based framework for learning local representations of time series, and demonstrate its effectiveness for online signature verification. This framework optimizes a Siamese network with a local embedding loss, and learns a feature space that preserves the temporal location-wise distances between time series. To achieve invariance to non-linear temporal distortion, we propose building a dynamic time warping block on top of the Siamese network, which will greatly improve the accuracy for local correspondences across intra-personal variability.

139,139,Synthesis of handwriting dynamics using sinusoidal model,"Handwriting production is a complex mechanism of fine motor control, associated with mainly two degrees of freedom in the horizontal and vertical directions. The relation between the horizontal and vertical velocities depends on the trajectory shape and its length. In this work, we explore the generation of handwriting velocities using two sinusoidal oscillations. The proposed method follows the motor equivalence theory and considers that the patterns are stored in the form of a sequence of corner shapes and its relative location in the letter. These points are referred to as the modulation points, where the parameters of the sinusoidal oscillations are modulated to generate required velocity profiles. Depending on the location and shape of the corners, the amplitude, phase, and frequency relations between the two underlying oscillations are changed. Accordingly, this paper presents an efficient method to synthesize the velocity profiles and hence the handwriting. Further, the shape variability in the synthesized data can also be introduced by modifying the position of the modulation points and its corner shapes. The quality of the synthesized handwriting is evaluated using both subjective and quantitative evaluation methods.",60114348,Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad,Dharwad,India,['1707'],20.444444444444443,0.056666666666666664,0.3466666666666667,1

It combines the AES round function and simple Boolean operations to update its large state and extract a keystream to achieve an excellent software performance. In 2014, Minaud discovered slight biases in the keystream based on linear characteristics. For family member AEGIS-256, these could be exploited to undermine the confidentiality faster than generic attacks, but this still requires very large amounts of data. For final portfolio member AEGIS-128, these attacks are currently less efficient than generic attacks.

We present the demonstration Jive (Joint Integration of VLC and Encryption), a framework to support secret key sharing over Visible Light Communication. In defining Jive, we tackle challenges related to data encoding, message synchronization, and environmental noise to build a reliable, low complexity system using off-the shelf hardware. Our system is capable of sending encryption keys at speeds of more than 750bps using ultra short, high speed light pulses imperceptible to the human eye. Additionally, we have developed an application for Android that interfaces with the VLC device through serial communication so that applications running on mobile devices can subsequently use the keys to encrypt application data.

157,157,Cube-based cryptanalysis of subterranean-SAE," All rights reserved.Subterranean 2.0 designed by Daemen, Massolino and Rotella is a Round 2 candidate of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography Standardization process. In the official document of Subterranean 2.0, the designers have analyzed the state collisions in unkeyed absorbing by reducing the number of rounds to absorb the message from 2 to 1. However, little cryptanalysis of the authenticated encryption scheme Subterranean-SAE is made. For Subterranean-SAE, the designers introduce 8 blank rounds to separate the controllable input and output, and expect that 8 blank rounds can achieve a sufficient diffusion. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate the security by reducing the number of blank rounds. Moreover, the designers make no security claim but expect a non-trivial effort to achieve full-state recovery in a nonce-misuse scenario. In this paper, we present the first practical full-state recovery attack in a nonce-misuse scenario with data complexity of 213 32-bit blocks. In addition, in a nonce-respecting scenario and if the number of blank rounds is reduced to 4, we can mount a key-recovery attack with 2122 calls to the internal permutation of Subterranean-SAE and 269.5 32-bit blocks. A distinguishing attack with 233 calls to the internal permutation of Subterranean-SAE and 233 32-bit blocks is achieved as well.

158,158,A text localization method based on weak supervision,"Recently, numerous deep learning based scene text detection methods have achieved promising performances in different text detecting tasks. Most of these methods are trained in a supervised way, which requires a large amount of annotated data. In this paper, we explore a weakly supervised method to locate text regions in scene images. We propose a fully convolutional network (FCN) architecture to implement binary classification. The training data we used do not need any text location annotation, we only need to divide the training data into two categories according to whether it contains text or not. We can obtain the text localization map (TLM) directly from the last convolutional layer. By setting a fixed threshold, the TLM is converted to a mask map. Then the connected component analysis and the text proposals method based on Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) are used to get the text region bounding boxes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on standard text datasets. The results show that our text localization method achieves comparable recall performance with other methods and has more stable property.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1707'],17.6,0.07959183673469387,0.435374149659864,1

However, in some tasks, such as the verification of handwritten signatures, the amount of publicly available data is scarce, what makes difficult to test the real limits of deep learning. In addition to the lack of public data, it is not easy to evaluate the improvements of novel approaches compared with the state of the art as different experimental protocols and conditions are usually considered for different signature databases. To tackle all these mentioned problems, the main contribution of this study is twofold: i) we present and describe the new DeepSignDB on-line handwritten signature biometric public database, and ii) we propose a standard experimental protocol and benchmark to be used for the research community in order to perform a fair comparison of novel approaches with the state of the art.

Due to large volume and variety of invoices across multiple suppliers, it is not pragmatic to manually examine every invoice to check if it is legitimate and has not been previously financed. This paper presents Digital Auditor (DA), an automated framework for detecting duplicate invoices. It is based on two principles 1) converting invoices into structured templates by extracting relevant information from the invoices and organizing it as key-value pairs and 2) machine learning based duplicate detection algorithm which compares corresponding fields between two invoices and identifies duplicate invoice pairs. Digital Auditor efficiently identifies duplicate pairs, and thus alleviates laborious manual efforts and time in inspecting the invoices against the previously paid invoices.

Sonoluminescence, the emission of light from acoustically-induced collapse of air bubbles in water, is an efficient means of generating UV-C light. However, because a spherical bubble collapsing in the bulk of water creates isotropic radiation, the fluence of the generated UV-C radiation is insufficient for disinfection. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that we can create a UV light beam from aspherical air bubble collapse near a gallium-based liquid-metal microparticle. The beam is perpendicular to the metal surface and is caused by the interaction of sonoluminescence light with UV plasmon modes in the metal. We calculate that such beams are capable of generating UV-C fluences exceeding 10mJ/cm2, which is sufficient to irreversibly inactivate 99.9% of pathogens in water with the turbidity of more than 5NTU.",60030804,Swinburne University of Technology,Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],26.333333333333332,0.21428571428571427,0.5142857142857143,0

All rights reserved.A mobile ad hoc network is a collection of independent nodes that communicate with each other through a multi-hop radio network and keep up connections in a decentralized manner. Security remains a major challenge for thesetypes of networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically change in topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Most of the routing protocols for MANETs are thus vulnerable to many types of attacks. Ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing is a very efficient routing algorithm. However, it is insecure to the well-known black hole attack, where a malicious node falsely claims that have a best path to a destination node during the route discovery process. This attack becomes more serious when more than one malicious nodes present within network, called multiple black hole attack. In this paper, a defense mechanism hybrid and clustering is presented against to multiple black hole nodes in a MANET.

In turn, the edge computing paradigm pushes computations and storage beyond the data center, closer to end-user devices where data is generated and consumed. Thus, enabling the execution of certain components of edge-enabled systems directly and cooperatively on edge devices. In this paper, we address the challenge of supporting reliable and efficient data storage and dissemination among co-located wireless mobile devices without resorting to centralized services or network infrastructures. We propose Thyme, a novel time-aware reactive data storage system for wireless edge networks, that exploits synergies between the storage substrate and the publish/subscribe paradigm. We present the design of Thyme and evaluate it through simulation, characterizing the scenarios best suited for its use. The evaluation shows that Thyme allows for reliable notification and retrieval of relevant data with low overhead and latency.",60022729,"Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa",Caparica,Portugal,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.11111111111111,0.2127551020408163,0.43673469387755104,1

According to the observations of children with this type of malformation, they have difficulty in their development and social participation, showing shyness and low relationships with peers; generally their limited participation is improved in artistic activities which also require coordination and controlled use of both hands, making this type of activity ideal for the child's rehabilitation. The project was focused on modeling and prototyping in 3D and ran for 5 months (around 17 hours of therapy). The development of the therapies was performed by a multidisciplinary team, consisting of an industrial designer in training, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists at the Laboratory of University Manuela Beltran, with children between 3 to 8 years. The approach to the therapies was to invite playful exploration and creation of clay models using assistive technologies in gradually more complex tasks using an attachable proto-prothesis.

Using erroneous data such as data with missing values, class imbalance, and skew, may affect model performance and classification outcome. Often when models have poor performance, practitioners focus on improving models but overlook quality processing as it requires the involvement of data experts or data owners who have an intimate understanding of the data. Furthermore, performing data quality processing is challenging in that there is no one-size-fits-all optimal solution that is suitable for all types of data and models. Therefore, a unique combination of data quality processing methods is required for each dataset and model prior to model generation in order to identify the most appropriate set of methods that can improve the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Finding the most effective way to prepare data requires many manual iterations of trial and error.

180,180,Exploring the temperature dependent dielectric properties of adipose tissue in the THz range," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Terahertz (THz) frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum is defined as radiation of 0.1 to 10.0 x 1012 Hz (corresponding to wavelengths of 3.0 mm to 0.03 mm). Water in the liquid state has a very high absorption coefficient in the lower THz region1 (80-350 cm-1 at 0.1-2.0 THz), with ∼90% of the energy being absorbed in the first 0.10 mm at 0.6-0.9 THz at 350 C. The THz absorption coefficient of ice, on the other hand is only in the order of 1.0-7.0 cm-1 in the same range2. This, two orders of magnitude difference between the THz absorption of ice and liquid water is a unique feature of the 0.1-2.0 THz range. The water content of most normal tissue, including the dermis and the deeper layers of the epidermis is in the order of 70-73%. The water content of body adipose tissue (fat) is about 20% adults3, thus, freezing the water content in tissues will have a significant influence on THz absorption properties even in adipose tissue. The properties of other, non-water, non-fat components of adipose tissue will also have an influence. The potential for medical imaging or therapeutic intervention at body, room or freezing temperature becomes dependent, in part, on the behavior of the dielectric properties non-water elements of living tissues. These elements have a much lower absorption coefficient, generally in the order of 10-20 cm-1, and do not change on freezing to the same extent as water4,5. The preliminary exploration of the concept of the viability of the THz-skin freezing imaging technique in skin was undertaken using computational modelling6. The depth of the dermis in humans is in the range of 2 to 5 mm and thus freezing the skin for examination may involve subcutaneous adipose. It follows that before any advance can be made the temperature dependent properties of adipose tissue need to be understood. One poorly understood aspect is the presence of a phase change in the adipose tissue, analogous to the one observed with butter becoming soft at room temperature, after being firm at refrigerator temperatures (40 C). The attenuated total reflection (ATR) apparatus at the Australian synchrotron provides for a rapid acquisition of data in a temperature controlled environment, with individual sets of readings taking in the order of 1-3 minutes. This provides an appropriate environment for the study of the changes in absorption coefficients in the samples, and to ascertain the utility of ATR for diagnostic applications.",60030804,Swinburne University of Technology,Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],27.666666666666668,0.10432000000000001,0.5124133333333333,0

182,182,Test case generation from BPMN with DMN,"Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is applied to manage business processes. Currently, business processes are becoming more complex with increasing conditions. As a result, it is highly difficult to manage activities and decision-making in business processes. However, BPMN still cannot handle the decision-making in business processes. Object management group (OMG) created Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to complement BPMN and to manage the decision-making of business processes. In software development process, creating a business process model can occur earlier during requirement gathering. However, a tester can generate test cases to verify accuracy of information in the business process. Previously, many researchers have focused on BPMN test cases generation. None of their studies has been conducted on the creation of BPMN test cases with DMN. Consequently, this paper proposes an approach to generate test cases from BPMN with DMN. BPMN along with DMN, paths traverse from the entry to the exit of the BPMN, and existing test cases are inputs of our approach. BPMN, DMN, and existing test cases are analyzed to check whether they cover all rules in the DMN. In case that all rules are not covered, new test cases will be generated.

We show that if the comb line spacing of the optical frequency comb is adjusted to be at 120° intervals of the periodic spectral response of the used Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the transmission power values of the three comb lines are recorded over time, it is possible to extract the interferometer phase linearly and continuously for every sample point. This measurement approach provides an accurate phase measurement and is independent of the interferometer bias. Furthermore, it is robust against intensity fluctuations which are common to all three used comb lines.

Existing deployed algorithms, such as DCQCN, are still far from optimal in many plausible scenarios, particularly for tail latency. Many operators compensate by running their networks at low average utilization, dramatically increasing costs. In this paper, we argue that we have reached the practical limits of end-to-end congestion control. Instead, we propose a new clean slate design based on hop-by-hop per-flow flow control. We show that our approach achieves near optimal tail latency behavior even under challenging conditions such as high average link utilization and in-cast cross traffic. By contrast with prior hop-by-hop schemes, our main innovation is to show that per-flow flow control can be achieved with limited metadata and packet buffering.

195,195,Mask-guided attention network for occluded pedestrian detection,"Pedestrian detection relying on deep convolution neural networks has made significant progress. Though promising results have been achieved on standard pedestrians, the performance on heavily occluded pedestrians remains far from satisfactory. The main culprits are intra-class occlusions involving other pedestrians and inter-class occlusions caused by other objects, such as cars and bicycles. These results in a multitude of occlusion patterns. We propose an approach for occluded pedestrian detection with the following contributions. First, we introduce a novel mask-guided attention network that fits naturally into popular pedestrian detection pipelines. Our attention network emphasizes on visible pedestrian regions while suppressing the occluded ones by modulating full body features. Second, we empirically demonstrate that coarse-level segmentation annotations provide reasonable approximation to their dense pixel-wise counterparts. Experiments are performed on CityPersons and Caltech datasets. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on both datasets. Our approach obtains an absolute gain of 9.5% in log-average miss rate, compared to the best reported results [32] on the heavily occluded HO pedestrian set of CityPersons test set. Further, on the HO pedestrian set of Caltech dataset, our method achieves an absolute gain of 5.0% in log-average miss rate, compared to the best reported results [13].

196,196,Construct a three-stage analysis model of integrated main path analysis and patent family-exploring the development of blockchain," Publication rights licensed to ACM.Regarding the evolution of technology, many scholars have used patent citations, main path analysis and other methods to explore their development path ([1];[2]). These methods, however, are mostly external perspective of the company, which are the self-citing or mutual citation of the patent literature in essence, focusing on analyzing the evolutionary path of the past and the present. This paper proposes a three-stage analysis model of Integrated Main Path analysis and Patent Family (IMP&PF) by connecting with the internal strategic management perspective of the company's technology R&D. Firstly, establishing a research dataset is according to the research purpose; secondly, integrating the main path analysis method is based on patent citation, and find out the direction of dominant technical knowledge flow in the industry, as well as know well the assignees of the key patented technologies; and then analyze the patent families of the assignees, in order to gain insight into the strategic intent of their patent portfolio and consider these patents as potential candidates for standard essential patents (SEP). This method takes the developing technology of blockchain as the research target. Through the mutual verification of the analysis of results and market information, it can be found that this method can explain the development of the technology-driven market. With the analysis method proposed in this paper, emerging technology investors can apply to predict the patent portfolio intention and technology development direction of critical technology leaders, and then to decide how their companies' technical resources are invested when they with mature technology companies can think about how to make breadth of applications or even different industry alliances.",60025502,Chaoyang University of Technology,Taichung,Taiwan,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",38.714285714285715,0.048749999999999995,0.3279166666666666,0

In this regard, we employ a GMM-based feature representation where in each point-based feature vector in the online trace is represented by a vector. Each element of the aforementioned vector quantify the membership to a particular Gaussian in the GMM. A differing aspect is in the proposal of a weighting scheme that measures the influence of each Gaussian of a writer in the probabilistic space. For deriving these weights, we rely on the information obtained from a histogram, by formulating a function of the sum-pooled posterior probabilities obtained across all the enrolled documents in the database.

207,207,Formalizing a decision table into petri nets,"Business workflow designers use decision tables to lay out all possible business rules in the so-called IF-THEN format. However, as the business process continue to develop iteratively, the business rules are likely to explode considerably. This usually leads to an inadvertently error-prone design of the business process. Therefore, some designers employ a visualization technique to help them comprehend the decision tables more profoundly and mitigate the design errors. This paper proposes a scheme to visualize the decision tables using Petri nets. A Petri net is a formal method that is used to illustrate business flows and decision paths of the decision table. Our method starts with defining a set of rules which transforms a decision table into a Petri net model. Next, the table is transformed into a Petri net model. This transforming process often disclose inconsistent rules and redundant rules. After refining the table and obtaining a final model, a simulation tool is then used to animate the Petri net model. This allows the designers to verify the internal working of the decision table, identify its flaws, and fix the errors more precisely.",60028190,Chulalongkorn University,Bangkok,Thailand,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",16.727272727272727,0.07083333333333333,0.41875,1

209,209,A robust fault detection and prediction scheme for nonlinear discrete time input-output systems," All rights reserved.Model-based fault detection (MFD) techniques are preferred over hardware based schemes due to low cost and minimal changes to the system when the system states are available. However, one of the major challenges in model based monitoring, diagnosis and prognosis (MDP) approach was to develop a detection and prognosis (DP) scheme in discretetime in the presence of partial state information since discrete-time schemes are normally preferred for ease of implementation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a unified fault detection and prediction (FDP) scheme for a nonlinear discrete-time input-output system in the presence of modeling uncertainties when certain states are not available for measurement. A nonlinear estimator with an online tunable approximator and a robust term is introduced to monitor the system. A residual is generated by comparing the output of the system with that of the estimator. A unknown fault is detected when the generated residual exceeds a mathematically derived threshold. Subsequently, the online approximator and the robust terms are initiated. The approximator uses the system input and output measurements while its own parameters are tuned online using a novel update law. Additionally, robustness, sensitivity, and the stability of the fault detection scheme are rigorously examined. The proposed scheme is guaranteed to be asymptotically stable due to the introduction of the robust term and using some mild assumption on the system uncertainty. Subsequently the process of determining the time to failure (TTF) is introduced. Finally, the FDP scheme is simulated on a magnetic suspension system.",60024728,Missouri University of Science and Technology,Rolla,United States,"['1706', '1702']",20.75,0.038525132275132275,0.44285714285714284,0

However, table structure identification is a hard problem not only because of the large variation in the table layouts and styles, but also owing to the variations in the page layouts and the noise contamination levels. A lot of research has been done to identify table structure, most of which is based on applying heuristics with the aid of optical character recognition (OCR) to hand pick layout features of the tables. These methods fail to generalize well because of the variations in the table layouts and the errors generated by OCR. In this paper, we have proposed a robust deep learning based approach to extract rows and columns from a detected table in document images with a high precision. In the proposed solution, the table images are first pre-processed and then fed to a bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) followed by a fully-connected layer with softmax activation.

222,222,Fall Prevention as Personal Learning and Changing Behaviors: Systems and Technologies," Published by Elsevier B.V.While living longer at home is the preferred option for the elderly, disease, accidents or general health decline might make this hard. Fall accidents, which are among the chief causes of unforced injury leading to hospitalization, must be viewed as a strong factor working against the possibilities for the elderly of living longer at home. Although many fall prevention programs have been developed and applied, and checklists and advice abound, most of these originate in the professional care area or depend on care professionals. In this paper, we present a fall prevention concept directed towards elderly people living at home, with the intention of providing a safer environment ensuring more years of doing this in a healthy manner. There are several obstacles for a successful implementation of fall prevention, many pending on the attitudes and thought systems of the elderly user community, including low risk awareness, technological stigmata, refusal to be associated with health problems and a general ""not for me"" world view. The paper presents an AI/IoT-driven learning environment for fall prevention which facilitates living independently and improved self-understanding to provide for easier everyday living. The central design idea is to lead the user through a learning process including acquiring knowledge of fall prevention, personal characteristics, taking fall prevention action and understanding the outcomes of changed behaviors. The concluding outcome is a discussion of a set of design variables for the effective implementation of fall prevention systems, including a holistic view of fall prevention and aging, open platform technologies, a flexible and adaptable module approach, feedback-based learning, IoT/sensor-driven learning, personalization and goal orientation and the dual use of technology avoiding technology stigmas.",60108011,"Linnaeus University, Växjö",Vaxjo,Sweden,['1700'],34.625,0.18007246376811595,0.39565217391304347,0
223,223,Enhanced privacy governance in Health Information Systems throughbusiness process modelling and HL7," Published by Elsevier B.V.Medical data privacy is nowadays an alarming issue thanks to the technological revolution witnessed in the medical field and the ease of data access and exchange leveraged by newly implemented Hospital Information Systems (HIS). In order to help protect patient data while offering them the required medical procedures, many computerized techniques could be made available to be implemented in HIS since an early stage of their design. Those techniques should be applied throughout the rolling of clinical pathways to preserve medical data privacy and security in order to enhance privacy governance within Hospitals. When considered as processes, and because of their complexity and multidisciplinary nature, clinical pathways should be modelled in a simple way paying attention to medical tasks and the underlining shared clinical data. It is important to highlight the data with higher protection and sensitivity level. These data characteristics will influence many governance and security decisions of each process. This work aims to present a methodology to model clinical pathway specifications for data driven clinical processes, distinguishing sensitive data from other data and identifying personal data protection principles and the Protected Health Information (PHI). In this context, we precise for each clinical task potentially involving data processing and sharing, the level of protection the data requires through the use of privacy tags and labels added to data elements predefined using the HL7 standard. This method of tagging would help mapping extracted data, classified into categories, to a set of privacy requirements as needed by the HIPAA legislation. Hence data protection and privacy governance are leveraged in a seamless and highly transparent way. The use of HL7 allowed better data discovery and parsing which facilitates the definition of medical data protection measures at a later stage.",60045778,University of Tunis El Manar,Tunis,Tunisia,['1700'],26.454545454545453,0.13543706293706295,0.35871878121878115,0

This method extracts and mixes background only images (BOI) with text only images (TOI) issued from two different sources to create semi-synthetic images. The TOIs are extracted with the help of a binary mask obtained by binarizing the image. The BOIs are reconstructed from the original image by replacing TOI pixels using an inpainting method. Finally, a TOI can be efficiently integrated in a BOI using the gradient domain, thus creating a new semi-synthetic image. The idea behind this technique is to automatically obtain documents close to real ones with different backgrounds to highlight the content.

In the proposed framework, each entity is parsed by its corresponding entity-aware decoder, respectively. Moreover, we innovatively introduce a state transition mechanism which further improves the robustness of visual ToI extraction.

229,229,Rethinking table recognition using graph neural networks,"Document structure analysis, such as zone segmentation and table recognition, is a complex problem in document processing and is an active area of research. The recent success of deep learning in solving various computer vision and machine learning problems has not been reflected in document structure analysis since conventional neural networks are not well suited to the input structure of the problem. In this paper, we propose an architecture based on graph networks as a better alternative to standard neural networks for table recognition. We argue that graph networks are a more natural choice for these problems, and explore two gradient-based graph neural networks. Our proposed architecture combines the benefits of convolutional neural networks for visual feature extraction and graph networks for dealing with the problem structure. We empirically demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline by a significant margin. In addition, we identify the lack of large scale datasets as a major hindrance for deep learning research for structure analysis and present a new large scale synthetic dataset for the problem of table recognition.

230,230,FAB: Toward flow-aware buffer sharing on programmable switches,"Conventional buffer sizing techniques consider an output port with multiple queues in isolation and provide guidelines for the size of the queue. In practice, however, switches consist of several ports that share a buffering chip. Hence, chip manufacturers, such as Broadcom, are left to devise a set of proprietary resource sharing algorithms to allocate buffers across ports. This algorithm dynamically adjusts the buffer size for output queues and directly impacts the packet loss and latency of individual queues. We show that the problem of allocating buffers across ports, although less known, is indeed responsible for fundamental inefficiencies in today's devices. In particular, the per-port buffer allocation is an ad-hoc decision that (at best) depends on the remaining buffer cells on the chip instead of the type of traffic. In this work, we advocate for a flow-aware and device-wide buffer sharing scheme (FAB), which is practical today in programmable devices. We tested FAB on two specific workloads and showed that it can improve the tail flow completion time by an order of magnitude compared to conventional buffer management techniques.",60025858,ETH Zürich,"Zurich ZH,",Switzerland,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.25,0.07802197802197804,0.26071428571428573,1

The SROIE tasks play a key role in many document analysis systems and hold significant commercial potential. Although a lot of work has been published over the years on administrative document analysis, the community has advanced relatively slowly, as most datasets have been kept private. One of the key contributions of SROIE to the document analysis community is to offer a first, standardized dataset of 1000 whole scanned receipt images and annotations, as well as an evaluation procedure for such tasks. The Challenge is structured around three tasks, namely Scanned Receipt Text Localization (Task 1), Scanned Receipt OCR (Task 2) and Key Information Extraction from Scanned Receipts (Task 3).

233,233,Domain and schema independent ontology verbalizing,"The semantic web has gained vast popularity among current computer scientists and engineers, due to its remarkable attribute of machine readability and human readability. As evidence of witnessing that popularity, thousands of semantic web based knowledge models have been designed, to solve various problems emerging from different domains that are almost freely available in numerous repositories in the web. Semantic web based knowledge models also referred to as ontologies, are domain rich conceptualizations. Hence, they have been widely used to gain computational intelligence, related to areas such as medical sciences, law, management and many other disciplines. Nevertheless, the complexity associated with semantic web-based knowledge representations such as RDF and OWL act as a serious bottleneck in reusability and knowledge dissemination linked with the semantic web. Knowledge retrieval from an existing ontology solely depends on schematics understanding and writing of appropriate SPARQL or SQWRL queries. This would become a really challenging hurdle for non-computer specialists such as medical consultants, lawyers, criminologists who also wish to experience the benefits of semantic web-based technologies. This research emphasizes on proposing a generalized verbalizer which could act as domain and schema independent ontology verbalizer for both RDF and OWL ontologies in human readable English.

234,234,INT-RUP secure lightweight parallel AE modes," All rights reserved.Owing to the growing demand for lightweight cryptographic solutions, NIST has initiated a standardization process for lightweight cryptographic algorithms. Specific to authenticated encryption (AE), the NIST draft demands that the scheme should have one primary member that has key length of 128 bits, and it should be secure for at least 250 − 1 byte queries and 2112 computations. Popular (lightweight) modes, such as OCB, OTR, CLOC, SILC, JAMBU, COFB, SAEB, Beetle, SUNDAE etc., require at least 128-bit primitives to meet the NIST criteria, as all of them are just birthday bound secure. Furthermore, most of them are sequential, and they either use a two pass mode or they do not offer any security when the adversary has access to unverified plaintext (RUP model). In this paper, we propose two new designs for lightweight AE modes, called LOCUS and LOTUS, structurally similar to OCB and OTR, respectively. These modes achieve notably higher AE security bounds with lighter primitives (only a 64-bit tweakable block cipher). Especially, they satisfy the NIST requirements: secure as long as the data complexity is less than 264 bytes and time complexity is less than 2128, even when instantiated with a primitive with 64-bit block and 128-bit key. Both these modes are fully parallelizable and provide full integrity security under the RUP model. We use TweGIFT-64[4,16,16,4] (also referred as TweGIFT-64), a tweakable variant of the GIFT block cipher, to instantiate our AE modes. TweGIFT-64-LOCUS and TweGIFT-64-LOTUS are significantly light in hardware implementation.

237,237,Security of the suffix keyed sponge," All rights reserved.We formalize and analyze the general suffix keyed sponge construction, a pseudorandom function built on top of a cryptographic permutation. The construction hashes its data using the (keyless) sponge construction, transforms part of the state using the secret key, and generates the tag from the output of a final permutation call. In its simplest form, if the key and tag size are at most the rate of the sponge, one can see the suffix keyed sponge as a simple sponge function evaluation whose input is the plaintext appended with the key. The suffix keyed sponge is, however, much more general: the key and tag size may exceed the rate without any need to make extra permutation calls. We prove that the suffix keyed sponge construction achieves birthday-bound PRF security in the capacity, even if key and tag size exceed the rate. Furthermore, we prove that if the absorption of the key into the state happens in a leakage resilient manner, the suffix keyed sponge itself is leakage resilient as well. Our findings show that the suffix keyed sponge compares favorably with the hash-then-MAC construction. For instance, to reach a security level of k bits, the side-channel protected component in the suffix keyed sponge just needs to process k bits of input besides the key, whereas schemes following the hash-then-MAC construction need a side-channel protected MAC function that processes 2k bits of input besides the key. Moreover, even if we just consider black-box attacks, the MAC function in a hash-then-MAC scheme needs to be cryptographically strong whereas in the suffix keyed sponge the key may be absorbed by a simple XOR. The security proofs are performed using the H-coefficient technique, and make effective use of the multicollision limit function results of Daemen et al. (ASIACRYPT 2017), both for arguing that state manipulation larger than the rate is tolerated after key processing and for upper bounding the amount of leakage an attacker may gain about the secret key.",60016529,Radboud University Nijmegen,Nijmegen,Netherlands,"['1712', '1706']",29.90909090909091,0.07619047619047618,0.7052721088435374,0

Diamond containing the negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy colour centre (NV-) has emerged as a powerful room-Temperature sensing solution. Here we explore NV- centres as a laser medium for a new form of magnetometry: laser threshold magnetometry (LTM). LTM works by placing NV- inside an optical cavity and uses the coherent laser output as a potentially more sensitive readout channel than is possible using conventional (incoherent) optically detected magnetic resonance.

239,239,A game-theoretic framework for dynamic cyber deception in internet of battlefield things,"Cyber deception techniques are crucial to protect networks in battlefield settings and combat malicious cyber attacks. Cyber deception can effectively disrupt the surveillance process outcome of an adversary. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cyber deception to protect important nodes and trap the adversary. We present a sequential approach of honeypot placement to defend and protect the network vital nodes. We formulate a stochastic game to study the dynamic interactions between the network administrator and the attacker. The defender makes strategic decisions about where to place honeypots to introduce new vulnerabilities to the network. The attacker's goal is to develop an attack strategy to compromise the nodes of the network by exploiting a set of known vulnerabilities. To consider a practical threat model, we assume that the attacker can only observe a noisy version of the network state. To this end, both players solve a partially observable stochastic game (POSG).

242,242,"Attend, copy, parse end-to-end information extraction from documents","Document information extraction tasks performed by humans create data consisting of a PDF or document image input, and extracted string outputs. This end-to-end data is naturally consumed and produced when performing the task because it is valuable in and of itself. It is naturally available, at no additional cost. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art word classification methods for information extraction cannot use this data, instead requiring word-level labels which are expensive to create and consequently not available for many real life tasks. In this paper we propose the Attend, Copy, Parse architecture, a deep neural network model that can be trained directly on end-to-end data, bypassing the need for word-level labels. We evaluate the proposed architecture on a large diverse set of invoices, and outperform a state-of-the-art production system based on word classification. We believe our proposed architecture can be used on many real life information extraction tasks where word classification cannot be used due to a lack of the required word-level labels.",60011373,Danmarks Tekniske Universitet,Lyngby,Denmark,['1707'],22.857142857142858,0.0684065934065934,0.46950549450549456,1
243,243,Deck-based wide block cipher modes and an exposition of the blinded keyed hashing model," All rights reserved.We present two tweakable wide block cipher modes from doubly-extendable cryptographic keyed (deck) functions and a keyed hash function: double-decker and docked-double-decker. Double-decker is a direct generalization of Farfalle-WBC of Bertoni et al. (ToSC 2017(4)), and is a four-round Feistel network on two arbitrarily large branches, where the middle two rounds call deck functions and the first and last rounds call the keyed hash function. Docked-double-decker is a variant of double-decker where the bulk of the input to the deck functions is moved to the keyed hash functions. We prove that the distinguishing advantage of the resulting wide block ciphers is simply two times the sum of the pseudorandom function distinguishing advantage of the deck function and the blinded keyed hashing distinguishing advantage of the keyed hash functions. We demonstrate that blinded keyed hashing is more general than the conventional notion of XOR-universality, and that it allows us to instantiate our constructions with keyed hash functions that have a very strong claim on bkh security but not necessarily on XOR-universality, such as Xoofffie (ePrint 2018/767). The bounds of double-decker and docked-double-decker are moreover reduced tweak-dependent, informally meaning that collisions on the keyed hash function for different tweaks only have a limited impact. We describe two use cases that can exploit this property opportunistically to get stronger security than what would be achieved with prior solutions: SSD encryption, where each sector can only be written to a limited number of times, and incremental tweaks, where one includes the state of the system in the variable-length tweak and appends new data incrementally.",60016529,Radboud University Nijmegen,Nijmegen,Netherlands,"['1712', '1706']",32.875,0.060375836284927195,0.4334750098386462,0
245,245,Prototypical system to detect anxiety manifestations by acoustic patterns in patients with dementia,"INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a syndrome characterised by a decline in memory, language, and problem-solving that affects the ability of patients to perform everyday activities. Patients with dementia tend to experience episodes of anxiety and remain for extended periods, which affects their quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To design AnxiDetector, a system capable of detecting patterns of sounds associated before and during the manifestation of anxiety in patients with dementia. METHODS: We conducted a non-participatory observation of 70 diagnosed patients in-situ, and conducted semi-structured interviews with four caregivers at a residential centre. Using the findings from our observation and caregiver interviews, we developed the AnxiDetector prototype and tested this in an experimental setting where we defined nine classes of audio to represent two groups of sounds: (i) Disturbance which includes audio files that characterise sounds that trigger anxiety in patients with dementia, and (ii) Expression which includes audio files that characterise sounds expressed by the patients during episodes of anxiety. We conducted two experimental classifications of sounds using (i) a Neural Network model trained and (ii) a Support Vector Machine model. The first evaluation consists of a binary discriminating between the two groups of sounds; the second evaluation discriminates the nine classes of audio. The audio resources were retrieved from publicly available datasets. RESULTS: The qualitative results present the views of the caregivers on the adoption of AnxiDetector. The quantitative results from our binary discrimination show a classification accuracy of 98.1% and 99.2% for the Deep Neural Network and Support Vector Machine models, respectively. When classifying the nine classes of sound, our model shows a classification accuracy of 92.2%. Whereas, the Support Vector Machine model yielded an overall classification accuracy of 93.0%. CONCLUSION: In this paper, we presented the outcomes from an observational study in-site at a residential care centre, qualitative findings from interviews with caregivers, the design of AnxiDetector, and preliminary qualitative results of a methodology devised to detect relevant acoustic events associated with anxiety in patients with dementia. We conclude by signalling future plans to conduct in-situ validation of the effectiveness of AnxiDetector for anxiety detection.",60112876,"AudEERING GmbH, Gilching",Gilching,Germany,['1701'],24.714285714285715,0.0625,0.35989583333333336,1
246,246,Iterative block ciphers from tweakable block ciphers with long tweaks," All rights reserved.We consider a problem of constructing a secure block cipher from a tweakable block cipher (TBC) with long tweaks. Given a TBC with n-bit blocks and τn-bit tweaks for τ ≥ 1, one of the constructions by Minematsu in DCC 2015 shows that a simple iteration of the TBC for 3d rounds yields a block cipher with dn-bit blocks that is secure up to 2dn/2 queries, where d = τ + 1. In this paper, we show three results. 1. Iteration of 3d − 2 rounds is enough for the security up to 2dn/2 queries, i.e., the security remains the same even if we reduce the number of rounds by two. 2. When the number of queries is limited to 2n, d + 1 rounds are enough, and with d + ℓ rounds for 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ d − 1, the security bound improves as ℓ grows. 3. A d-round construction gives a block cipher secure up to 2n/2 queries, i.e., it achieves the classical birthday-bound security. Our results show that a block cipher with beyond-birthday-bound (BBB) security (with respect to n) is obtained as low as d + 1 rounds, and we draw the security spectrum of d + ℓ round version in the range of 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ d − 1 and ℓ = 2d − 2 for BBB security, and ℓ = 0 for birthday-bound security.",60000264,Nagoya University,Nagoya,Japan,"['1712', '1706']",23.4,0.07321428571428573,0.3770833333333334,0

253,253,Learning trajectories as words: A probabilistic generative model for destination prediction,"Destination prediction is crucial for many location based services such as sightseeing places recommendation and targeted advertisements push. Most existing techniques utilize the historical trajectories to predict destinations, but they fail to well describe the spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories and suffer the trajectory sparsity problem, i.e., the available historical trajectories are hard to cover all probable trajectories. The temporal sensitivity of historical trajectories highlights the sparsity problem even more. In this paper, we address this problem by building a probabilistic generative model to capture the spatio-temporal features of trajectories. We develop an extended Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to characterize the generative mechanism of track points in each trajectory. In this model, trajectory, track point of trajectory and destination are regarded as document, word and response respectively. To address the trajectory sparsity problem, each trajectory is expressed by the distribution of trajectory patterns which are the topics discovered from historical trajectories. Then, the most likely destination is predicted through the trajectory patterns. The experiments performed on a real-world taxi trajectory dataset from Guangzhou confirm the advantage of the probabilistic generative model in destination prediction, achieving remarkable accuracy and strong interpretability.",60021182,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.11111111111111,0.1642156862745098,0.43088235294117644,1
254,254,MultiLock: Biometric-based graded authentication for mobile devices,"While traditionally smartphones have relied on methods such as a passcode or pattern-based authentication, biometric authentication techniques are gaining popularity. However current biometric methods are heavily dependent on various environmental factors. For example, face authentication methods depend on lighting conditions, camera shake and picture framing, while fingerprint scanning relies on finger placement. All of these variables can result in these systems becoming time-consuming for the user to use. To remedy these problems, we propose MultiLock, a passive, graded authentication system, which uses face authentication as a case study to propose a system that gives users access to their devices without requiring them to manually interact with the lock screen. MultiLock allows a user to categorize applications into various security bins based on their sensitivity. By doing so MultiLock can grant users access to different sensitivity applications, based on varying degrees of sureness that the device is being used by its rightful owner. Thus, allowing the device to be used even in adverse lighting conditions without hampering user experience. In our tests, MultiLock was able to grant access to users for 88% of the interactions on average, while passively running in the background. While we use face authentication as an example to demonstrate and propose MultiLock, our system can be used with any confidence based biometric system.",60014439,"University of California, Davis",Davis,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.6,0.06,0.5625,1

Instead of performing the validation of the system outputs in a single step, as it is customary, the proposed methodology envisaged a multi-step validation process to be embedded into a human-in-the-loop approach. At each step, the system outputs are validated and, whenever an image word that does not correspond to any entry of the keyword list is mistakenly returned by the system, its correct transcription is entered and used to query the system in the next step. The performance of our approach has been experimentally evaluated in terms of the total time to achieve the complete transcription of a subset of documents from the Bentham dataset. The results confirm that interleaving keyword spotting by the system and validation by the user leads to a significant reduction of the time required to transcribe the document content with respect to both the manual transcription and the traditional end-of-the-loop validation process.",60007061,Università di Salerno,Salerno,Italy,['1707'],35.0,0.05595238095238095,0.3765873015873016,1

The scope of our study is restricted to two university hospitals: HUC Habib Thameur considered as pilot institution and the University Hospital Charles Nicolle. We have identified the ""hospitalized patient pathway with additional acts"" process as a typical process for conducting this study. The objective of this paper is to propose a quality assurance approach for automating and managing hospital business processes. This is to show how to build a framework for an existing process in order to evaluate it and analyse it. In particular, we are looking into identifying the process's operational limits, its malfunctioning and shortcoming, its degree of ICT integration and finally we are interested in evaluating the process's quality when deployed on different health care sites. It is in this sense that we propose, in this work, to put in place an approach for managing hospital business processes. This approach contributes first to ensuring reliable monitoring of the processes by obtaining an overview of each one. Second, it helps to precisely measure the minimum and maximum duration of execution of the process. Third, we also aim to identify the formal and informal actors involved and validate their commitment and expertise with relation to the implementation of the process.

There is particular interest in the capability of sensing subcellular changes of magnetic and electrical fields, temperature, and pressure. However, the sensitivity of such nanodiamond particles with NV centre as a probe is highly dependent on the relative location and polarisation of the NV centre to the bulk of the particle.

The scattering fields are obtained by using the recently developed robust non-singular surface integral equation method.1, 2 Our results highlight a new pathway to nanodiamond characterisation which may be useful in teasing out the various effects of surface morphology, surface termination, and formation details, which ultimately may benefit the optimisation of diamond production for nanoscale biosensing applications.",60011362,RMIT University,Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],31.8,0.11254820936639119,0.4479889807162534,0

264,264,Who will save the internet from the congestion control revolution?," Publication rights licensed to ACM.Active queue management (AQM) techniques have evolved in the recent years, after defining the bufferbloat problem. In parallel novel congestion control (CC) algorithms have been developed to achieve better data transport performance, often assuming simple tail dropping buffers. On the other hand, AQM algorithms usually assume legacy CC (Cubic). Though all of the novel AQM and CC algorithms improve the performance under these assumptions, their co-existence has not or only partially been tested so far. Similarly, router buffer sizing was studied mainly in the 2000s, also assuming traditional CC and tail dropping buffers. In this paper we show that combining the different AQMs and CCs evolved in the past few years results in poor fairness, because assumptions used during development do not hold in this heterogeneous case. We also show that while a non-traditional AQM, using core-stateless resource sharing control, has the potential to harmonize conflicting CCs, it suffers from deployment issues. We argue that when dimensioning router buffers in networks where connections with different CCs coexist, the right choice of AQM is more important than the size of the buffer itself.",60080668,Ericsson Hungary Ltd.,Budapest,Hungary,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",23.375,0.0055383022774327115,0.5087474120082816,0

267,267,Hiding security feature into text content for securing documents using generated font,"Motivated by increasing possibility of the tampering of genuine documents during a transmission over digital channels, we focus on developing a watermarking framework for determining whether a given document is genuine or falsified. The proposed framework is performed by hiding a security feature or secret information within the document. In order to hide the security feature, we replace the appropriate characters of legal document by the equivalent characters coming from generated fonts, called hereafter the variations of characters. These variations are produced by training generative adversarial networks (GAN) with the features of character's skeleton and normal shape. Regarding the process of detecting hidden information, we make use of fully convolutional networks (FCN) to produce salient regions from the watermarked document. The salient regions mark positions of document where the characters are substituted by their variations, and these positions are used as a reference for extracting the hidden information. Lastly, we demonstrate that our approach gives high precision of data detection, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",60122452,"Laboratoire Informatique, Image et Interaction",La Rochelle,France,['1707'],23.857142857142858,0.09787878787878788,0.3930303030303031,1
268,268,A practitioner's guide to process mining: Limitations of the directly-follows graph," Published by Elsevier B.V.Process mining techniques use event data to show what people, machines, and organizations are really doing. Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify and address performance and compliance problems. In recent years, the adoption of process mining in practice increased rapidly. It is interesting to see how ideas first developed in open-source tools like ProM, get transferred to the dozens of available commercial process mining tools. However, these tools still resort to producing Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs) based on event data rather than using more sophisticated notations also able to capture concurrency. Moreover, to tackle complexity, DFGs are seamlessly simplified by removing nodes and edges based on frequency thresholds. Process-mining practitioners tend to use such simplified DFGs actively. Despite their simplicity, these DFGs may be misleading and users need to know how these process models are generated before interpreting them. In this paper, we discuss the pitfalls of using simple DFGs generated by commercial tools. Practitioners conducting a process-mining project need to understand the risks associated with the (incorrect) use of DFGs and frequency-based simplification. Therefore, we put these risks in the spotlight.",60016653,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Aachen,Germany,['1700'],17.272727272727273,0.19444444444444448,0.37769841269841264,0

In a rapidly changing environment like the present one, there are many factors that contribute to budget overruns and delays that occur in most major projects. To be successful, one must rely on techniques and tools that assist the project manager in the various stages of the project. Therefore, this paper presents an Add-In for MS Project®, based on a previously developed model for solving the Resource Constraint Project Scheduling Problem with Flexible Resource Management (RCPSP-FRM), which can help the project manager with regard to the scheduling of resources using flexibility, giving him relevant information to the decision making process in case of delays during the execution phase. The flexible chart and table format view allows project managers to easily and objectively identify the activities which can have their durations increased or shortened, impacting significantly on project execution time.

270,270,An intelligent optimization method for information recommendation,"Accurate information recommendation to users can significantly improve the service efficiency of recommendation platforms, and improve users' experience of the client. With the rapid development of the internet, information recommendation platforms such as e-commerce are facing problems of data sparsity or algorithms are difficult to deal with large-scale calculation, which cause the recommended information cannot meet the needs of users. In order to improve the accuracy of information recommendation, the need of users is regarded as the evaluation basis of information recommendation, and an intelligent optimization method for information recommendation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, Resource Evaluation, User Evaluation and Scenario Evaluation are taken as main factors of information recommendation, and each evaluation algorithm for every factor is designed. Then, the weight of each factor is optimally allocated by the adaptive genetic algorithm. Finally, the multiplication of the quantized value of each factor and its weight is accumulated to get the comprehensive evaluation result, which is compared with the threshold value to decide whether to recommend the information to the user. Taking the e-commerce platform as an example, simulation results show that the intelligent optimization method for information recommendation proposed in this paper is effective and can significantly improve both accuracy and precision of information recommendation.",60052453,Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",29.571428571428573,0.296969696969697,0.7409090909090907,1

Specifically, we alter the architecture of a convolutional network with global average pooling to include variance pooling as well, we utilize score calibration of the output scores of the network, and we utilize prior distribution estimation to condition the calibrated scores. We show that these methods are effective in script identification, with the use of priors showing especially promising improvements. Furthermore, in the domain of script identification, several additional extensions of distribution estimation are available which consider the distribution within each image, and we demonstrate much larger improvements when employing these extensions. Finally, we also show that an embedding-plus-classifier approach performs similarly to the full network, and so its potential for increased flexibility may be beneficial for future consideration.

The database was built by annotating 11,937 pages of Chinese ancient handwritten documents. It consists of more than 2.2 million annotated handwritten character samples of 10,350 categories. According to the source of these documents, the database is divided into two datasets of different styles: Complete Library in Four Sections (AHCDB-style1) and Ancient Buddhist Scriptures (AHCDB-style2). Each dataset can be divided into three parts based on its applications. The first part, called basic category set, contains samples of common categories in two datasets, and is suitable for basic character recognition task. The second part, called enhanced category set, is mainly used for open-set character recognition task based on the basic character recognition. The third part, called the reserved category set, can be used in many pattern recognition tasks in the future. Based on the large category set, the various writing styles and the imbalanced sample number per category, CASIA-AHCDB can also be used for various classification and learning tasks such as transfer learning, few-shot learning.

273,273,Fim: Spatio temporal feature based human activity recognition using moving object detection and classification," All rights reserved.One of the drastically growing and emerging research in recent days is video surveillance. Object detection and tracking is a challenging task in the surveillance video. Detecting and identifying an abnormal event in a video is a security application used in various emerging industries like military, airport, remote surveillance and etc. Tracking an object in a video based on the time is a challenging task in video processing. In earlier research works, video processing tools have been developed for video processing. Software tools detect the position of the objects in the image and segment the objects. The objects are detected using boundaries. But the boundary-based object detection is not highly accurate. Considering this problem, this paper motivated to improve the accuracy of the object detection and classification. To do this, this paper proposed a novel Feature Incorporation Model (FIM) for improving the object detection and activity recognition. FIM used spatio temporal feature process using Convolutional Neural Network and Multiclass Support Vector Machine for classification. The proposed approach is experimented and tested over UCF and KTH benchmark datasets. The performance of the FIM is evaluated by comparing with the detection and classification accuracy with the state-of-the-art methods.

274,274,Higher order correlation scaling for optical super-resolution imaging: Implications of photon counting and quantum imaging for practical nanoscopy," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Techniques of optical superresolution imaging are vital for uncovering the complex dynamics of biochemistry in cellular environments. However the practical resolution for superresolution imaging is limited by the increased photon budget for superresolution, compared with conventional microscopy. For this reason it is important to determine the optimal methods for analysing all of the incoming information. Most approaches to microscopy use only the wave-like properties of light, but the particle-like nature of light provides extra information that is normally inaccessible and can be used to increase imaging resolution. Here we theoretically study the localisation of quantum emitters using higher-order quantum correlation functions to understand the resolution that is practically achievable for bio-imaging tasks. We show explicit imaging results for varying number of emitters as a function of correlation order to illustrate the necessary tradeoffs between imaging resolution and acquisition time.",60011362,RMIT University,Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],24.833333333333332,0.10255102040816326,0.525,0
275,275,AugToAct: Scaling complex human activity recognition with few labels,"Human activity recognition (HAR) from wearable sensor data has recently gained widespread adoption in a number of fields. However, recognizing complex human activities, postural and rhythmic body movements (e.g. dance, sports) is challenging due to the lack of domain-specific labeling information, the perpetual variability in human movement kinematics profiles due to age, sex, dexterity and the level of professional training. In this paper, we propose a deep activity recognition model to work with limited labeled data, both for simple and complex human activities. To mitigate the intra and inter-user spatio-temporal variability of movements, we posit novel data augmentation and domain normalization techniques. We depict a semi-supervised technique that learns noise and transformation invariant feature representation from sparsely labeled data to accommodate intra-personal and inter-user variations of human movement kinematics. We also postulate a transfer learning approach to learn domain invariant feature representations by minimizing the feature distribution distance between the source and target domains. We showcase the improved performance of our proposed framework, AugToAct, using a public HAR dataset. We also design our own data collection, annotation and experimental setup on complex dance activity recognition steps and kinematics movements where we achieved higher performance metrics with limited label data compared to simple activity recognition tasks.",60138835,Expedia Group,Seattle,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.77777777777778,0.011688311688311687,0.32575757575757575,1
276,276,Efficient side-channel secure message authentication with better bounds," All rights reserved.We investigate constructing message authentication schemes from symmetric cryptographic primitives, with the goal of achieving security when most intermediate values during tag computation and verification are leaked (i.e., mode-level leakage-resilience). Existing efficient proposals typically follow the plain Hash-then-MAC paradigm T = TGenK(H(M)). When the domain of the MAC function TGenK is {0, 1}128, e.g., when instantiated with the AES, forgery is possible within time 264 and data complexity 1. To dismiss such cheap attacks, we propose two modes: LRW1-based Hash-then-MAC (LRWHM) that is built upon the LRW1 tweakable blockcipher of Liskov, Rivest, and Wagner, and Rekeying Hash-then-MAC (RHM) that employs internal rekeying. Built upon secure AES implementations, LRWHM is provably secure up to (beyond-birthday) 278.3 time complexity, while RHM is provably secure up to 2121 time. Thus in practice, their main security threat is expected to be side-channel key recovery attacks against the AES implementations.

278,278,Text line adjustment based on neural network,"With the development of artificial intelligence technology, many text generation models have emerged. People generate single words in various ways. For example, different forms of English characters and numbers can be generated through Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Then, text lines can be synthesized from single words. However, most people only use some well-defined rules to synthesize 'text line' from 'single word'. The result depends on people's experience. Therefore, the generated text lines often seem inconsistent, especially when generating handwriting text line. For example, it's hard to make the adjacent parts of the text look real. Moreover, adjacent words may have different styles. These problems can not be solved by simply modifying the text synthesis program. In this paper, we attempts to use neural networks to adjust the synthesized text lines. The input of our model is a synthetic text line, and then it can output a more coordinated text line. Four different loss and a discriminator ensure the quality of the generated text lines. In experiments, our neural network has successfully corrected many unnatural aspects of synthetic text lines.

281,281,Impact of consensus on appendable-block blockchain for IoT,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming our physical world into a complex and dynamic system of connected devices on an unprecedented scale. Connecting everyday physical objects is creating new business models, improving processes and reducing costs and risks. Recently, blockchain technology has received a lot of attention from the community as a possible solution to overcome security issues in IoT. However, traditional blockchains (such as the ones used in Bitcoin and Ethereum) are not well suited to the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices and also with the large volume of information that is expected to be generated from typical IoT deployments. To overcome these issues, several researchers have presented lightweight instances of blockchains tailored for IoT. For example, proposing novel data structures based on blocks with decoupled and appendable data. However, these researchers did not discuss how the consensus algorithm would impact their solutions, i.e., the decision of which consensus algorithm would be better suited was left as an open issue. In this paper, we improved an appendable-block blockchain framework to support different consensus algorithms through a modular design. We evaluated the performance of this improved version in different emulated scenarios and studied the impact of varying the number of devices and transactions and employing different consensus algorithms. Even adopting different consensus algorithms, results indicate that the latency to append a new block is less than 161ms (in the more demanding scenario) and the delay for processing a new transaction is less than 7ms, suggesting that our improved version of the appendable-block blockchain is efficient and scalable, and thus well suited for IoT scenarios.",60028333,University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia,Sydney,Australia,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",26.5,0.041606541606541605,0.4288119288119288,1

In this paper, we attempt to achieve document image quality assessment and our contributions are twofold. Firstly, since document image quality assessment is more interested in text, we propose a text line based framework to estimate document image quality, which is composed of three stages: text line detection, text line quality prediction, and overall quality assessment. Text line detection aims to find potential text lines with a detector. In the text line quality prediction stage, the quality score is computed for each text line with a CNN-based prediction model. The overall quality of document images is finally assessed with the ensemble of all text line quality. Secondly, to train the prediction model, a large-scale dataset, comprising 52,094 text line images, is synthesized with diverse attributes. For each text line image, a quality label is computed with a piecewise function.

The fundus images undergo intensity adjustment and bilateral filter it is then followed by optic disc extraction and Superpixel segmentation using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering. Features, such as Intensity-based statistics and Texton-map Histogram, are extracted and normalized. The resulting values are classified by various Machine Learning algorithms as positive or negative for AMD.

291,291,Identifying the central figure of a scientific paper,"Publishers are increasingly using graphical abstracts to facilitate scientific search, especially across disciplinary boundaries. They are presented on various media, easily shared and information rich. However, very small amount of scientific publications are equipped with graphical abstracts. What can we do with the vast majority of papers with no selected graphical abstract? In this paper, we first hypothesize that scientific papers actually include a 'central figure' that serve as a graphical abstract. These figures convey the key results and provide a visual identity for the paper. Using survey data collected from 6,263 authors regarding 8,353 papers over 15 years, we find that over 87% of papers are considered to contain a central figure, and that these central figures are primarily used to summarize important results, explain the key methods, or provide additional discussion. We then train a model to automatically recognize the central figure, achieving top-3 accuracy of 78% and exact match accuracy of 34%. We find that the primary boost in accuracy comes from figure captions that resemble the abstract. We make all our data and results publicly available at https://github.com/viziometrics/centraul-figure.

292,292,Cascading modular U-nets for document image binarization,"In recent years, U-Net has achieved good results in various image processing tasks. However, conventional U-Nets need to be re-trained for individual tasks with enough amount of images with ground-truth. This requirement makes U-Net not applicable to tasks with small amounts of data. In this paper, we propose to use 'modular' U-Nets, each of which is pre-trained to perform an existing image processing task, such as dilation, erosion, and histogram equalization. Then, to accomplish a specific image processing task, such as binarization of historical document images, the modular U-Nets are cascaded with inter-module skip connections and fine-tuned to the target task.

It is an important phase of software life cycle. When requirements are poorly defined, then it leads to various problems like system failure, delays, and cost overruns. Complexity of the system makes requirements more important and increases the chance of risk in requirements. Model driven approach enhances the understanding of the system in effective way as it contains the models, which is the main artifact during software system development. This paper proposes a model driven approach for defining the requirements with their related risk in efficient way. It helps in understanding the stakeholders who play an important role in development of the software system.

Inspired by the natural image captioning problem in computer vision, we present a mathematical equation description (MED) model, a novel end-to-end trainable deep neural network based approach that learns to generate a textual description for reading mathematical equation images. Our MED model consists of a convolution neural network as an encoder that extracts features of input mathematical equation images and a recurrent neural network with attention mechanism which generates description related to the input mathematical equation images. Due to the unavailability of mathematical equation image data sets with their textual descriptions, we generate two data sets for experimental purpose.

By connecting starting point, nodes, and ending point, multi alternative practical routes which are not in collision with obstacles can be acquired. Secondly, this paper tries to optimize a route by eliminating unnecessary nodes and repositioning the nodes between starting point and ending point.

299,299,TextEdge: Multi-oriented scene text detection via region segmentation and edge classification,"The semantic-segmentation-based scene text detection algorithms always use the bounding-box regions or their shrinks to represent the text pixels. However, the non-text pixel information in these regions easily results in the poor performance of text detection, because these semantic segmentation methods need accurate pixel-level annotated training data to achieve approving performance and they are sensitive to noise and interference. In this work, we propose a fully convolutional network (FCN) based method termed TextEdge for multi-oriented scene text detection. Compared with previous methods simply using bounding-box regions as a segmentation mask, TextEdge introduces the text-region edge map as a new segmentation mask. Edge information is more representative for text areas and is proved to be effective in improving detection performance. TextEdge is optimized in an end-to-end way with multi-task outputs: text and non-text classification, text-edge prediction and the text boundaries regression. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

301,301,Document domain adaptation with generative adversarial networks,"Despite the digitization of communication flows, information is still commonly exchanged via printed documents. Since manual information extraction becomes inefficient and prone to errors, automatic document processing (ADP) tools have been proposed. Following the current trends in machine learning, many of these tools are based on deep learning methods which require a representative set of training documents to achieve good performance for a target domain. In practice, training documents are often scarce and limited to certain domains which makes it difficult to train a model that generalises well to varying domains. This paper analyses the influence of domain shifts on the performance of document analysis tasks. It further explores the improvements that can be achieved with visual domain adaptation using generative adversarial networks (GANs). The results show that the impact of the domain shift on the performance is not only depending on the difference between the domains but also on the analysis task itself. While some tasks such as document binarization are noticeably affected by the domain shift, other tasks like page classification are less sensitive. It is also shown that the use of mapped training data obtained from a GAN, which translates between the source and target domain, can improve the performance considerably.",60002483,Universiteit van Amsterdam,Amsterdam,Netherlands,['1707'],22.666666666666668,0.02654061624649859,0.4709383753501401,1

This interaction leads to ambiguous cases for which recognition systems often over-or sub-segment baselines. The interest of our method is to combine contextual and structural knowledge in order to interpret properly this interaction. Our combination is able to merge heterogeneous information obtained with a deep-learning approach (for contextual elements) and a syntactical approach (for structural elements). Our grammatical description consists on a logical description of the intersections between text-lines and vertical rulings of detected tables. Intersections are described thanks to physical indicators extracted from images: vertical rulings, hypothetical text-lines, begin-and end-indicators of text-lines. We show on cBAD competition [4] (competition on baseline detection) that the combination of heterogeneous knowledge (structural and contextual information) improves baseline detection in handwritten documents.

While in the classification part, a multinomial classifier is trained along with the generator in the form of a game to achieve better character recognition performance. That is, the proposed GARN has the ability to augment scene character data by its generation part and recognize scene characters by its classification part. It is trained in an adversarial way to improve recognition performance.

313,313,Target-directed mixup for labeling tangut characters,"Deep learning largely improves the performance in computer vision and image understanding tasks depending on large training datasets of labeled images. However, it is usually expensive and time-consuming to label data although unlabeled data are much easier to get. It is practical to build the training dataset iteratively from a small set of manually labeled data because of the limited budget or emerging new categories. The labeled data could not only be used for training the model but also some knowledge could be mined from them for finding examples of the classes not included in the training dataset. Mixup [1] improves the model's accuracy and generalization by augmenting the training dataset with the 'virtual examples' that are generated by mixing pairs of randomly selected examples from the training dataset. Motivated by Mixup, we propose the Target-Directed Mixup (TDM) method for building the training dataset of the deep learning-based Tangut character recognition system. The virtual examples are generated by mixing two or more similar examples in the training dataset, together with the target examples of unseen classes that need to be labeled, which is a kind of generative few-shot learning. This method can help expand the training dataset by finding real examples of unseen Tangut characters and provide virtual examples that could represent the rare characters that are used very limited in historical documents. According to our experiments, TDM can help recognize the unseen examples at the accuracy of 80% with only 4 to 5 real target examples, which largely reduces human labor in data annotation.",60018308,Xi'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an,China,['1707'],28.333333333333332,0.06204250295159386,0.4576741440377804,1

Most existing deep learning methods consist of two stages, i.e., training a text recognition network on the base of visual information, followed by incorporating language constrains with various language models. Therefore, the inherent linguistic semantic information is often neglected when designing the recognition network. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-level multimodal fusion network and properly embed it into an attention-based LSTM so that both the visual information and the linguistic semantic information can be fully leveraged when predicting sequential outputs from the feature vectors.

318,318,HoughNet: Neural network architecture for vanishing points detection,"In this paper we introduce a novel neural network architecture based on Fast Hough Transform layer. The layer of this type allows our neural network to accumulate features from linear areas across the entire image instead of local areas. We demonstrate its potential by solving the problem of vanishing points detection in the images of documents. Such problem occurs when dealing with camera shots of the documents in uncontrolled conditions. In this case, the document image can suffer several specific distortions including projective transform. To train our model, we use MIDV-500 dataset and provide testing results. Strong generalization ability of the suggested method is proven with its applying to a completely different ICDAR 2011 dewarping contest.

It is mostly because new solutions using neural networks show state-of-the-art results in the domains previously occupied by traditional methods, eg. computer vision, speech recognition etc. But to get these results neural networks become progressively more complex, thus needing a lot more training. The training of neural networks today can take weeks. This problems can be solved by parallelization of the neural networks training and using modern clusters and supercomputers, which can significantly reduce the learning time. Today, a faster training for data scientist is essential, because it allows to get the results faster to make the next decision.

A care label, also called a care tag, is a small piece of cloth or paper attached to a garment providing instructions for its maintenance and information about e.g. the material and size. The informationand instructions are written as symbols or plain text. Care label recognition is a challenging text and pictogram recognition problem-the often sewn text is small, looking as if printed using a non-standard font; the contrast of the text gradually fades, making OCR progressively more difficult. On the other hand, the information provided is typically redundant and thus it facilitates semi-supervised learning. The presented care label recognition method is based on the recently published End-to-End Method for Multi-LanguageScene Text, E2E-MLT, Busta et al. 2018, exploiting specific constraints, e.g. a care label vocabulary with multi-language equivalences. Experiments conducted on a newly-created dataset of 63 care label images show that even when exploiting problem-specific constraints, a state-of-the-art scene text detection and recognition method achieve precision and recall slightly above 0.6, confirming the challenging nature of the problem.",60013323,Ceské vysoké ucení technické v Praze,Prague,Czech Republic,['1707'],18.3,-0.003273809523809531,0.475595238095238,1
323,323,Learning free document image binarization based on fast fuzzy C-means clustering,"In this paper, a novel local threshold binarization method using fast Fuzzy C-Means clustering is proposed. Historical document images with non-uniform background, stains, faded ink are first processed by removing the background using inpainting based method. Then using Fuzzy C-Means clustering is used to cluster out the pixels into three main clusters: sure text pixels, sure background pixels and confused pixels which may or may not be labeled as text. Based on the structural symmetry of pixels (SSP), these confused pixels are then classified into text or background pixels. The SSP is defined as those pixels around strokes whose gradient magnitudes are big enough and whose directions are opposite. As the gradient map is our basis for computing the SSP, we further propose to estimate the background surface first and to extract potential SSP in the compensated image so as to deal with degradations of document images such as uneven illumination, low contrast and stain. To prove the effectiveness of our method, tests on eight public document image datasets are preformed and the experimental results show that our method outperforms other local threshold binarization approaches on both F-measure and PSNR.",60013717,Université de La Rochelle,La Rochelle,France,['1707'],27.142857142857142,0.03825757575757577,0.39633838383838377,1

328,328,Exploration of CNN features for online handwriting recognition,"Recently, convolution neural network (CNN) has demonstrated its powerful ability in learning features particularly from image data. In this work, its capability of feature learning in online handwriting is explored, by constructing various CNN architectures. The developed CNNs can process online handwriting directly unlike the existing works that convert the online handwriting to an image to utilize the architecture. The first convolution layer accepts the sequence of (x; y) coordinates along the trace of the character as an input and outputs a convolved filtered signal. Thereafter, via alternating steps of convolution and Rectified Linear Unit layers, in a hierarchical fashion, we obtain a set of deep features that can be employed for classification. We utilize the proposed CNN features to develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based character recognition system and an implicit-segmentation based large vocabulary word recognition system employing hidden Markov model (HMM) framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of its kind that applies CNN directly on the (x; y) coordinates of the online handwriting data.

The stereo system acquires a set of pairs of images, at different zooming levels, making it possible to obtain an affine calibration. The latter is obtained by taking advantage of the translation motion of the principal plane of each zooming camera. In particular, each pair of zoom images provides a pair of parallel planes that intersect at infinity. This makes it possible to estimate the principal point of each camera.

This study employs Data Envelopment Analysis to measure the productivity scores (Malmquist Productivity Index) of insurers and uses panel regression model to investigate the impacts of globalization on the productivity of insurers. It also examines the sources of productivity between non-life insurers and life insurers. The findings demonstrate that the main source of productivity progression is technological change. Life insurers demonstrate better productivity improvement than non-life insurers is mainly accredited to technological change.

342,342,Curved text detection in natural scene images with semi-and weakly-supervised learning,"Detecting curved text in the wild is very challenging. Recently, most state-of-the-art methods are segmentation based and require pixel-level annotations. We propose a novel scheme to train an accurate text detector using only a small amount of pixel-level annotated data and a large amount of data annotated with rectangles or even unlabeled data. A light model is first obtained by training with the pixel-level annotated data and then used to annotate unlabeled or weakly labeled data. A novel strategy which utilizes ground-truth bounding boxes to generate pseudo mask annotations is proposed in weakly-supervised learning. Experimental results on CTW1500 and Total-Text demonstrate that our method can substantially reduce the requirement of pixel-level annotated data. Our method can also generalize well across the two datasets.

343,343,End-to-end measure for text recognition,"Measuring the performance of text recognition and text line detection engines is an important step to objectively compare systems and their configuration. There exist well-established measures for both tasks separately. However, there is no sophisticated evaluation scheme to measure the quality of a combined text line detection and text recognition system. The F-measure on word level is a well-known methodology, which is sometimes used in this context. Nevertheless, it does not take into account the alignment of hypothesis and ground truth text and can lead to deceptive results. Since users of automatic information retrieval pipelines in the context of text recognition are mainly interested in the end-to-end performance of a given system, there is a strong need for such a measure. Hence, we present a measure to evaluate the quality of an end-to-end text recognition system. The basis for this measure is the well established and widely used character error rate, which is limited-in its original form-to aligned hypothesis and ground truth texts. The proposed measure is flexible in a way that it can be configured to penalize different reading orders between the hypothesis and ground truth and can take into account the geometric position of the text lines. Additionally, it can ignore over-and under-segmentation of text lines. With these parameters it is possible to get a measure fitting best to its own needs.",60003615,Universität Rostock,Rostock,Germany,['1707'],20.363636363636363,0.22916666666666669,0.5988095238095238,1
344,344,Structured back focal plane interferometry (S-BFPI)," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.In optical micromanipulation, back focal plane interferometry (BFPI) has remained the most widely used method for tracking dielectric and metallic microparticles with nanometer resolution precision at speeds of up to few a MHz. Basic BFPI employs Gaussian beams which severely limits the detection range of the technique unless the focal parameters are tuned by increase the width of the beam, but this is usually concomitant with significant loss in detection sensitivity. A challenge in BFPI is to extend its linear range while maintaining this detection sensitivity along each axis. We constructed a system which utilizes a combination of structured beam shaping and structured detection (Annular Quadrant Detection), which we called Structured Back Focal Plane Interferometry (S-BFPI). A Gaussian beam is shaped by a spatial light modulator by imparting a conical wavefront, which increases the depth of focus while simultaneously maintaining the Gouy phase shift and hence the sensitivity of detection. In addition, an annular QPD is used for detection. Using S-BFPI, we were able to achieve a 200% axial range extension with only a 4.6% reduction in insensitivity, and a 167% lateral range extension with a 45% reduction in sensitivity. SBFPI can tailor its detection range and sensitivity over an intermediate range of displacement and sensitivity improvements at hand. We finally demonstrated its robustness against aberrations common to optical systems.

345,345,Bi-level masked multi-scale CNN-RNN networks for short text representation,"Representing short text is becoming extremely important for a variety of valuable applications. However, representing short text is critical yet challenging because it involves lots of informal words and typos (i.e. the noise problem) but only few vocabularies in each text (i.e. the sparsity problem). Most of existing work on representing short text relies on noise recognition and sparsity expansion. However, the noises in short text are with various forms and changing fast, but, most of the current methods may fail to adaptively recognize the noise. Also, it is hard to explicitly expand a sparse text to a high-quality dense text. In this paper, we tackle the noise and sparsity problems in short text representation by learning multi-grain noise-tolerant patterns and then embedding the most significant patterns in a text as its representation. To achieve this goal, we propose a bi-level multi-scale masked CNN-RNN network to embed the most significant multi-grain noise-tolerant relations among words and characters in a text into a dense vector space. Comprehensive experiments on five large real-world data sets demonstrate our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.",60023932,University of Technology Sydney,Sydney,Australia,['1707'],18.1,0.16240079365079366,0.5685515873015873,1

It contributes to improve the accuracy of the systems. Several researches have been done to increase the accuracy, however there are still several remaining issues which require enhancement of segmentation method. In this research, the focus is to improve accuracy of segmentation method for rotated iris image. The current accuracy rate for the segmentation is around 94% and it must be improved. The proposed method in segmentation process utilized the integration of an optimized Hough integration of the optimized Hough circle transform with the integrodifferential operator enabled search for the iris location over a wider radii, detecting and localizing the iris region of the eye image by employing one center coordinates of the iris and pupil. This approach is found more effective in improving the accuracy of iris segmentation in rotated iris image. Evaluation was carried out at the end of the study using UBIRIS v2.0 Database and the approach achieved an overall recognition accuracy of 97.6%. The result of the experimental evaluation showed that the accuracy of the iris identification increased as compared to existing techniques.

352,352,Pushing smart caching to the edge with Baycache,"Caching contents in a small cell base station (SBS) is getting supported more and more widely today due to the Internet traffic growth and the requirement of low access latency. A primary concern and challenging issue with cache-enabled SBSs is how to better utilize network resources to achieve high overall performance. Though existing caching strategies can solve the problem to some extent, they are far from perfect - pure popularity-based ones usually lead to sub-optimal caching performance whereas global coordination ones suffer from extra cost of many control messages. To deal with the issue, we present an adaptive caching scheme based on Bayesian inference, which 1) identifies the traffic features over time for each SBS; 2) synthesizes various features to rank the contents via a Bayesian ranking model; and 3) does cache placement online according to the ranking results. Unlike existing approaches that only highlight some specific factor, our scheme, due to the adoption of a Bayesian approach, can easily support additional features of high impact on caching performance and measure them in a decentralized way within a single SBS. We evaluate our scheme under various circumstances in terms of SBSs density, cache size, content popularity and skewness. The results show that our solution using multiple features exhibits improved performance - it can reduce more than 30% the overall network latency in some cases when compared with solutions that only use a single feature.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",33.42857142857143,0.08455182072829132,0.4725560224089636,1

We propose an electro-optical detection system and show the recordings from an electrically stimulated in-vitro nerve preparation. The system converts the action potential at the probing position to light intensity before any amplification and detection. Thence the light signal is detected by a photodetector. The new detection system has the ability of isolating the probing point and the amplification circuits, which reduces the electrical interference from the circuit. Moreover, the sampled signal transmitted via optical fibres rather than cables or wires makes it more robust to environmental noise.

Various augmentations are applied to these synthesized images, and we compare the effect of each augmentation on the HCR results. Since we work on a collection of historical manuscripts, we can fit the model to the available test data. During training, our network has access to both the labeled synthetic training data and the unlabeled images of the test set, and we adapt and evaluate four different semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation approaches for transductive learning in HCR.

Telco historical data (e.g., MRs) have been widely analyzed to understand human mobility and optimize the applications such as urban planning and traffic forecasting. The key of these applications is to precisely localize outdoor mobile devices from these historical MR data. Previous works calculate the location of a mobile device based on each single MR sample, ignoring the sequential and temporal locality hidden in the consecutive MR samples. To address the issue, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based localization framework namely DeepLoc to ensemble a recently popular sequence learning model LSTM and a CNN.

Traditional machine learning approaches mainly focused on reducing dimensionality of textual data to perform classification.

Deep learning based text document classification, on the other hand, benefitted greatly from the invention of word embeddings that have solved the sparsity problem and researchers focus mainly remained on the development of deep architectures. Deeper architectures, however, learn some redundant features that limit the performance of deep learning based solutions. In this paper, we propose a two stage text document classification methodology which combines traditional feature engineering with automatic feature engineering (using deep learning). The proposed methodology comprises a filter based feature selection (FSE) algorithm followed by a deep convolutional neural network.

This trend creates challenges towards ensuring essential security for online shared data while maintaining the resource usage at a reasonable level. Existing research studies attempt to leverage compression based encryption for enabling such secure and fast data transmission replacing the traditional resource-heavy encryption schemes. Current compression-based encryption methods mainly focus on error insensitive digital data formats and prone to be vulnerable to different attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and implement a new Huffman compression based Encryption scheme using lightweight dynamic Order Statistic tree (HEliOS) for digital data transmission. The core idea of HEliOS involves around finding a secure encoding method based on a novel notion of Huffman coding, which compresses the given digital data using a small sized “secret"" (called as secret_intelligence in our study). HEliOS does this in such a way that, without the possession of the secret intelligence, an attacker will not be able to decode the encoded compressed data. Hence, by encrypting only the small-sized intelligence, we can secure the whole compressed data. Moreover, our rigorous real experimental evaluation for downloading and uploading digital data to and from a personal cloud storage Dropbox server validates efficacy and lightweight nature of HEliOS.",60021158,Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology,Dhaka,Bangladesh,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",23.0,0.05576951783848336,0.46456560680698605,1
368,368,Fast distributional smoothing for regularization in CTC applied to text recognition,"Many recent text recognition studies achieved successful performance by applying a sequential-label prediction framework such as connectionist temporal classification. Meanwhile, regularization is known to be essential to avoid overfitting when training deep neural networks. Regularization techniques that allow for semi-supervised learning have a greater impact than those that do not. Among widely researched single-label regularization techniques, virtual adversarial training (VAT) performs successfully by smoothing posterior distributions around training data points. However, VAT is almost solely applied to single-label prediction tasks, not to sequential-label prediction tasks. This is because the number of possible candidates in the label sequence exponentially increases with the sequence length, making it impractical to calculate posterior distributions and the divergence between them. Investigating this problem, we have found that there is an easily computable upper bound for divergence. Here, we propose fast distributional smoothing (FDS) as a method for drastically reducing computational costs by minimizing this upper bound. FDS allows regularization at practical computational costs in both supervised and semi-supervised learning. An experiment under simple settings confirmed that upper-bound minimization decreases divergence. Experiments also show that FDS improves scene text recognition performance and enhances state-of-the-art regularization performance. Furthermore, experiments show that FDS enables efficient semi-supervised learning in sequential-label prediction tasks and that it outperforms a conventional semi-supervised method.",60018735,Toshiba Corporation,Tokyo,Japan,['1707'],17.583333333333332,0.19355742296918765,0.5233893557422968,1

370,370,A spectral collocation method for coupled system of two dimensional abel integral equations of the second kind,"While the usual polynomial-based spectral collocation methods are capable of providing highly accurate simulation results for nonlinear integral equations with smooth solutions, its accuracy can be deleteriously degraded when the solutions exhibit locally singular behaviours. Recovering non-smooth solutions of nonlinear systems of weakly singular integral equations is a highly nontrivial task. Nonetheless, such problems arise in many applications of practical interest.

373,373,Determining the Threshold Values of Quality Metrics in BPMN Process Models Using Data Mining Techniques," Published by Elsevier B.V.The quality assessment of business process models based on the use of quality metrics is important and several questions arise regarding their threshold values. The goal of our research is to determine the threshold values for quality metrics to help modelers evaluate the quality of business process models. Then, the influence of the application domain on the threshold values in the quality metrics of the BPMN models is determined. For this purpose, we collected a set of good quality BPMN business process models from various sources. The calculation of quality metrics for this set of models is obtained automatically by adopting and extending a plugin developed in Java. Then, for determining the threshold values Data Mining is adopted. More precisely, we applied the clustering algorithm. To validate our results, we compared the threshold values found through our approach with the threshold values already published in literature. Moreover, we observed that the threshold values change according to the field of application. Thus, we applied the clustering algorithm separately for each domain, to find the threshold values classified by application domain.",60070316,Université de la Manouba,Manouba,Tunisia,['1700'],18.3,0.3,0.5285714285714286,0
374,374,DoT-Net: Document layout classification using texture-based CNN,"Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is a segmentation process that decomposes a scanned document image into its blocks of interest and classifies them. DLA is essential in a large number of applications, such as Information Retrieval, Machine Translation, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, and structured data extraction from documents. However, identification of document blocks in DLA is challenging due to variations of block locations, inter-and intra-class variability, and background noises. In this paper, we propose a novel texture-based convolutional neural network for document layout analysis, called DoT-Net. DoT-Net is a multiclass classifier that can effectively identify document component blocks such as text, image, table, mathematical expression, and line-diagram, whereas most related methods have focused on the text vs. non-text block classification problem. DoT-Net can capture textural variations among the multiclass regions of documents.

In this scheme, the user cache space is divided into three parts, and each cache space is equal probability random to cache the corresponding files in the file library segments, and the probability of caching different segments of the files is different. According to the dynamic change of the number of file requests, the segmentation criteria of the file library are updated accordingly, and the updating method adopts the percentage updating method. Only 20% of the files are filtered at a time and placed in the segment of the file library with the smallest hit probability. The simulation results show that SBRC-2DS has sufficient advantages in improving cache hit ratio compared with several existing classical cache strategies.",60005816,South China Normal University,Guangzhou,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",29.2,-0.05555555555555555,0.3648148148148148,1

For the above purpose, Text Siamese Network (TSN) is developed to automatically detect the keyframes which contain text in videos. Specifically, the TSN is composed of two branches, text similarity measurement and text identification. The first branch is utilized to evaluate the similarity between consecutive frames. Furthermore, an attention block is used to select the informative features to identify whether a frame contains text or not in the second branch. Additionally, a new dataset called VTKD2019 is proposed for video text keyframe detection. VTKD2019 contains 571 videos and is spit into three levels (easy, medium and hard) for evaluation.

We propose projection pooling as a novel component of the Split model and grid pooling as a novel part of the Merge model. While most Fully Convolutional Networks rely on local evidence, these unique pooling regions allow our models to take advantage of the global table structure.

380,380,Chemical structure recognition (CSR) system: Automatic analysis of 2D chemical structures in document images,"In this era of advanced technology and automation, information extraction has become a very common practice for the analysis of data. A technique known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used for recognition of text. The purpose is to extract textual data for automatic information analysis or natural language processing of document images. However, in the field of cheminformatics where it is required to recognize 2D molecular structures as they are published in research journals or patent documents, OCR is not adequate for processing, as chemical compounds can be represented both in textual as well as in graphical format. The digital representation of an image based chemical structure allows not only patent analysis teams to provide customize insights but also cheminformatic research groups to enhance their molecular structure databases, which further can be used for querying structure as well as sub-structural patterns. Some tools have been made for extraction and processing of image-based molecular structures. Optical Structure Recognition Application (OSRA) being one of the tools that partially fulfill the task of recognizing chemical structural in document images into chemical formats (SMILES, SDF, or MOL). However, it has few problems such as poor character recognition, false structure extraction, and slow processing. In this paper, we have developed a prototype Chemical Structure Recognition (CSR) system using modern and advanced image processing open-source libraries, which allows us to extract structural information of a chemical structure embedded in the form of a digital raster image. The CSR system is capable of processing chemical information contained in chemical structure image and generates the SMILES or MOL representation. For performance evaluation, we have used two different data sets to measure the potential of the CSR system. It yields better results than OSRA that depict accurate recognition, fast extraction, and correctness of great significance.",60075096,German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI),Kaiserslautern,Germany,['1707'],24.75,0.05597222222222223,0.486111111111111,1

Deep Learning techniques need large amount of data along with ground truth. Out of the available data, small portion of it has to be used for validation purpose as well. Preparing ground truth for historical documents is expensive and hence availability of data is of utmost concern. Jenckel et al. jenckel came up with an idea of using all the available data for training the OCR model and for the purpose of validation, they generated the input image from Softmax layer of the OCR model; using the decoder setup which can be used to compare with the original input image to validate the OCR model. In this paper, we have explored the possibilities of using Generative Adversial Networks (GANs) gan for generating the image directly from the text obtained from OCR model instead of using the Softmax layer which is not always accessible for all the Deep Learning based OCR models. Using text directly to generate the input image back gives us the advantage to use this pipeline for any OCR models even whose Softmax layer is not accessible.

Detecting inline MEs is a non-trivial problem due to the unrestricted usage of font styles and blurred boundaries with plaintext in scientific publications. For instance, many inline MEs detected by existing algorithms are split into multiple parts incorrectly due to the misidentification of a few characters. In this paper, we propose a bigram regularization model to resolve the split problem in inline ME detection. The model incorporates neighboring constraints during labeling of ME vs. plaintext. Experimental results show that this technique significantly reduces the splits of inline MEs, with small gains in the false and miss rate.

384,384,Virtual prototyping and physical experimentation of lower limb prosthesis,"Among rising technology in medical field, methods and solutions of reverse engineering have a high impact as a new possibility for improving the traditional processes to design prosthesis and orthoses. Furthermore, reverse engineering solutions allows managing a big amount of patient's data, which can be also exploited for making the medical assessment during rehabilitation activities more objective and measurable.

These IT devices can be exploited through customized software applications, which are able to combine many data types (e.g. 3D scanners, motion capture systems and pressure sensors). In this research work, the attention is focused on the design of lower limb prosthesis around the digital human model of the patient. We present a virtual platform composed by an ad-hoc developed application for customizing the prosthesis according to patients' life style and medical knowledge as well as for visualizing pressure on patient's limb while evaluating his/her gait in a unique virtual knowledge-guided environment.

385,385,The Determinants of Bitcoin Price Volatility: An Investigation with ARDL Model," Published by Elsevier B.V.The emergence of Bitcoin (BTC) has triggered intense discussions. Despite the particular interest of the public, the theoretical understanding of the value of this crypto currency is limited. This is why current research is trying to find better leads to evaluate a complex phenomenon: the BTC price. The volatility of its price presents a certain specificity compared to the traditional currencies. In order to understand the reasons for this volatility, we try to identify and to analyze the main determinants of the BTC price and to estimate their influence. We apply time series to daily data for the period from 19/12/2011 to 06/02/2018. We used several approaches, including the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag ARDL model, the cointegration test at Pesaran et al. (2001) and the Granger causality test in the sense of Toda and Yamamoto (1995). Our estimated results suggest that the number of addresses, the attractiveness indicator and the mining difficulty have a significant impact on the BTC price with variations over time. On the other hand, the transaction volume, the stock, the EUR/USD exchange rate and the macroeconomic and financial development do not determine the price of the BTC in the short term as well as in the long term.",60058071,Université de Sousse,Sousse,Tunisia,['1700'],20.6,0.059788359788359786,0.3637566137566137,0

Authenticating the smartphone's identity in addition to the user's identity is a widely adopted security augmentation method since conventional user authentication methods, such as password entry, often fail to provide strong protection by itself. In this paper, we propose a sensor-based device fingerprinting technique for identifying and authenticating individual mobile devices. Our technique, called MicPrint, exploits the unique characteristics of embedded microphones in mobile devices due to manufacturing variations in order to uniquely identify each device. Unlike conventional sensor-based device fingerprinting that are prone to spoofing attack via malware, MicPrint is fundamentally spoof-resistant since it uses acoustic features that are prominent only when the user blocks the microphone hole. This simple user intervention acts as implicit permission to fingerprint the sensor and can effectively prevent unauthorized fingerprinting using malware. We implement MicPrint on Google Pixel 1 and Samsung Nexus to evaluate the accuracy of device identification. We also evaluate its security against simple raw data attacks and sophisticated impersonation attacks.

Although the focus was put on the binary separation (i.e., foreground/background), the proposed framework is also used for the decomposition of document images into different components, i.e., background, text, and degradation, which allows full sources separation, whereby further analysis and characterization of each component can be possible.

The measurements were done at room temperature with non-frozen pork samples. The absorbance spectra of the main chromophores in meat including oxymyoglobin, water, fat, and protein were different enough to be identified spectrophotometrically. The decreasing trend in absorbance spectra of these components over time can be associated with freshness decay. We used two configurations, fiber-optic probes and integrating sphere, to study their efficiency in meat quality evaluation. In the integrated sphere configuration, the samples experienced an immediate smooth decrease of oxymyoglobin absorbance arising from loss of superficial freshness, while degradation kinetics of water, fat and protein absorbance were detected after about 2.5 hours. In the fiber-optic configuration capable for sensing up to 570-μm depth, the drop in oxymyoglobin absorbance started after 4.5 hours which would affect directly the color of sample associated with freshness.",60068673,National Research Nuclear University MEPhI,Moscow,Russian Federation,['1706'],22.428571428571427,0.20833333333333334,0.49166666666666664,0

396,396,Feeble Project Mandate equal higher cost?," Published by Elsevier B.V.This Study presents an analytical assessment of each of the Project Mandates and compares the results with the first estimates and final cost of governmental construction projects. The purpose of the study was to find out whether projects executed by a Governmental Agency (Statsbygg) under a less rigid Quality Assurance System behaves or delivers differently than a project that has undergone the national QA system. This paper presents the findings of a study where 19 Norwegian governmental construction projects were examined with the intent to analyze the correlation between the relative strength or weakness of the Project Mandate and the development of cost estimates through a project's phases. The study examined projects with estimates below the threshold for the Norwegian government's Quality Assurance system (QA). The project samples, consisting of projects between approx. €7m and €75m, has allowed the authors to examined whether the execution of government construction projects under a less rigid quality assurance system differs from projects that have undergone the national QA system. The relative strength of each Project Mandate was subjectively assessed against parameters related to the project's scope, assumptions and constraints. On average, the Project Mandates were found to be weak, often with poorly defined scopes and unrealistic constraints. The cost development from the estimated pre-design to completion phase showed an increase of 30%. While the lack of strong Project Mandates prevented the discovery of any conclusive findings in the study of correlation between the strength of the project mandate and cost, we believe that this paper presents novel insight into how smaller projects that have not gone through a rigid QA system behave.",60007008,Universitetet for miljø- og biovitenskap,As,Norway,['1700'],27.3,-0.0671875,0.3953125,0
397,397,A trust architecture for blockchain in IoT," Publication rights licensed to ACM.Blockchain is a promising technology for establishing trust in IoT networks, where network nodes do not necessarily trust each other. Cryptographic hash links and distributed consensus mechanisms ensure that the data stored on an immutable blockchain can not be altered or deleted. However, blockchain mechanisms do not guarantee the trustworthiness of data at the origin. We propose a layered architecture for improving the end-to-end trust that can be applied to a diverse range of blockchain-based IoT applications. Our architecture evaluates the trustworthiness of sensor observations at the data layer and adapts block verification at the blockchain layer through the proposed data trust and gateway reputation modules. We present the performance evaluation of the data trust module using a simulated indoor target localization and the gateway reputation module using an end-to-end blockchain implementation, together with a qualitative security analysis for the architecture.",60029470,Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization,Melbourne,Australia,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.333333333333332,0.018750000000000003,0.46875,0

Prevention programs must be not only valid and effective, but also attractive to young people. In fact, if the tool or program used is not attractive, the adherence to the treatment may not occur. The TeenPower project intended to create a platform for promoting healthy behaviors and fight overweight/obesity. This paper presents the preliminary results of the program regarding adolescents' lifestyle and the usability tests. Adolescents from three different schools in the center of Portugal were recruited. Results showed that adolescents presented moderate healthy lifestyles, with the Interpersonal Relationships subscale showing higher values. Boys presented higher values in the subscale of Interpersonal Relationships compared to girls (p<0.001) and there are statistical differences between schools relating to the Stress Management subscale (p=0.014). Most users made a positive assessment in terms of perception of utility, perception of ease and attitude towards the TeenPower app. Nonetheless only 33.2% of the adolescents invited activated their profile at the TeenPower app. This final assessment was important to gather information and feedback to improve future prevention programs, which should focus on motivating these adolescents and their parents to use this type of apps.

To assess the economic effect of road infrastructure, we first perform unit root tests using the augmented dickey-fuller (ADF) unit root test approach. Then, we assess the co-integration between road transport infrastructure and economic growth using the autoregressive distributed lag bound test model by conducting an F test. Once co-integration is established, the Ordinary Least Square estimation technique was used to estimate the elasticity of economic growth using autoregressive distributed lag-error correction model approaches; the obtained result shows that road infrastructure has a considerable positive effect on long-term economic growth in Ethiopia. The study concludes that road infrastructure is essential for growth in the economy and the study highlights substantial issues that policymakers should give due attention to the effective formulation and implementation of road infrastructure development policies in Ethiopia.",60019616,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",33.6,0.11873376623376622,0.3745562770562771,1
406,406,On the Radical De- and Re-Construction of Today's Enterprise Applications," Published by Elsevier B.V.The office applications (spreadsheets, text processing, presentation programs) used in today's enterprises are silos. So are the ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems. Tons of time is wasted to manually pump around data between office applications, ERP systems and the many further enterprise applications (CRM, DMS, BI etc. etc.) [1,2]. The whole situation is fragile (error prone), blocks business process re-engineering [3, 4] and prohibits (potentially massive) enterprise data analytics. Enterprise content management systems [5] help a little but do not fundamentally improve the situation: they do not crack the silos. The same is with the many enterprise application integration approaches (ad-hoc glue code [6], SOA platforms [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], BPM suites [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]): nice-to-have, but no game changers. Enterprise wikis [22] could help somehow, but their potential is not well understood by today's CIOs [1]; and again: they are silos. In this keynote, the presenter takes a different approach and fundamentally rethinks today's enterprise application landscape. He explains the vision of a so-called massive backbone application (or system-2 application in terms of Stafford Beer's Viable System Model [23, 24, 25]). He deconstructs today's enterprise applications into their essential particles and recombines them coherently into the new approach: (i) collaborative editing of semi-structured data (wikis) [26], (ii) data types (data+operations) [27, 28], (iii) access rights mechanisms [29], (iv) version control [30, 31, 32], (v) expression-level transclusion [33, 34] of typed data [35] and (vi) an integrated querying language [35]. With such a backbone application, today's enterprise applications become deeply standardized views (or perspectives) [36, 37] on a huge, single underlying information structure. Furthermore, (web) weaving [38, 39] of features becomes a first class citizen with such a backbone application. The presenter explains, how such a backbone application can radically improve the way we work.",60068861,Tallinna Tehnikaülikool,Tallinn,Estonia,['1700'],21.928571428571427,0.061559794372294384,0.5344651875901877,0

With the growth of endoscopic capsules and the lack of an appropriate tracking system to allow the localization of lesions, the need to develop software-based techniques for the localisation of the capsule at any given frame is also increasing. With this in mind, and knowing the lack of availability of labelled endoscopic datasets, this work aims to develop a unsupervised method for homography estimation in video capsule endoscopy frames, to later be applied in capsule localisation systems. The pipeline is based on an unsupervised convolutional neural network, with a VGG Net architecture, that estimates the homography between two images. The overall error, using a synthetic dataset, was evaluated through the mean average corner error, which was 34 pixels, showing great promise for the real-life application of this technique, although there is still room for the improvement of its performance.",60007249,Universidade do Porto,Porto,Portugal,['1700'],33.0,0.1,0.37159090909090914,0

Basically, when students intend to cheat, their body will emit a certain range of heat due to the interaction of the human’s body and their feelings. The emitted heat will trigger the camera to focus and detect the students’ face, next it will detect their eyes and start analyzing their movement and then determine whether a student has the intention to cheat or not. Eventually, applying this model would be very helpful in detecting the cheating intentions of the students, and the use of it is not limited to the educational environments only it could be applied on other areas with minor adjustment.",60104334,Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal university,Dammam,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],29.4,0.039999999999999994,0.33142857142857146,1
413,413,Attention after attention: Reading text in the wild with cross attention,"Recent methods mostly regarded scene text recognition as a sequence-to-sequence problem. These methods roughly transform the image into a feature sequence and use the algorithms for sequence-to-sequence problem like CTC or attention to decode the characters. However, text in images is distributed in a two-dimensional (2D) space and roughly converting the features of text into a feature sequence may introduce extra noise, especially if the text is irregular. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named cross attention network, which learns to attend to local features of a 2D feature map corresponding to individual characters. The network contains two 1D attention networks, which operates harmoniously in two directions. Thus, one of the attention modules vertically attends to the features corresponding to the whole text of 2D features and the other horizontal module selects the local features to decode individual characters. Extensive experiments are performed on various regular benchmarks, including SVT, ICDAR2003, ICDAR2013, and IIIT5K-Words, which demonstrate that the proposed model either outperforms or is comparable to all previous methods. Moreover, the model is evaluated on irregular benchmarks including SVT-Perspective, CUTE80 and ICDAR 2015.

However, earlier research indicate that the root of the accidents can often be found in the early phases of the project process. In this paper, we examine what occurs in the early phases of project management in construction that can be harmful to health and safety in the construction phase. The investigation focuses on two main research questions: 1) can health and safety in the construction phase be improved during the early phases of project management, and, if so, 2) what are the main challenges of health and safety in the early phases of project management that need to be addressed in order to do so? The data presented is collected by interviewing regional safety representatives in Norway. They point to three main challenges to health and safety in the early phases of construction projects: 1) lack of competence, 2) lack of prioritization, and 3) lack of consequence.

The proposed approach leverages textual and visual modalities to classify document images into ten categories, including letter, memo, news article, etc. In order to alleviate dependency of textual stream on performance of underlying OCR (which is the case with general content based document image classifiers), we utilize a filter based feature-ranking algorithm. This algorithm ranks the features of each class based on their ability to discriminate document images and selects a set of top 'K' features that are retained for further processing. In parallel, the visual stream uses deep CNN models to extract structural features of document images.Finally, textual and visual streams are concatenated together using an average ensembling method.

Considering the large difference between document objects and natural objects, we introduce some adaptive adjustments to YOLOv3, including an anchor optimization strategy and two post processing methods. For anchor optimization, we use k-means clustering to find anchors which are more suitable for tables rather than natural objects and make it easier for our model to find exact positions of tables. In post-processing process, the extra whitespaces and noisy page objects (e.g. page headers, page footers) are removed from the predicted results, so that our model can get more accurate table margins and higher IoU scores.

In this work, we present a novel alignment technique for segmenting page-level GT text into text lines during HTR model training. This text segmentation problem is formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the cost of aligning predicted lines with the GT text. Using both simulated and HTR model predictions, we show that the alignment method identifies line breaks accurately, even when the predicted lines have high character error rates (CER). We removed the GT line breaks from the ICDAR-2017 READ dataset and trained a HTR model using the proposed alignment method to predict line breaks on-the-fly. This model achieves comparable CER w.r.t. to the same model trained with the GT line breaks.

419,419,Upright and inverted polygon microscope (UNI-SCOPE)," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Cellular imaging in living animal has opened up a wide range of avenues to study cells in its microenvironment. High speed laser scanning microscopy possess the ability to observe fast real-Time biological phenomena such as cell movements, cell division, cells death. Due to the anatomical difference of difference organs in small animals, there is a need to engineer a flexible microscope that can readily adapt to different imaging position. For videorate imaging, the design of a flexible microscope depends mainly on scanning devices. Existing multiphoton microscope platforms (i.e. Thorlabs Bergamo® II Series) uses a rotating objective mount to conform of the specimens. This is possible because of the compact resonant mirror scanners. However, for varying imaging speed using a polygon microscope, this approach is not feasible due to high rotating speed. As such, we developed a dual objective microscope system that can achieve both upright and inverted, we termed it as UNI-SCOPE. The integrated platform can achieve flexible scanning speed of up to 120 FPS with an overall footprint of 450mm∗600mm∗450mm.

423,423,Outliers Treatment to Improve the Recognition of Voice Pathologies," Published by Elsevier B.V.In some of the processes used in data analysis, such as the recognition of pathologies and pathological subjects, the presence of anomalous instances in the dataset is an unfavorable situation that can lead to misleading results. This article presents a function that implements the identification of anomalies in dataset using the boxplot and standard deviation methods. Also was used the filling technique to treat these anomalies, in which the anomalous point value were substituted by a limit value determined by the boxplot or standard deviation methods. To improve the outliers methods some normalization processes based on the z-score, logarithmic and squared root methodologies were experimented. These outliers treatment were applied to the dataset used in the recognition of vocal pathologies (dysphonia, chronic laryngitis and vocal cords paralysis vs control), performed by a MLP and LSTM neural networks. After the experiments, both the standard deviation and the boxplot methods with z-score normalization showed very useful for pre-processing the dataset for voice pathologies recognition. The accuracy was improved between 3 and 13 points in percentage.",60027294,Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana,Curitiba,Brazil,['1700'],25.285714285714285,0.078,0.1,0
424,424,Lighter U-net for segmenting white matter hyperintensities in MR images,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) is one of main consequences of small vessel diseases. Automated WMH segmentation techniques play an important role in clinical research and practice. U-Net has been demonstrated to yield the best precise segmentation results so far. However, sometimes it losses more detailed information as network goes deeper. In addition, it usually depends on data augmentation or a large number of filters. Large filters increase the complexity of model, which may be an obstacle for real-time segmentation on cloud computing. To solve these two issues, a new architecture, Lighter U-Net is proposed to reinforce feature use, to reduce the number of parameters as well as to retain sufficient receptive fields without losing resolution. The extensive experiments suggest that the proposed network achieves comparable performance as the state-of-the-art methods by only using 17% parameters of standard U-Net.",60032083,"University at Buffalo, The State University of New York",Buffalo,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",17.25,0.18947510822510824,0.4986471861471861,1
425,425,PubLayNet: Largest dataset ever for document layout analysis,"Recognizing the layout of unstructured digital documents is an important step when parsing the documents into structured machine-readable format for downstream applications. Deep neural networks that are developed for computer vision have been proven to be an effective method to analyze layout of document images. However, document layout datasets that are currently publicly available are several magnitudes smaller than established computing vision datasets. Models have to be trained by transfer learning from a base model that is pre-trained on a traditional computer vision dataset. In this paper, we develop the PubLayNet dataset for document layout analysis by automatically matching the XML representations and the content of over 1 million PDF articles that are publicly available on PubMed Central. The size of the dataset is comparable to established computer vision datasets, containing over 360 thousand document images, where typical document layout elements are annotated. The experiments demonstrate that deep neural networks trained on PubLayNet accurately recognize the layout of scientific articles. The pre-trained models are also a more effective base mode for transfer learning on a different document domain.

Owing to large intra-individual variability, there is a critical requirement to accurately learn the intrapersonal variations of the signature to achieve higher classification accuracy. To achieve this, in this paper, we propose an OSV framework based on deep convolutional Siamese network (DCSN). DCSN automatically extract robust feature descriptions based on metric-based loss function which decreases intra-writer variability (Genuine-Genuine) and increase inter-individual variability (Genuine-Forgery) and guides the DCSN for effective discriminative representation learning for online signatures. Experiments conducted on three widely accepted datasets MCYT-100 (DB1), MCYT-330 (DB2) and SVC-2004-Task2 emphasize the capability of our framework to distinguish the genuine and forgery samples. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed DCSN in one shot learning by achieving a lower error rate as compared to many recent and state-of-the art OSV models.",60013290,University of Mysore,Mysore,India,['1707'],24.5,0.2403061224489796,0.5079931972789116,1
427,427,Page segmentation using a convolutional neural network with trainable co-occurrence features,"In document analysis, page segmentation is a fundamental task that divides a document image into semantic regions. In addition to local features, such as pixel-wise information, co-occurrence features are also useful for extracting texture-like periodic information for accurate segmentation. However, existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods do not have any mechanisms that explicitly extract co-occurrence features. In this paper, we propose a method for page segmentation using a CNN with trainable multiplication layers (TMLs). The TML is specialized for extracting co-occurrences from feature maps, thereby supporting the detection of objects with similar textures and periodicities. This property is also considered to be effective for document image analysis because of regularity in text line structures, tables, etc. In the experiment, we achieved promising performance on a pixel-wise page segmentation task by combining TMLs with U-Net. The results demonstrate that TMLs can improve performance compared to the original U-Net. The results also demonstrate that TMLs are helpful for detecting regions with periodically repeating features, such as tables and main text.",60011047,Kyushu University,Fukuoka,Japan,['1707'],18.666666666666668,0.20833333333333331,0.4242424242424242,1
428,428,A deep spatio-temporal attention-based neural network for passenger flow prediction,"Predicting the passenger flows in a city, especially in a metropolis, can guide traffic dispersion, and help assessing the risks of public safety and improving urban planning. However, it is challenging as passenger flows in a road network may vary with time and space, affected by weather conditions, urban activities, etc. In the paper, we propose a passenger flow prediction approach named Yildun, which constructs an encoder-decoder neural network and captures the spatial and temporal correlations inherent in passenger flows. More specifically, to predict the passenger flows at each and every station, a spatial attention mechanism is presented to adaptively extract inter-station correlations of flows by referring to the previous hidden state of the encoder at each time step. Meanwhile, a temporal attention mechanism is employed to capture time-dependent connections of flows by selecting relevant hidden states of the encoder across all time steps. Further, extra factors, such as POI (Point of Interest) data and day of the week, are fused in the decoder. With this spatio-temporal attention scheme, Yildun not only can make predictions effectively, but also is easily explainable. Extensive experiments are conducted on large-scale real-world data. The experimental results show that Yildun can predict passenger flows with small prediction errors and outperforms five baselines significantly.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",23.11111111111111,0.10791666666666669,0.5020833333333334,1

These state-of-the-art (SOA) networks have been adapted to the task of single text image super resolution and have been shown to boost the optical character recognition (OCR) performance. However, these approaches depend on variations of the standard mean squared error (MSE) loss in order to train the SR network for improving the text image quality which does not guarantee optimal OCR performance. In this paper, we propose to combine the OCR performance into the loss function during network training. This results in the generation of high resolution text images that achieve high OCR performance that is comparable to the ground truth high-resolution text images and surpassing those of the SOA baseline results. We define novel intuitive metrics to capture the improvement in the OCR performance and provide extensive experiments to qualitatively and quantitatively assess improvement in the results of our proposed approach against the SOA baselines on the standard UNLV dataset.",60011048,IBM Research,Yorktown Heights,United States,['1707'],28.666666666666668,0.0573917748917749,0.38752164502164504,1

437,437,Cross-modal prototype learning for zero-shot handwriting recognition,"In contrast to machine recognizers that rely on training with large handwriting data, humans can recognize handwriting accurately on learning from few samples, and can even generalize to handwritten characters from printed samples. Simulating this ability in machine recognition is important to alleviate the burden of labeling large handwriting data, especially for large category set as in Chinese text. In this paper, inspired by human learning, we propose a cross-modal prototype learning (CMPL) method for zero-shot online handwritten character recognition: for unseen categories, handwritten characters can be recognized without learning from handwritten samples, but instead from printed characters. Particularly, the printed characters (one for each class) are embedded into a convolutional neural network (CNN) feature space to obtain prototypes representing each class, while the online handwriting trajectories are embedded with a recurrent neural network (RNN). Via cross-modal joint learning, handwritten characters can be recognized according to the printed prototypes. For unseen categories, handwritten characters can be recognized by only feeding a printed sample per category. Experiments on a benchmark Chinese handwriting database have shown the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method for zero-shot handwriting recognition.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1707'],26.571428571428573,0.10842490842490841,0.4963369963369963,1

This has resulted in a transition from physical contact in traditional service delivery to digitized user interactions on service platforms. Gleaning insight from patterns of user connections to these services is important for effective service management. First, a user-state bipartite labelled property graph model is constructed for user-connection behaviour analyses. Unlike previous works, the proposed model is neither restricted by the pre-partitioning of data nor the pre-aggregation of edge weights. This model is used to perform flexible versions of static analysis conducted in earlier research works. These ad hoc graph traversal user-connection analyses are typical of real world business scenarios. In this work, they are used to reveal patterns for the range of user interest, user interest intensity and service utilization. Also, an illustration is given of how to perform service recommendation. In addition, an extended model created by enriching a one mode user projection of the bipartite network with connected features is proposed and used to predict user connection behaviour.

446,446,Release of unverified plaintext: Tight unified model and application to ANYDAE," All rights reserved.Authenticated encryption schemes are usually expected to offer confidentiality and authenticity. In case of release of unverified plaintext (RUP), an adversary gets separated access to the decryption and verification functionality, and has more power in breaking the scheme. Andreeva et al. (ASIACRYPT 2014) formalized RUP security using plaintext awareness, informally meaning that the decryption functionality gives no extra power in breaking confidentiality, and INT-RUP security, covering authenticity in case of RUP. We describe a single, unified model, called AERUP security, that ties together these notions: we prove that an authenticated encryption scheme is AERUP secure if and only if it is conventionally secure, plaintext aware, and INT-RUP secure. We next present ANYDAE, a generalization of SUNDAE of Banik et al. (ToSC 2018/3). ANYDAE is a lightweight deterministic scheme that is based on a block cipher with block size n and arbitrary mixing functions that all operate on an n-bit state. It is particularly efficient for short messages, it does not rely on a nonce, and it provides maximal robustness to a lack of secure state. Whereas SUNDAE is not secure under release of unverified plaintext (a fairly simple attack can be mounted in constant time), ANYDAE is. We make handy use of the AERUP security model to prove that ANYDAE achieves both conventional security as RUP security, provided that certain modest conditions on the mixing functions are met. We describe two simple instances, called MONDAE and TUESDAE, that conform to these conditions and that are competitive with SUNDAE, in terms of efficiency and optimality.",60105479,"Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi",New Delhi,India,"['1712', '1706']",21.416666666666668,0.12246376811594203,0.4553830227743271,0

The supply chain is one of the fields that Blockchain is expected to be applied. The paper aims to combine blockchain with distributed storage and propose blockchain for the supply chain. Blockchain is not fit to record a lot of information. It requires both on-chain storage of the core ledger data and off-chain storage of data required by smart contracts for verification and documentation. The Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) is a concrete solution. IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. Participants can address large amounts of data with IPFS and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures their content, without having to put the data itself on the chain.

During training, the proposed Cross-VAE is trained to minimize the reconstruction loss of the two modalities, the distribution loss of the two VAEs, and a novel third loss called the space sharing loss. This third, space sharing loss is used to encourage the modalities to share the same latent space by calculating the distance between the latent variables. Through the proposed method mutual conversion of online and offline handwritten characters is possible. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of the Cross-VAE through qualitative and quantitative analysis.",60011047,Kyushu University,Fukuoka,Japan,['1707'],17.625,-0.025,0.3,1

451,451,A generalized mechanism beyond NLP for real-time detection of cyber abuse through facial expression analytics,"Abuse in cyber space is a problem requiring immediate attention. Unfortunately, despite advances in Natural Language Processing techniques, there are clear limitations in detecting instances of cyber abuse today. Challenges arising due to different languages that teens communicate with today, and usage of codes along with code mixing and code switching make the design of a comprehensive approach very hard. Existing NLP based approaches for detecting cyber abuse thus suffer from a high degree of false negatives and positives. In this paper, we investigate a new approach to detect instances of cyber abuse. Our approach is motivated by the premise that abusers tend to have unique facial expressions while engaging in an actual abuse episode, and if we are successful, such an approach will be language-agnostic. Here, using only four carefully identified facial features without any language processing, and realistic experiments with 15 users, our system proposed in this paper achieves 98% accuracy for same-user evaluation and up to 74% accuracy for cross-user evaluation in detecting instances of cyber abuse.",60021158,Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology,Dhaka,Bangladesh,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.285714285714285,0.035992822966507174,0.5600199362041467,1
452,452,A neural approach for text extraction from scholarly figures,"In recent years, the problem of scene text extraction from images has received extensive attention and significant progress. However, text extraction from scholarly figures such as plots and charts remains an open problem, in part due to the difficulty of locating irregularly placed text lines. To the best of our knowledge, literature has not described the implementation of a text extraction system for scholarly figures that adapts deep convolutional neural networks used for scene text detection. In this paper, we propose a text extraction approach for scholarly figures that forgoes preprocessing in favor of using a deep convolutional neural network for text line localization. Our system uses a publicly available scene text detection approach whose network architecture is well suited to text extraction from scholarly figures. Training data are derived from charts in arXiv papers which are extracted using Allen Institute's pdffigures tool. Since this tool analyzes PDF data as a container format in order to extract text location through the mechanisms which render it, we were able to gather a large set of labeled training samples.

Our cells and plant cells produce free radicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) continuously as a byproduct of oxygen metabolism and reaction to various environmental stresses, which must be normalized to avoid oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is intimately linked to cellular energy balance and occurs when there's an imbalance between production and accumulation of ROS in cells and tissues and the ability of a biological system to keep in a redox steady state. We show preliminary results of an optical fiber based reversible in-vivo biosensor for understanding redox balance within living systems.

462,462,A character attention generative adversarial network for degraded historical document restoration,"Despite of recent breakthroughs in the accuracy of single character recognition using the deeper convolution neural networks, one of the remaining problems is that OCRs almost fail to recognize character patterns when they are severely degraded, especially those of the historical documents. Another problem to recognize characters in historical documents is the lack of sufficient training patterns because of the heavy cost for annotation. This paper proposes a character attention generative adversarial network named CAGAN for restoring heavily degraded character patterns in historical documents so that OCRs improve their accuracy and even help archeologists to decode them. The network is based on the U-Net like architecture [1] with skip connections, and it is trained by the proposed loss function including the common adversarial loss (global loss) and the hierarchical character attentive loss (local loss). We made an experiment on 118 categories of most common Japanese Kanji characters, collected from severely damaged historical documents called Heijokyo mokkan written during the Nara period in Japan. The experiment shows that our method restores the shapes of characters and improves the recognition rate significantly, which is helpful for archeologists to decode damaged character patterns.",60004853,Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology,Fuchu,Japan,['1707'],31.666666666666668,-0.01646825396825396,0.33551587301587305,1

As a result, Line-of-Sight (LoS) identification and corresponding subcarrier parameter estimation play an important role in improving positioning accuracy. In this paper, we propose a complete parameter processing framework, which involves phase calibration, phase ambiguity elimination, subcarrier parameter (amplitude and phase) estimation of LoS, fingerprint feature extraction and relationship mapping from fingerprint feature to position estimate.

Sleep disorders are one of the main reasons for the inadequate sleep problem. Diagnosis of these disorders is a very challenging task because they occur at night when the patients are asleep and require a full night monitoring to diagnose. Conventional sleep monitoring techniques are not feasible due to various reasons such as they require the person to wear multiple invasive sensors, the cost is high and also need special environment for monitoring. In this work, we propose a non-invasive and cost-effective solution based on passive RFID technology for sleep monitoring. We attach passive RFID tags to the shirt of the person and collect low-level data which can capture the information about the vital signs of the person. The proposed solution can detect the on-bed movements which provide useful information about the sleep of the person. We propose an adaptive threshold-based technique which can effectively identify the stable breathing and apnea regions from the collected breathing signal. The stable region is used for estimating the breathing rate. Our solution can monitor vital signs such as respiration rate during the overnight sleep and can detect sleep apnea.

Detecting when a person is lying has important applications, especially with the ubiquity of messaging via smart-phones, coupled with rampant increases in (intentional) spread of mis-information today. In this paper, we design a technique to detect whether or not a person's textual inputs when typed via a smartphone indicate lying. To do so, first, we judiciously develop a smartphone based survey that guarantees any participant to provide a mix of true and false responses. While the participant is texting out responses to each question, the smartphone measures readings from its inbuilt inertial sensors, and then computes features like shaking, acceleration, tilt angle, typing speed etc. experienced by it. Subsequently, for each participant (47 in total), we glean the true and false responses using our own experiences with them, and also via informal discussions with each participant. By comparing the responses of each participant, along with the corresponding motion features computed by the smartphone, we implement several machine learning algorithms to detect when a participant is lying, and our accuracy is around 70% in the most stringent leave-one-out evaluation strategy. Later, utilizing findings of our analysis, we develop an architecture for real-time lie detection using smartphones.

In such dynamic scenarios, it is very costly to obtain the inter-UAV channel state information (CSI) with the conventional pilot-aided channel estimation. Aiming to address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a novel adaptive-structure extreme learning machine (ASELM) enabled fast channel predication to obtain the CSI in a proactive fashion, which can further support agile beam-based inter-UAV mmWave communication. In particular, ASELM copes with the channel variations by adaptively adjusting the number of neurons in the hidden-layer of ELM. Moreover, a sliding window prediction mechanism (SWPM) predicts subsequent-CSI by efficiently reuses the predicted concurrent-CSI to train the ASELM, which is able to save the pilot overhead for channel sampling (estimation) towards longer-range channel prediction and improve prediction accuracy at affordable costs.

476,476,Multiple comparative attention network for offline handwritten chinese character recognition,"Recent advances in deep learning have made great progress in offline Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR). However, most existing CNN-based methods only utilize global image features as contextual guidance to classify characters, while neglecting the local discriminative features which is very important for HCCR. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present a convolutional neural network with multiple comparative attention (MCANet) in order to produce separable local attention regions with discriminative feature across different categories. Concretely, our MCANet takes the last convolutional feature map as input and outputs multiple attention maps, a contrastive loss is used to restrict different attention selectively focus on different sub-regions. Moreover, we apply a region-level center loss to pull the features that learned from the same class and different regions closer to further obtain robust features invariant to large intra-class variance. Combining with classification loss, our method can learn which parts of images are relevant for recognizing characters and adaptively integrates information from different regions to make the final prediction.

Due to the lack of benefits realized from information systems or IT projects, some studies call to adopt benefits management approaches and techniques to respond to that challenge. Particularly, in the implementation of ERP systems, there is limited studies that showed benefits management techniques that can be used to effectively realize benefits from these systems. This paper builds on previous research to investigate to what extent the application of the benefits management techniques within the ERP implementation process is viable.

In this work we studied how script languages affect a text detector's performance by using a multi-language synthetic dataset-namely, the Synthetic Octa-Language (SOL) dataset. The effect of script languages continues to be largely unexplored. Previously, this kind of experiment was infeasible because too many factors influence the performance of a text detector. We really cannot tell what role the factor X plays, neither positive nor negative. To overcome these difficulties, we used controlled synthesized data, which allows us to explicitly control factors such as base image, script language, text content, text color, font face, and font size. With the SOL dataset, we were able to investigate the effect that script languages have on on deep neural-network (DNN)-based methods under different scenarios.

482,482,"Illegitimate HIS access by healthcare professionals: Scenarios, use cases and audit trail-based detection model"," Published by Elsevier B.V.Healthcare institutions face serious security challenges, namely confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient's data due to the amounts of sensitive data collected on Health Information Systems (HIS) and the complex data management processes in health care. This paper describes scenarios of undue HIS access by staff in healthcare institutions, use cases (UC) that model the activities on HIS and identify the variables on audit trails (AT) logs that can be used to detect illegitimate actions on patients' data. Firstly, a survey was conducted through discussion meetings with Information Systems Director (ISD), Data Protection Officer (DPO) and a jurist to discuss their concerns about patient data access, followed by interviews to professionals from healthcare institutions to gather information about their routines and HIS access practices. Then, undue access scenarios were described and UC of activities on HIS which allow their detection were modelled. Lastly, necessary log variables were identified in order to produce algorithms for illegitimate accesses detection. UC and variables selected were matched with the specific requirements of Ministers Council Resolution (MCR) nr.41/2018 which provides guidelines for technology to be compliant with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). Discussions with ISD, DPO and the jurist, and professionals' interviews allowed us to describe nine scenarios of undue access. For each scenario we modelled one UC. 32 variables from different type of logs were identified for illegitimate access detection, of which 14 are mandatory according to MCR nr. 41/2018. Despite we might have some limitations related to poor HIS log quality, the mandatory data that logs must comply will be very useful for the development of UC presented. In addition, it is possible to request systems' vendors the improvement of logs' data to meet the detail we propose for this model, which may be very useful to comply not only with GDPR requirements but also with the Standard ""Management of Information"" (MOI.11) of Joint Commission International Standards for Hospitals (JCI) certification.

The post-processing step reconstructs the bounding boxes for characters from the five-channel image of the FCN output. The proposed method possesses the following advantages: (1) It is possible to process input images including multiple text lines directly; in other words, a text line segmentation process is unnecessary. (2) It does not rely upon character recognition. (3) It is robust to variations in the sizes of characters and the gaps between characters and also to cursive characters or character overlap.

In recent years, many researchers have been applying deep neural network methods to the signature verification task. However, these methods have not outperformed traditional methods, especially when the training samples are limited. In this paper, we propose a novel stroke-based bidirectional RNN architecture. The main idea is to split the signature into multiple patches using strokes. Concatenation of query and reference signature pairs are used as input. The proposed method uses two LSTM RNN networks to extract different features. The first one extracts the features of the strokes and the latter extracts the global features of the whole signatures. The results on the BiosecureID dataset demonstrate that our proposed method can reduce the EER by 33.05%, from 5.6% to 3.75% with fewer features and less training samples.

In addition to its crucial role in ensuring a healthy and sustainable future, adopting a data-driven approach for modeling and predicting fitness center equipment usage is necessary for planning the optimal square footage for developing a fitness center, and determining the kinds of equipment to purchase and install. In this paper, we develop DeepFit, a deep learning based system that predicts future fitness center equipment usage based on historical data. To this end, we design a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based sequence-to-sequence model that captures the dependencies in the data. The sequence-to-sequence model comprises of an encoder and a decoder, each of which separately is a deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The basic cell structure in the RNN architecture is an LSTM cell. We evaluate DeepFit on equipment usage data collected from a university campus fitness center over a period of 1.5 years and demonstrate that it is able to accurately predict future fitness center equipment usage.

500,500,Achieving 3D FRAP using multiphoton polygon scanning microscopy," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) has been developed to measure molecular diffusion in living cells. However, conventional FRAP using a single stationary beam guided by a pair of galvanometer mirrors is not tailored for raster scanning microscopy. Furthermore, it has been shown that a single point of 2D FRAP only acquires molecular diffusion within a given imaging plane and does not fully capture the full molecular dynamics. Here, we address these limitations with a custom-built 2-photon polygon scanning microscope that features volumetric scanning with a frame rate of 20 fps and 170 nm pixel size. Importantly, our system allows photomanipulation to selectively measure FRAP from the diffusion dynamics of fluorescent molecules in a 3D sample. To demonstrate these capabilities, we performed rapid axial scans of fluorescent beads in suspension, achieving a volumetric scan rate of less than a second. FRAP functionality was verified in vitro on sulforhodamine-labelled giant unilamellar vesicles and diffusion kinetics determined from the rate of fluorescence recovery. The resolution and speed introduced from polygon scanning microscopy coupled with photomanipulation capabilities sets a precedent for 2-photon 3D FRAP imaging.",60008950,Australian National University,Canberra,Australia,['1706'],23.875,0.03614718614718615,0.4547619047619047,0
501,501,Quantifying location privacy in permissioned blockchain-based internet of things (IoT),"Recently, blockchain has received much attention from the mobility-centric Internet of Things (IoT). It is deemed the key to ensuring the built-in integrity of information and security of immutability by design in the peer-to-peer network (P2P) of mobile devices. In a permissioned blockchain, the authority of the system has control over the identities of its users. Such information can allow an ill-intentioned authority to map identities with their spatiotemporal data, which undermines the location privacy of a mobile user. In this paper, we study the location privacy preservation problem in the context of permissioned blockchain-based IoT systems under three conditions. First, the authority of the blockchain holds the public and private key distribution task in the system. Second, there exists a spatiotemporal correlation between consecutive location-based transactions. Third, users communicate with each other through short-range communication technologies such that it constitutes a proof of location (PoL) on their actual locations. We show that, in a permissioned blockchain with an authority and a presence of a PoL, existing approaches cannot be applied using a plug-and-play approach to protect location privacy. In this context, we propose BlockPriv, an obfuscation technique that quantifies, both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship between privacy and utility in order to dynamically protect the privacy of sensitive locations in the permissioned blockchain.",60015206,Florida International University,Miami,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.4,0.0328125,0.38125,1

Here, we address these issues for the first time in this context by leveraging the existence of stationary crowd that have timetabled roles, such as desk-bound employees, lecturers and students. We propose a scalable and effortless positioning system in the context of a public/commercial building by using Wi-Fi sensor readings from its stationary occupants' smartphones combined with their timetabling information. Most significantly, the entropy concept of information theory is utilised to differentiate between good and spurious measurements in a manner that does not rely on the existence of known trusted users. Our analysis and experimental results show that, regardless of such participants' unpredictable behaviour, including not following their timetabling information, hiding their location or purposefully generating wrong data, our entropy-based filtering approach ensures the creation of a radio-map incrementally from their measurements. Its effectiveness is validated experimentally with two well-known machine learning algorithms.",60021889,University of Greenwich,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",29.714285714285715,0.11614583333333336,0.47187500000000004,1
504,504,Advanced machine learning for gesture learning and recognition based on intelligent big data of heterogeneous sensors,"With intelligent big data, a variety of gesture-based recognition systems have been developed to enable intuitive interaction by utilizing machine learning algorithms. Realizing a high gesture recognition accuracy is crucial, and current systems learn extensive gestures in advance to augment their recognition accuracies. However, the process of accurately recognizing gestures relies on identifying and editing numerous gestures collected from the actual end users of the system. This final end-user learning component remains troublesome for most existing gesture recognition systems. This paper proposes a method that facilitates end-user gesture learning and recognition by improving the editing process applied on intelligent big data, which is collected through end-user gestures. The proposed method realizes the recognition of more complex and precise gestures by merging gestures collected from multiple sensors and processing them as a single gesture. To evaluate the proposed method, it was used in a shadow puppet performance that could interact with on-screen animations. An average gesture recognition rate of 90% was achieved in the experimental evaluation, demonstrating the efficacy and intuitiveness of the proposed method for editing visualized learning gestures.",60009387,"Dongguk University, Seoul",Seoul,South Korea,['1701'],22.375,0.15421768707482994,0.4771882086167801,1

510,510,Multiple linear cryptanalysis using linear statistics," All rights reserved.We propose an improved and extended approach of the multiple linear cryptanalysis presented by A. Biryukov et al. at CRYPTO 2004 that exploits dominant and statistically independent linear trails. While they presented only rank based attacks with success probability 1, we present threshold based attacks as well as rank based ones using newly introduced statistic that is a linear combination of the component statistics for the trails and is an approximation of the LLR statistic. The rank based Algorithm 1 style attack yields the same estimate for the gain with Biryukov et al.’s Algorithm 1 style attack. For each of the threshold based Algorithm 1 style and Algorithm 2 style attacks, we provide a formula for its advantage in terms of the correlations of the trails, the data complexity, and the success probability in case the aimed success probability is not 1. Combining the threshold based attacks with the rank based ones, we get attacks each of which has better estimates for the advantage compared to the threshold based one in case the aimed success probability is close to 1. We then extend the methods to get a new framework of multiple linear attacks exploiting close-to-dominant linear trails that may not be statistically independent. We apply the methods to full DES and get linear attacks using 4 linear trails with about the same or better complexity compared to those presented at ASIACRYPT 2017 that use 4 additional trails. With data complexity less than 241, the attack has better complexity than existing attacks on DES.",60001558,Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute,Daejeon,South Korea,"['1712', '1706']",25.7,-0.0019104084321475531,0.3532938076416337,0

Past studies improved the sensitivity of diamonds containing NV centres by increasing their density or prolonging their coherence time. However, few studies discussed the effects of other defects inside the diamond crystal on the sensitivity of the NV centres. In this study, we demonstrated the implication of single substitutional nitrogen defects on the fluorescence emission, charge state stability, coherence time and sensitivity of the NV centres. We found that there is an optimal concentration of nitrogen defects that allows diamond samples to have a high-density of NV centres and high fluorescence without significantly affecting the coherence time.

Automated analysis of large art collections, which are growing as a result of art digitization among museums and galleries, is an important tool for art history and assists cultural heritage preservation. Modern image retrieval systems offer good performance on visually similar artworks, but fail in the cases of more abstract composition transfer. The proposed approach links artworks through a pose similarity of human figures depicted in images. Human figures are the subject of a large fraction of visual art from middle ages to modernity and their distinctive poses were often a source of inspiration among artists. The method consists of two steps-fast pose matching and robust spatial verification. We experimentally show that explicit human pose matching is superior to standard content-based image retrieval methods on a manually annotated art composition transfer dataset.",60013323,Ceské vysoké ucení technické v Praze,Prague,Czech Republic,['1707'],20.857142857142858,0.12957393483709273,0.3152882205513785,1

516,516,A principled look at the utility of feedback in congestion control," Publication rights licensed to ACM.Networked applications are ubiquitous and their performance requirements are becoming increasingly stringent. Network congestion can seriously impact performance contributing to increased latency, packet loss and poor throughput. To address these problems, the networking community has come up with a large number of congestion control algorithms. Congestion control schemes developed over the past few decades can be classified into two broad classes: one based on an end-system's perception of network congestion and the other based on the network providing feedback to flows that pass through it. In this paper, we make the observation that the pure end-system based congestion control schemes are faced with the significant challenge of receiving ambiguous signals that make it difficult to infer where the congestion is occurring and if this flow is even the cause of that congestion. This ambiguity makes it difficult for pure end-system based control schemes to achieve fairness across different flows. Modern routers and switches in the meantime, have grown in computing capability and can generate fine grained feedback at line speeds for flows traversing them. We show that even relatively simple feedback generated in-network at the point of congestion eliminates the ambiguities faced by pure end-system based congestion control mechanisms, thus ensuring the network functions at the right fair and efficient operating point. We provide the theoretical underpinnings establishing the need for in-network feedback to enable the network to operate at a unique fixed point at the intersection of the desired fair and efficient operation regimes, and demonstrate through emulation experiments that our use of the well-established and studied PI-control for Active Queue Management and Explicit Congestion Notification meets the goals of low latency, high throughput and fine granularity control of the queue while achieving fairness.",60030162,Columbia University in the City of New York,New York,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",32.22222222222222,0.09506978653530378,0.5376067323481116,0

518,518,Performance Analysis of XQAM in Log-Normal Turbulence with Pointing Error and Non-zero Boresight,"In recent years, free-space optical (FSO) technology has gained fame in communication systems due to its high data rates and license-free feature. Cross quadrature amplitude modulation (X-QAM) is an optimum modulation scheme that uses odd bits per symbol and it has a low average symbol error rate (ASER) than rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (R-QAM). In this paper, we theoretically investigate the performance of subcarrier cross quadrature amplitude modulation (SC-XQAM) corrupted by atmospheric turbulence in the presence of pointing errors (P.E) in FSO communications. We have considered boresight displacement, P.E effect, and atmospheric turbulence. To represent the atmospheric turbulence we consider Log-normal distribution that exhibits weak, moderate and strong weather effects. The P.E is employed using Rician distribution that incorporates boresight displacement. P.E is modeled using an optical beam radius and receiver aperture radius. The combination of these parameters will help enhance the average symbol error rate (ASER). Furthermore, we have derived an analytical expression that is used to develop numerical result. The ASER performance is observed against optical beam radius, P.E standard deviation and receiver aperture radius.

520,520,Comprehensive security analysis of CRAFT," All rights reserved.CRAFT is a lightweight block cipher, designed to provide efficient protection against differential fault attacks. It is a tweakable cipher that includes 32 rounds to produce a ciphertext from a 64-bit plaintext using a 128-bit key and 64-bit public tweak. In this paper, compared to the designers’ analysis, we provide a more detailed analysis of CRAFT against differential and zero-correlation cryptanalysis, aiming to provide better distinguishers for the reduced rounds of the cipher. Our distinguishers for reduced-round CRAFT cover a higher number of rounds compared to the designers’ analysis. In our analysis, we observed that, for any number of rounds, the differential effect of CRAFT has an extremely higher probability compared to any differential trail. As an example, while the best trail for 11 rounds of the cipher has a probability of at least 2−80, we present a differential with probability 2−49.79, containing 229.66 optimal trails, all with the same optimum probability of 2−80. Next, we use a partitioning technique, based on optimal expandable truncated trails to provide a better estimation of the differential effect on CRAFT. Thanks to this technique, we are able to find differential distinguishers for 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 rounds of the cipher in single tweak model with the probabilities of at least 2−40.20, 2−45.12, 2−49.79, 2−54.49, 2−59.13, and 2−63.80, respectively. These probabilities should be compared with the best distinguishers provided by the designers in the same model for 9 and 10 rounds of the cipher with the probabilities of at least 2−54.67 and 2−62.61, respectively. In addition, we consider the security of CRAFT against the new concept of related tweak zero-correlation (ZC) linear cryptanalysis and present a new distinguisher which covers 14 rounds of the cipher, while the best previous ZC distinguisher covered 13 rounds. Thanks to the related tweak ZC distinguisher for 14 rounds of the cipher, we also present 14 rounds integral distinguishers in related tweak mode of the cipher.

525,525,DeepHSV: User-independent offline signature verification using two-channel CNN,"Off-line handwritten signature verification has practical significance in financial, administrative and judicial field. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted local and global feature descriptors. Recently, researchers start to apply convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn representative features towards this task. However, most of these methods suffer from overfitting. In this paper we propose a novel two-channel CNN network, namely 2-Channel-2-Logit (2C2L), to address this issue. The input to the network is the concatenation of reference and query signatures. The output of convolutional layers are two logits that measure the similarity between reference and query signatures. We explicitly add dropout layers and a 2-Logit layer to make the network less prone to overfitting issues. The proposed method uses only one reference signature for testing and the training system is independent from the queried user. Experiments on the latest GPDS-Synthetic database demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve verification accuracy.

526,526,P4-enabled network-assisted congestion feedback: A case for nacks,"There exists an extensive body of work, spanning more than two decades, on congestion control schemes and signaling mechanisms. The majority of prior work does not, however, entertain the notion of network-assisted feedback for congestion control. The scope of the remaining work has also been, unfortunately, rather narrow: Some efforts limit themselves to using weak signals (involving a few bits in the header) and relying on receivers to reflect such signals to the sender; few others maintain per-flow statistics or explicitly set the rates the senders should use. Virtually all suggested network-assisted congestion feedback mechanisms are ineffective, not scalable, or limited to data-center contexts. In this proposal, we exploit data-plane programmability of P4 switches as well as hardware-supported priority classes to present a novel network-assisted congestion feedback (NCF) mechanism.

527,527,LifeTag: Vital Sign Detection for Drowning People in Sea Accidents by Wearable Device,"For lifesaving in shipwreck accidents, a wearable device, called LifeTag is designed for marine travellers. The LifeTag integrates localization, communication and life-sign detection modules, which will be triggered on automatically when falling into water and broadcasts the location and life status of the drowning people, so that rescuing ships within 10 nautical miles can receive the signal. This will speed up the drowning people searching and rescue process to improve the lifesaving probability. This paper focuses on the design of data processing technique to accurately detect the life status of drowning people. Real experiments are conducted which show that the inertial sensor data can be processed by machine learning method to efficiently detect the drowning people's life sign. But a challenge problem is that LifeTag requires a very efficient implementation of the classifier, which needs to be embedded into the resource limited firmware of the LifeTag device. To accomplish this, we investigate key feature selection and seek for the efficient and effective classifier design. A simplified online classifier is therefore investigated. Finally, we implement the optimized classifier into the firm ware.

528,528,Speeding-up the handwritten signature segmentation process through an optimized fully convolutional neural network,"The handwritten signature is the most used method of identity authentication. Due to their nature, signatures can be used as an agreement in many types of documentation with legal repercussions. The validation of the firmed signature is used to prevent frauds, fake documents, and identity checking. However, working with automated signature verification is a challenging task because it can appear in any part of documents with complex backgrounds, with logos, handwritten texts, and many different patterns. Besides, the application needs to consider a real-time response. In this paper, we propose an optimized architecture of a fully convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture for handwritten signature segmentation. Furthermore, we used data augmentation in order to increase the diversity of the available dataset and prevent the overfitting problem when training the proposed model. We conducted experiments with DSSigDataset, and we used four different data augmentation techniques to increase the dataset size.

532,532,Using Arabic Tweets to Understand Drug Selling Behaviors," Published by Elsevier B.V.Twitter is a popular platform for e-commerce in the Arab region - including the sale of illegal goods and services. Social media platforms present multiple opportunities to mine information about behaviors pertaining to both illicit and pharmaceutical drugs and likewise to legal prescription drugs sold without a prescription, i.e., illegally. Recognized as a public health risk, the sale and use of illegal drugs, counterfeit versions of legal drugs, and legal drugs sold without a prescription constitute a widespread problem that is reflected in and facilitated by social media. Twitter provides a crucial resource for monitoring legal and illegal drug sales in order to support the larger goal of finding ways to protect patient safety. We collected our dataset using Arabic keywords. We then categorized the data using four machine learning classifiers. Based on a comparison of the respective results, we assessed the accuracy of each classifier in predicting two important considerations in analysing the extent to which drugs are available on social media: references to drugs for sale and the legality/illegality of the drugs thus advertised. For predicting tweets selling drugs, Support Vector Machine, yielded the highest accuracy rate (96%), whereas for predicting the legality of the advertised drugs, the Naïve Bayes, classifier yielded the highest accuracy rate (85%).",60104126,Jouf University,Sakakah,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],26.625,0.014999999999999996,0.3483333333333334,0

534,534,Is an affine constraint needed for affine subspace clustering?,"Subspace clustering methods based on expressing each data point as a linear combination of other data points have achieved great success in computer vision applications such as motion segmentation, face and digit clustering. In face clustering, the subspaces are linear and subspace clustering methods can be applied directly. In motion segmentation, the subspaces are affine and an additional affine constraint on the coefficients is often enforced. However, since affine subspaces can always be embedded into linear subspaces of one extra dimension, it is unclear if the affine constraint is really necessary. This paper shows, both theoretically and empirically, that when the dimension of the ambient space is high relative to the sum of the dimensions of the affine subspaces, the affine constraint has a negligible effect on clustering performance. Specifically, our analysis provides conditions that guarantee the correctness of affine subspace clustering methods both with and without the affine constraint, and shows that these conditions are satisfied for high-dimensional data. Underlying our analysis is the notion of affinely independent subspaces, which not only provides geometrically interpretable correctness conditions, but also clarifies the relationships between existing results for affine subspace clustering.",60005248,Johns Hopkins University,Baltimore,United States,"['1712', '1707']",27.142857142857142,0.1310714285714286,0.4278571428571429,1

Therefore, a method to measure university-industry R&D collaborations, named MPUIC, developed based on Design Science Research methodology (DSRM), was applied and validated through a case study. This paper firstly describes some improvements made to the previously developed MPUIC method before its application to a large program between the University of Minho and Bosch Car Multimedia (Portugal). The MPUIC method adopted a weighted scoring approach, and is composed by 31 performance indicators, distributed through the program management life cycle. Secondly, the performance measurement of the case study program is conducted, resulting in a score of 4.4 in a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 indicates ""very high"" performance. Finally, a questionnaire was administered to evaluate the developed method and, from the 31 performance indicators that compose the method, 29 were evaluated as having a level of relevance above 3 in a scale of 1 to 5 and, from these, 19 were evaluated as having a level of relevance equal to or above 4.",60020475,Universidade do Minho,Braga,Portugal,['1700'],35.0,0.158152380952381,0.45426031746031736,0

This framework is modeled by a dynamic game with incomplete information, in which each player in the game aspires to improve its position in the network by forming cooperative groups. Instead of static systems, the attention we paid in this paper is highly dynamic networks, where the users' high mobility brings a huge challenge in clustering. In order to mitigate that impact, this paper is from the perspective of social relations to clustering, extracting users' social nature from their mobile patterns and designing distributed cluster strategy based on game model. The introduction of social nature with generally long-term characteristics makes clustering framework more predictive and stable.

537,537,Lightweight iterative MDS matrices: How small can we go?," All rights reserved.As perfect building blocks for the diffusion layers of many symmetric-key primitives, the construction of MDS matrices with lightweight circuits has received much attention from the symmetric-key community. One promising way of realizing low-cost MDS matrices is based on the iterative construction: a low-cost matrix becomes MDS after rising it to a certain power. To be more specific, if At is MDS, then one can implement A instead of At to achieve the MDS property at the expense of an increased latency with t clock cycles. In this work, we identify the exact lower bound of the number of nonzero blocks for a 4 × 4 block matrix to be potentially iterative-MDS. Subsequently, we show that the theoretically lightest 4 × 4 iterative MDS block matrix (whose entries or blocks are 4 × 4 binary matrices) with minimal nonzero blocks costs at least 3 XOR gates, and a concrete example achieving the 3-XOR bound is provided. Moreover, we prove that there is no hope for previous constructions (GFS, LFS, DSI, and spares DSI) to beat this bound. Since the circuit latency is another important factor, we also consider the lower bound of the number of iterations for certain iterative MDS matrices. Guided by these bounds and based on the ideas employed to identify them, we explore the design space of lightweight iterative MDS matrices with other dimensions and report on improved results. Whenever we are unable to find better results, we try to determine the bound of the optimal solution. As a result, the optimality of some previous results is proved.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1706']",26.4,0.13191609977324265,0.446485260770975,0
538,538,NRTR: A no-recurrence sequence-to-sequence model for scene text recognition,"Scene text recognition has attracted a great many researches due to its importance to various applications. Existing methods mainly adopt recurrence or convolution based networks. Though have obtained good performance, these methods still suffer from two limitations: slow training speed due to the internal recurrence of RNNs, and high complexity due to stacked convolutional layers for long-term feature extraction. This paper, for the first time, proposes a no-recurrence sequence-to-sequence text recognizer, named NRTR, that dispenses with recurrences and convolutions entirely. NRTR follows the encoder-decoder paradigm, where the encoder uses stacked self-attention to extract image features, and the decoder applies stacked self-attention to recognize texts based on encoder output. NRTR relies solely on self-attention mechanism thus could be trained with more parallelization and less complexity. Considering scene image has large variation in text and background, we further design a modality-transform block to effectively transform 2D input images to 1D sequences, combined with the encoder to extract more discriminative features. NRTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on both regular and irregular benchmarks, while requires only a small fraction of training time compared to the best model from the literature (at least 8 times faster).",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1707'],24.125,0.1663714285714286,0.44875311355311354,1

One of the key challenges in this area is how to gauge user satisfaction. In this paper, we study the impact of CPU configuration on user satisfaction and power consumption with real users. Specifically, we propose a system to save energy by altering active CPU core count and frequency while keeping users satisfied. The system utilizes user-facing metrics such as frame rate and input lag to predict user satisfaction and then configure CPU core count and frequency in real-time to maximize satisfaction while minimizing power consumption. We first study a set of applications in-the-lab and show that we can accurately model satisfaction with the collected user-facing metrics.

554,554,YanuX - Pervasive distribution of the user interface by co-located devices," Publication rights licensed to ACM.We currently live surrounded by many different computing devices. Therefore, it is important to take better advantage of those devices by coming up with smart ways of integrating and combining them. We have been exploring the possibility of building applications that present user interfaces pervasively distributed across different co-located devices. We designed the YanuX framework, which generalizes and supports the development of this new type of applications. A key issue is the automatic distribution of user interface (UI) components among co-located devices. We created the tools set needed to describe the capabilities of each of the devices present in the environment and the requirements of each of the applications' components as configured by the developers. Restrictions of the components should match the capabilities of the devices leading to a UI component distribution decision that should reflect developers' intentions and expectations of the users. Besides detailing YanuX's components, the paper also presents YouTube Viewer as a proof-of-concept application based on YanuX.

These changes have an impact on the factors leading to a harmonic relationship between strategy and information technology (IT). However, business IT alignment is not easy to achieve and maintain. Therefore, it is essential to know the scope of the impact in the complete adaptation of alignment by making the relationships of the alignment elements ready to treat change as a critical discipline by choosing to make them fluid and agile. Over the literature, the research on the factor of change and strategic alignment to make a system agile and aligned is not overly developed.

The self-disclosure involved is a privacy trade-off based on awareness, and we argue that our respondents are making an informed decision. The scenario of paying a monthly monetary sum for using Facebook if it means securing their personal data seemed to puzzle our respondents.

In this work, we proposed a new framework based on detecting the human body parts such that both Jersey Bib number and text is localized reliably. To achieve this, the proposed method first detects and localize the human in a given image using Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD). In the next step, different human body parts namely, Torso, Left Thigh, Right Thigh, that generally contain a Bib number or text region is automatically extracted. These detected individual parts are processed individually to detect the Jersey Bib number/text using a deep CNN network based on the 2-channel architecture based on the novel adaptive weighting loss function. Finally, the detected text is cropped out and fed to a CNN-RNN based deep model abbreviated as CRNN for recognizing jersey/Bib/text.

561,561,Using neuro-IS/consumer neuroscience tools to study healthy food choices: A review," Published by Elsevier B.V.Dietary choices are one of the main drivers of preventable health issues such as obesity or diabetes. Food choice is a complex behavior that is hard to measure with traditional, paper, and pencil-based methods. Neuro-Information Systems (NeuroIS) research is well suited to examine neurophysiological and psychophysiological processes behind complex food choices. This paper aims to scrutinize the feasibility of applying NeuroIS tools in healthy food research. We argue that the most important food choices are made in extra-laboratory conditions-mostly grocery stores. Thus, mobile EEG and eye-tracking seem to be the most promising research tools in this context. Surprisingly, there are only a few EEG and eye-tracking studies on healthy food choices held in extra-laboratory conditions.

562,562,A relation network based approach to curved text detection,"In this paper, a new relation network based approach to curved text detection is proposed by formulating it as a visual relationship detection problem. The key idea is to decompose curved text detection into two subproblems, namely detection of text primitives and prediction of link relationship for each nearby text primitive pair. Specifically, an anchor-free region proposal network based text detector is first used to detect text primitives of different scales from different feature maps of a feature pyramid network, from which a manageable number of text primitive pairs are selected. Then, a relation network is used to predict whether each text primitive pair belongs to a same text instance. Finally, isolated text primitives are grouped into curved text instances based on link relationships of text primitive pairs. Because pairwise link prediction has used features extracted from the bounding boxes of each text primitive and their union, the relation network can effectively leverage wider context information to improve link prediction accuracy. Furthermore, since the link relationships of relatively distant text primitives can be predicted robustly, our relation network based text detector is capable of detecting text instances with large inter-character spaces. Consequently, our proposed approach achieves superior performance on not only two public curved text detection datasets, namely Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500, but also a multi-oriented text detection dataset, namely MSRA-TD500.",60098464,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,China,['1707'],27.5,0.13337662337662337,0.5372077922077924,1

564,564,Switches know the exact amount of congestion," Publication rights licensed to ACM.Deployed congestion control algorithms rely on end hosts to figure out how congested the network is. Initially, for TCP, the congestion signal was packet drops; a binary signal that kicks in only after the congestion is well underway. More recently, the trend has been towards using RTT as a congestion signal instead (e.g. Timely and BBR). But RTT is a noisy surrogate for congestion; it contains a valuable signal about congestion at the bottleneck but also includes noise from the queuing delay at the non-bottlenecked switches. Taking a step back, it is worth asking: Why don't the switches and routers simply tell us the actual congestion they are experiencing? After all, they must keep track of the precise occupancy of their own queues anyway; they can directly tell the end-hosts. Conventional wisdom said this is too expensive (in terms of additional bits in headers, or complexity and power consumption). We argue that even if this was once the case, it no longer is. Today, it is quite feasible, with negligible increase in power or lost capacity, to report the precise queuing delay at the switches, allowing the end hosts to make more accurate decisions when minimizing required buffering. We explore how this might work using modern programmable switches and NICs that stamp each packet with the queue occupancy (or the maximum queue occupancy along the path), which can be thought of as a multi-bit ECN signal. We provide evidence that the resulting signal is a more accurate indication of congestion at the flow's bottleneck and can lead to higher link utilization and shorter flow completion times than RTT-based algorithms. Consequently, it becomes easier to control required buffer sizes. Our goal here is not to argue for a particular multi-bit ECN algorithm, but to point out that in the future, there is no longer a need to rely on noisy RTT measurements at the edges.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.53846153846154,0.1851731601731602,0.44951298701298703,0
565,565,An energy-aware dynamic data allocation mechanism for many-channel memory systems,"A modern memory system is equipped with many memory channels to obtain a high memory bandwidth. To take the advantage of this organization, applications' data are distributed among the channels and transferred in an interleaved fashion. Although memory-intensive applications benefit from a high bandwidth by many memory channels, applications such as compute-intensive ones do not need the high bandwidth. To reduce the energy consumption for such applications, the memory system has low-power modes. During no memory request, the main memory can enter these modes and reduce energy consumption. However, these applications often cause intermittent memory requests to the channels that handle their data, resulting in not entering the low-power modes. Hence, the memory system cannot enter the low-power modes even though the applications do not need the high bandwidth. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a dynamic data allocation mechanism for many-channel memory systems. This mechanism forces data of such applications to use the specified channels by dynamically changing the address-mapping schemes and migrating the data. As a result, the other channels to which the data are not allocated can have a chance to enter the low-power modes for a long time. Therefore, the proposed mechanism has the potential to reduce the energy consumption of many-channel memory systems. The evaluation results show that this mechanism can reduce the energy consumption by up to 11.8% and 1.7% on average.",60008435,Tohoku University,Sendai,Japan,"['1712', '1710', '1708', '1706', '1705', '1703']",19.083333333333332,0.10510416666666668,0.47718750000000004,1
566,566,No padding please: Efficient neural handwriting recognition,"Neural handwriting recognition (NHR) is the recognition of handwritten text with deep learning models, such as multi-dimensional long short-term memory (MDLSTM) recurrent neural networks. Models with MDLSTM layers have achieved state-of-the art results on handwritten text recognition tasks. While multi-directional MDLSTM-layers have an unbeaten ability to capture the complete context in all directions, this strength limits the possibilities for parallelization, and therefore comes at a high computational cost. In this work we develop methods to create efficient MDLSTM-based models for NHR, particularly a method aimed at eliminating computation waste that results from padding. This proposed method, called example packing, replaces wasteful stacking of padded examples with efficient tiling in a 2-dimensional grid. For word-based NHR this yields a speed improvement of factor 6.6 over an already efficient baseline of minimal padding for each batch separately. For line-based NHR the savings are more modest, but still significant. In addition to example packing, we propose: 1) a technique to optimize parallelization for dynamic graph definition frameworks including PyTorch, using convolutions with grouping, 2) a method for parallelization across GPUs for variable-length example batches. All our techniques are thoroughly tested on our own PyTorch re-implementation of MDLSTM-based NHR models. A thorough evaluation on the IAM dataset shows that our models are performing similar to earlier implementations of state-of-the art models.

However, inaccurate recognition results may cause an adverse effect on users or even an unpredictable accident. In order to improve the accuracy of human activity recognition, multi-device and deep learning based approaches have been proposed. However, they are not practical on a daily basis due to the limitations that devices are difficult to wear, and deep learning requires large training dataset and incurs expensive computational costs. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, multiscale feature engineering for human activity recognition (MFE-HAR), which exploits the properties of arm movement from global and local scales using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on a single wearable device. Our method takes advantage of having important features at multiple scales over previous single-scale methods.

With these confidence measures, we limit the inability of a retrieval list to reject certain candidates. We investigate four different approaches that are either based on the network's attribute estimations or make use of a surrogate model.

Considering the volume of data and complexity of processes, manual analysis, annotation, recognition, classification, and retrieval, of such document images is impossible. To automatically deal with such processes, many document image analysis applications exist in the literature and many of them are currently in place in different organisation and institutes. The performance of those applications are directly affected by the quality of document images.

To assess the quality of document images, this paper proposes a new full-reference DIQA method using first followed by second order Hast derivations.

An average pooling is then employed to obtain a quality score for the distorted document image. To evaluate the proposed method, two different datasets were used.

Our goal is to evaluate a student's handwritten answer by assigning an evaluation score that is comparable to the human-assigned scores. Existing works in this domain mainly focused on evaluating handwritten essays with handcrafted, non-semantic features. Our contribution is two-fold: 1) we model this problem as a self-supervised, feature-based classification problem, which can fine-tune itself for each question without any explicit supervision. 2) We introduce the usage of semantic analysis for auto-evaluation in handwritten text space using the combination of Information Retrieval and Extraction (IRE) and, Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to derive a set of useful features. We tested our method on three datasets created from various domains, using the help of students of different age groups. Experiments show that our method performs comparably to that of human evaluators.",60000163,"International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad",Hyderabad,India,['1707'],20.11111111111111,0.20265151515151517,0.45757575757575747,1

579,579,KPI-Based Approach for Business Process Improvement," Published by Elsevier B.V.Business Process Management is a contemporary approach with the main purpose of deploying, executing and continuously optimizing the different types of business processes and thus improving the agility of the organization. In this paper, we propose an approach to business process improvement based on key performance indicators during the Business Process Management lifecycle. We started by highlighting the life cycle of key performance indicators. Then our proposal was at meta-modeling level, adding performance indicators as concepts of the Business Process Model and Notation meta-model. This brought us to a new extension of this meta-model based on key performance indicators. The particular case of the Scrum agile development process is then considered as a case study. In this context, key performance indicators are proposed for this process and are classified according to the elements of the Scrum method. The proposed approach was tested by taking the example of a company using ScrumWise tool for conducting scrum developments. The developed prototype allowed a performance evaluation of the Scrum process through key performance indicators and a set of recommendations were proposed to help managing tasks and improving the adopted process.",60070316,Université de la Manouba,Manouba,Tunisia,['1700'],21.22222222222222,0.10303030303030303,0.661489898989899,0

In this context, we present a novel idea which combines Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Word2vec (providing a consistency metric regarding the partitioned topics) as potential method for limiting the 'a priori' number of cluster K usually needed in classical partitioning approaches. We proposed 2 implementations of this idea, respectively able to: (1) finding the best K for LDA in terms of topic consistency; (2) gathering the optimal clusters from different levels of clustering.

In this paper, we propose the template and instance loss functions for the relevant machine learning tasks in offline handwritten Chinese character recognition. First, the character template is designed to deal with the intrinsic similarities among Chinese characters. Second, the instance loss can reduce category variance according to classification difficulty, giving a large penalty to the outlier instance of handwritten Chinese character.

583,583,Fast method of ID documents location and type identification for mobile and server application,"In this paper we discuss the problem of simultaneous document type recognition and projective distortion parameters estimation for the images of ID documents. There are two considered cases. In the first case a video stream captured using mobile devices is processed on the device. The second case considers photos or scanned images which are processed on a server. For each case the requirements are defined for the input data and processing speed. The universal approach is proposed, which allows solving the problem in both cases. The approach is based on representing the image as a constellation of feature points and descriptors, but in order to perform more accurate distortion parameters estimation straight lines and quadrangles are extracted from the input image and used as additional features. Techniques are described which allow to combine matched feature points, lines, and quadrangles to geometric verification using RANSAC. Best alternative selection criteria are proposed along with methods of solution accuracy estimation. The differences between methods of preliminary analysis of the input image and geometric primitives location are discussed in relation to the considered problems.

585,585,Improving text image resolution using a deep generative adversarial network for optical character recognition,"Optical character recognition (OCR) has been widely studied in previous work. Except for the models used, the recognition accuracy depends most on the resolution of the image to be recognized. To enhance OCR performance, this paper proposes an approach based on a generative adversarial network to improve text image resolution. Our approach uses a perceptual loss function that consists of an adversarial loss, a content loss and an L1 loss. The adversarial loss and the L1 loss are used to ensure the generated super-resolved images are closer to the ground truth high-resolution images. Meanwhile, the content loss is used to ensure the generated super-resolved images and the input low-resolution images have similar features on the basis of perceptual instead of pixel similarity. To evaluate the proposed approach, we compare the recognition accuracies before and after improving the resolution of both English and Chinese text images. The results show that the recognition accuracies on the super-resolved text images obtained with our approach are significantly higher than those on the low-resolution images without processing.",60029380,Inner Mongolia University China,Hohhot,China,['1707'],21.5,0.06904761904761905,0.28095238095238095,1
586,586,A new approach for integrated recognition and correction of texts from images,"Automatic recognition and error correction of texts from images are critical for many commercial applications such as receipt recognition, which have very high accuracy requirements. In this paper we propose an integrated image based text recognition and correction approach to improve accuracy. There are two levels of text recognition and correction integration in the proposed approach. Firstly, a beam search strategy is designed to generate a set of text candidates, based on the probability distribution of text prediction outcomes from a deep learning recognition model. Then a word-level lexicon check is applied to select only one from the candidate text sentences, which has the highest prediction probability among those with all words present in the lexicon. Jointly the beam search and lexicon check can effectively correct some recognition errors. Secondly, an encoder-decoder language model based corrector is developed to correct potential recognition errors in the selected output texts that fail the lexicon check. Training samples for the corrector are created from the recognition outcomes and can be expanded by associating multiple text candidates with one image label. We conduct experiments on ICDAR'13 and CH10K datasets to evaluate the proposed approach and the impact of these two levels of integration on accuracy. Experiment results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing one with higher recall and much higher recognition accuracy through effective exploitation of joint recognition and correction design.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,['1707'],22.9,0.12544444444444444,0.46862962962962956,1

The information related to Patient is sent by means of WBAN (Wireless Body Area Network) and sensors to the healthcare database. This has been shown a great potential to transmit vital parameter of the patient at a remote location. Remote monitoring of patient(s), including vital signs, sound and video is to be transmitted, particularly when a patient is in transit. By transmitting the imperative parameters of the patient to a specialist diminishes, the ideal opportunity for starting treatment and permits the emergency crew to be better prepared. This will facilitate a doctor to make a diagnostic conclusion. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to develop an advance system to transmit the vital parameters of the patient to the smart phone of the doctor at a remote location. After seeing essential parameters of the patient, the specialist can convey/endorse the medication from the remote area. METHODS: To monitor patient’s data in real-time an android application is developed which helps the medical staff to monitor the patient from remote location. All the patient related information is stored in Real Time Clinical Database. RESULTS: The proposed model will allow the doctors to monitor physiological parameters (HR, NIBP, Temp, ECG, SPO2) of the patient, as well as endorse medication from the remote location.

Firstly, one of the biggest challenges is obtaining sufficient amounts of high quality training data. We address the problem by using online handwriting data collected for a large scale production online handwriting recognition system. We describe our image data generation pipeline and study how online data can be used to build HTR models. We show that the data improve the models significantly under the condition where only a small number of real images is available, which is usually the case for HTR models. It enables us to support a new script at substantially lower cost. Secondly, we propose a line recognition model based on neural networks without recurrent connections.

Fortunately, early detection and proper treatment can control the development of glaucoma and in turn limit further progression of associated visual impairments. However, periodic manual diagnosis of glaucoma necessary for its early diagnosis would require abundancy of experts, besides being invasive, expensive, and time consuming. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) can thus serve as a game changer in the early detection of glaucoma by bringing clinician to the level of an expert. Moreover, CAD has the advantages of being non-invasive, simple, and cost effective. In this work, an automated generic glaucoma detection algorithm is presented in which statistical and textural features are computed from the optic nerve head (ONH) region within retinal images. Several analyses are performed to compare glaucoma classification performance considering different contrast enhancement techniques (histogram equalization - contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization) and color models (RGB - HSV - CIELAB). Feature selection is then used to find the best set of features for each of the different experiments. Best performance was achieved when textural features were computed from the histogram equalized CIELAB channels, resulting in an accuracy of 92.5%, sensitivity of 95.0%, and specificity of 90.0% considering a public dataset consisting of 40 glaucomatous and 40 healthy retinal images.",60022915,Misr International University,Cairo,Egypt,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.333333333333332,0.10559006211180125,0.3202898550724637,1

605,605,Breaking the code on broken tablets: The learning challenge for annotated cuneiform script in normalized 2D and 3D datasets,"The number of known cuneiform tablets is assumed to be in the hundreds of thousands. The Hilprecht Archive Online contains 1977 high-resolution 3D scans of tablets. The online cuneiform database CDLI catalogs metadata for more than 100.000 tablets. While both are accessible publicly, large-scale machine learning and pattern recognition on cuneiform tablets remain elusive. The data is only accessible by searching web pages, the tablet identifiers between collections are inconsistent, and the 3D data is unprepared and challenging for automated processing. We pave the way for large-scale analyses of cuneiform tablets by assembling a cross-referenced benchmark dataset of processed cuneiform tablets: (i) frontally aligned 3D tablets with pre-computed high-dimensional surface features, (ii) six-views raster images for off-the-shelf image processing, and (iii) metadata, transcriptions, and transliterations, for a subset of 707 tablets, for learning alignment between 3D data, image and linguistic expression. This is the first dataset of its kind and of its size in cuneiform research.

606,606,The Relation between Student Behaviours in Group Presentations and their Teamwork Modalities Using Belbin and MBTI Analysis," Published by Elsevier B.V.This research paper aims to investigate the relationship between learners' profiles as analysed according to MBTI and Belbin and their behaviour during group presentations while not being the active presenter. This paper is part of a research study in the field of video tagging as a mechanism for analysing individual behaviour in learning activities. As part of this study, the authors analysed videos of student group presentation and associated behavioural patterns to individual student profiles as produced by the Belbin and MBTI analysis models. The aim of the study was to identify how social and teamwork characteristics of individual learners can relate to certain behaviours. Such relations would help to better assess video content of learning activities including meetings and presentations. A primary aim of the study is to identify associations between human behaviour and individual's teamwork characteristics. Such associations could facilitate the judgment of learners' ability to work in a team. The study included quantitative research methods for analysing videos in combination with personality profiling analysis, with emphasis on social and teamwork activities. The Belbin and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) models were used for the purpose of this study. Furthermore, the behavioural patterns monitored during the video analysis included 'eye contact with presenter' and 'eye focus out' as the most prominent observable behaviours. The paper's conclusion is that based on the analysis results, learners classified as Coordinators (Belbin) or Virtuosos (MBTI) are less likely to lose focus while they are not presenting, and students classified as Monitor Evaluators (Belbin) or Logisticians (MBTI) are more likely to look and take care of their team members while presenting.",60014105,Middlesex University,London,United Kingdom,['1700'],24.636363636363637,0.12531328320802002,0.4774436090225564,0

Hence, data science solutions are in demand to data mine these big data for valuable information and useful knowledge embedded in these big data in order to transform this information and knowledge into recommendations and actions. In particular, recommendation systems (RecSys or RS) - -which are tools that can provide suggestions to users based on various metrics - -have been playing an important role in society since the booming of the Internet. Making more accurate predictions can both potentially increase company revenue and enhance user experience. So, it has been a hot topic. More specifically, collaborative filtering (CF) has been a popular technique applied in RS. The key ideas behind most of the CF algorithms are to filter items based on other users' opinions. Since the recommendation process is based on user interactions, one of the challenges is how to prevent shilling attacks (or shilling attack ratings). In this paper, we propose methods to integrate users' rating entropy into collaborative filtering so as to defend shilling attacks and reduce noisy ratings, and thus achieve higher prediction accuracy. Evaluation results show the effectiveness of our cognitive-based hybrid collaborative filtering methods in rating scaling on entropy for defending shilling influence.",60020261,Università della Calabria,Cosenza,Italy,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.1,0.17280303030303032,0.5378030303030303,1

The quality of patient identification prevents misidentifications and lack of information. Methods: In this work we used an integration engine to receive, process and route HL7 messages. By analysing these messages, we can provide the means to overcome the heterogeneity present in existing health information systems data models and architecture. The aim of this work was to create a validation solution for patient identification using HL7 messages as source. The solution accepts a patient name and returns information about their quality. Results: A total of 1.048.576 messages were gathered and processed by the solution. The performed tests identified erroneous patient names (n=40.699) and also systematic errors caused by some health information systems. It also provided a method to increase the visibility of these problems, and act accordingly to correct them. Discussion: In a production environment, the tests performed confirmed the solution's ability to identify common errors that happen across communications in a health institution network.

613,613,Saving private addresses: An analysis of privacy issues in the bluetooth-low-energy advertising mechanism,"The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol is being included in a growing number of connected objects such as fitness trackers and headphones. As part of the service discovery mechanism of BLE, devices announce themselves by broadcasting radio signals called advertisement packets that can be collected with off-the-shelf hardware and software. To avoid the risk of tracking based on those messages, BLE features an address randomization mechanism that substitutes the device address with random temporary pseudonyms, called Private addresses. In this paper, we analyze the privacy issues associated with the advertising mechanism of BLE, leveraging a large dataset of advertisement packets collected in the wild. First, we identified that some implementations fail at following the BLE specifications on the maximum lifetime and the uniform distribution of random identifiers. Furthermore, we found that the payload of the advertisement packet can hamper the randomization mechanism by exposing counters and static identifiers. In particular, we discovered that advertising data of Apple and Microsoft proximity protocols can be used to defeat the address randomization scheme. Finally, we discuss how some elements of advertising data can be leveraged to identify the type of device, exposing the owner to inventory attacks.",60016253,Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon,Villeurbanne,France,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.25,-0.0206959706959707,0.4592490842490842,1

Thus, motion sensors are used to enable patients' interaction with a PREG. Leap Motion is a motion sensor that may be useful for developing PREGs targeted at hands and fingers rehabilitation. Knowing the advantages and limitations of Leap Motion may be relevant for developers to understand under which conditions or in which cases this sensor may be suitable. In this paper, we present a qualitative study, which included a series of interviews with a group of PREGs developers and a physiotherapist, to identify the main advantages and limitations of Leap Motion for developing PREGs. We employed Thematic Analysis to analyse the collected data. We found that the limitations and advantages of Leap Motion are related to technology maturity, and characteristics as development and/or rehabilitation tool. The findings showed that Leap Motion is suitable for developing comfortable PREGs for some hand and fingers rehabilitation movements with a moderate development effort.

The latter category achieves remarkable detection results on arbitraryorientation and large aspect ratios of scene texts based on instance segmentation algorithms. However, due to the lack of context information with consideration of scene text unique characteristics, directly applying instance segmentation to text detection task is prone to result in low accuracy, especially producing false positive detection results. To ease this problem, we propose a novel text-context-aware scene text detection CNN structure, which appropriately encodes channel and spatial attention information to construct context-aware and discriminative feature map for multi-oriented and multi-language text detection tasks. With high representation ability of textcontext-aware feature map, the proposed instance segmentation based method can not only robustly detect multi-oriented and multi-language text from natural scene images, but also produce better text detection results by greatly reducing false positives.

626,626,Understanding the input-output transfer function of cortical neurons," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.We aim to understand how brain circuits, learn, memorize or process information. To achieve this aim, we follow a bottomup approach by focusing on single neurons from rat brains and study how different synaptic inputs of a single neuron translate to an output or an action potential. We have custom-built a unique two-photon laser microscope that incorporates a holographic projector, which transforms the incident laser into multiple foci at the sample volume. The hologram is programmable so we can position the different foci anywhere around the neuron in 3D. Each focus can be used to trigger a synaptic input or used as an optical probe to record the activity of the neuron. We can therefore stimulate and probe the activity from multiple locations within the neuron's dendritic tree using light. For triggering inputs, a focal stimulation represents a synaptic input via two-photon photolysis of caged neurotransmitters. For recording, a laser focus excites a calcium indicator that changes in fluorescence whenever the neuron is active. Using these techniques, we have now identified a novel function of a specific set of dendrites that can have a significant role in learning and memory. The set of dendrites we are probing are currently unexplored due to their very thin morphology. We were able to observe unique properties that allow these dendrites to be more receptive to inputs whenever the neuron fires a series of action potentials. Hence, they have a functional role in the brain's capacity to learn and memorize.",60008950,Australian National University,Canberra,Australia,['1706'],21.333333333333332,0.08589569160997733,0.4918367346938775,0

629,629,Non-functional requirement patterns for agile software development,"Following the agile principles, agile software development is popular among software developing organizations. The attractive characteristics of agile development are that it embraces frequent changes and that it gives high priority to users. Due to such characteristics, non-functional requirements are usually not identified in the requirements elicitation process. They are often neglected in an early phase, and even overlooked in the later stages of software development. This results in poor quality software. To enhance non-functional requirements identification in agile development, this paper proposes a development of a set of non-functional requirement patterns in the form of requirement templates for agile development. The set is composed of 10 security requirement patterns and 13 fault tolerance requirement patterns, which are derived from an analysis of security and fault tolerance design patterns. The proposed non-functional requirement patterns can facilitate non-functional requirements gathering and help agile team members in writing the requirements.

Dolf Technologies is a business located in Saudi Arabia with their headquarters in Khobar. The company has several challenges concerning project management. These challenges are influencing the quality and the punctuality of the delivered tasks. One effective way to deal with such a problem is to monitor all these tasks in an effective way. This paper reports on the case of employing performance dashboards by DOLF Technologies. The suggested solution consists of two dashboards, one is destined to operational control level employees and the second is dedicated to strategic level management. Both dashboards are designed using Tableau software connected to online excel sheet where the company data is stored. The first solution is the operational dashboard displays the progress of each task in each subproject, colored by if the task is on time or overdue. Moreover, working hours left compared with the deadline. As well as, the overall progress of each subproject displayed by how much it is finished in percentage out of 100. The second solution is the managerial dashboard an abstraction of the operational dashboard. It shows vertical progress bars; each visualizes the frequency of delays in tasks that each sub-project has. In addition, pie charts show the percentage of completed tasks for each subproject.

631,631,ReS2TIM: Reconstruct syntactic structures from table images,"Tables often represent densely packed but structured data. Understanding table semantics is vital for effective information retrieval and data mining. Unlike web tables, whose semantics are readable directly from markup language and contents, the full analysis of tables published as images requires the conversion of discrete data into structured information. This paper presents a novel framework to convert a table image into its syntactic representation through the relationships between its cells. In order to reconstruct the syntactic structures of a table, we build a cell relationship network to predict the neighbors of each cell in four directions. During the training stage, a distance-based sample weight is proposed to handle the class imbalance problem. According to the detected relationships, the table is represented by a weighted graph that is then employed to infer the basic syntactic table structure. Experimental evaluation of the proposed framework using two datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our model for cell relationship detection and table structure inference.",60025709,The University of Sydney,Sydney,Australia,['1707'],20.0,0.20833333333333334,0.44583333333333336,1
632,632,A cost efficient approach to correct OCR errors in large document collections,"Word error rate of an OCR is often higher than its character error rate. This is especially true when OCRs are designed by recognizing characters. High word accuracies are critical for many practical applications like content creation and text-to-speech systems. In order to detect and correct the misrecognised words, it is common for an OCR to employ a post-processor module to improve the word accuracy. However, conventional approaches to post-processing like looking up a dictionary or using a statistical language model (SLM), are still limited. In many such scenarios, it is often required to remove the outstanding errors manually. We observe that the traditional post-processing schemes look at error words sequentially, since OCRs process documents one at a time. We propose a cost-efficient model to address the error words in batches rather than correcting them individually. We exploit the fact that a collection of documents (eg. a book), unlike a single document, has a structure leading to repetition of words. Such words, if efficiently grouped together and corrected together, can lead to a significant reduction in the effort. Error correction can be fully automatic or with a human in the loop. We compare the performance of our method with various baseline approaches including the case where all the errors are removed by a human. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solution empirically by reporting more than 70% reduction in the human effort with near perfect error correction. We validate our method on books in both English and Hind.",60000163,"International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad",Hyderabad,India,['1707'],16.53333333333333,0.16397142857142857,0.4701714285714285,1

The ability to quantify these dynamic events in micro and nanoscale in real-Time at the same time contributes to our understanding of the functional response of living cells. The combination to achieve both microscale and nanoscale imaging simultaneous at volumetric speeds is challenging. Traditional TIRF microscopy has excelled in measuring surface interaction but yet limited in imaging depth and requires fluorescent labelling. Likewise, the ability to quantify the total volume and shape change of biological cells as they interact requires either confocal microscopy or lightsheet microscopy.

639,639,Parameter-free table detection method,"In this paper, we propose two parameter-free table detection methods: one for the closed tables and other for open tables. The unifying idea is multigaussian analysis. Multigaussian analysis of text height histograms classifies the document content into text and non-text blocks. Closed tables are classified as non-text and their identification from the non-text blocks is similar to many earlier methods that remove the separators. We do not need any parameters to identify rows and columns and discriminate them from text blocks because of multigaussian analysis. Open tables are initially classified as text blocks and are detected by extending the multigaussian analysis to the heights and widths of text blocks. The text-blocks are grouped into three categories by multigaussian analysis. These groups are used to classify table cells and distinguish them from text blocks. Table blocks are merged to obtain the table region. Evaluation on various Indic script newspapers and ICDAR2013 table competition dataset shows that our methods achieve more than 90% in table recognition. The strength of our algorithm is that it is a parameter-free approach and requires no training dataset.",60029516,University of Hyderabad,Hyderabad,India,['1707'],16.454545454545453,0.06136363636363637,0.3613636363636364,1

This technology emerged in the information field in recent years. It is a data storage technology that combines routing and coding to improve transmission efficiency by additionally encoding data at intermediate nodes[1]. This kind of new technology is able to enhance data throughput, cut down node energy consumption, and achieve energy balance by utilizing the inherent spatial diversity and data redundancy features of WSN. Routing protocol is an important technology in the design of wireless sensor networks. Aiming at the traditional directed diffusion routing protocol (DD), this paper analyzes the problem that the original protocol costs too much in energy and time, and proposes an efficient and energysaving improved directed diffusion routing protocol NC-DD (Network Coding-DD). This protocol solves the problem of excessive energy consumption when the node works caused by a improper forwarding strategy in the original protocol.

641,641,Shark smell optimization (SSO) algorithm for cloud jobs scheduling,"Cloud computing is an emerging technology based on moving the computing operations from the desktop computers to cloud providers through the internet. Typically, cloud providers on the internet process huge number of computing requests or jobs from enormous clients. Jobs scheduling in cloud computing is considered a crucial issue needs to be tackled. There are several methods available for jobs scheduling on cloud computing. However, there is a need for new mechanisms to reduce the job execution time and improve scheduling job process. This paper proposed a new job scheduling mechanism based on Shark Smell Optimization (SSO) algorithm. The proposed mechanism of job scheduling aims to find an efficient distribution of jobs based on SSO to mimic the behavior of sharks in the hunt wounded fish. Scheduling job in the proposed mechanism creates at first set of functions and resources to generate blood points by assigning jobs to resources randomly and assessing the blood points to find the place of a large amount blood points. The second phase repeats the regeneration of blood points based on the behavior of sharks to produce the best schedule for the jobs is that has the minimum execution time for jobs. Two experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed mechanism. The first stage of the evaluation process is a simple implementation scenarios using Java language. The second stage was a full simulation using CloudSim simulator toolkit. Several experiments scenarios using different numbers of jobs and resources are conducted.

642,642,MMLOC: Multi-mode indoor localization system based on smart access points,"Indoor localization based on Wi-Fi fingerprints has been an active research topic for years. However, existing approaches do not consider the instability of access points (APs) which may be unreliable in practice, particularly the ones deployed by individual users. This instability impacts the localization accuracy severely, due to the unreliable or even wrong Wi-Fi fingerprints. Ideally, the localization should be done using only the well-deployed APs (e.g., deployed by facility teams). However, in many places the number of these APs is too few to achieve a good localization accuracy. To solve this problem, we leverage emerging smart APs equipped with multi-mode antennas, and build a new indoor localization system called MMLOC to reduce the number of necessary APs. The key idea is controlling the modes of AP antennas to generate more fingerprints with fewer APs. A clustering based localization strategy is designed to enable a mobile terminal to figure out the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) for different antenna modes without requiring any synchronization. We have implemented a prototype system using smart APs and commercial smartphones. Experimental results demonstrate that MMLOC can reduce the number of necessary APs by 50%, and achieve the same or even better localization accuracy.",60000745,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Urbana,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",19.9,0.13514856355765448,0.5760724124360488,1

Software companies provide customer care service or customer support to handle such issues or problems which sometimes can be resolved right away and sometimes have to be forwarded to responsible persons. Efficiency of problem handling is very important to software companies to maintain customer satisfaction. This paper reports a case of a software company in Thailand whose derivatives trading software is used by a large number of broker companies and their customers. The software company has experienced problems where the reported software problems are classified incorrectly and hence are directed to the wrong persons and have to be reclassified. Assigning the problem reports to the responsible persons in a timely and correct manner is crucial especially for the nature of the trading software. This paper presents a multiclass classification method to classify 11 problem report types that are found in this trading software.

Identifying and deciphering oracle bone scripts is one of the most important topics in oracle bone study and requires a deep familiarity with the culture of ancient China. This task remains very challenging for two reasons. The first is that it is executed mainly by humans and requires a high level of experience, aptitude, and commitment. The second is due to the scarcity of domain-specific data, which hinders the advancement of automatic recognition research. A collection of well-labeled oracle-bone data is necessary to bridge the oracle bone and information processing fields; however, such a dataset has not yet been presented. Hence, in this paper, we construct a new large-scale dataset of oracle bone characters called OBC306. We also present the standard deep convolutional neural network-based evaluation for this dataset to serve as a benchmark. Through statistical and visual analyses, we describe the inherent difficulties of oracle bone recognition and propose future challenges for and extensions of oracle bone study using information processing.

654,654,Detecting malicious applications using system services request behavior,"Widespread growth in Android malware stimulates security researchers to propose different methods for analyzing and detecting malicious behaviors in applications. Nevertheless, current solutions are ill-suited to extract the fine-grained behavior of Android applications accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose ServiceMonitor, a lightweight host-based detection system that dynamically detects malicious applications directly on mobile devices. ServiceMonitor reconstructs the fine-grained behavior of applications based on their interaction with system services (i.e. SMS manager, camera, wifi networking, etc).

656,656,TBM-App: A clinical decision support system for tuberculous meningitis," Published by Elsevier B.V.Tuberculosis (TB) was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2017 and it is the deadliest among the infectious diseases, killing more than Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) related diseases. One of the most lethal forms of this disease is the central nervous system TB. The clinical and microbiological diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is still a challenge and to standardize the diagnosis and offer more reliable information to the decision-making process in the clinical practice, predictive scores were created and adapted for the Brazilian context. The score implementation will require staff training but has the potential to reduce time to the TBM diagnosis and therefore start correct treatment early. Although, there is a need to increase the access to the score and to facilitate its use among physicians to save time and resources. This study shows the design and development of a multiplatform mobile application to calculate the predictive score for tuberculous meningitis, in order to support clinical decisions.

658,658,Age estimation using disconnectedness features in handwriting,"Real-time applications of handwriting analysis have increased drastically in the fields of forensic and information security because of accurate cues. One of such applications is human age estimation based on handwriting for the purpose of immigrant checking. In this paper, we have proposed a new method for age estimation using handwriting analysis using Hu invariant moments and disconnectedness features. To make the proposed method robust to both ruled and un-ruled documents, we propose to explore intersection point detection in Canny edge images of each input document, which results in text components. For each text component pair, we propose Hu invariant moments for extracting disconnectedness features, which in fact measure multi-shape components based on distance, shape and mutual position analysis of components. Furthermore, iterative k-means clustering is proposed for the classification of different age groups. Experimental results on our dataset and some standard datasets, namely, IAM and KHATT, show that the proposed method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,['1707'],22.714285714285715,0.15454545454545454,0.43598484848484853,1

A single-carrier transmission system that does not employ equalization, but only uses forward error correction is considered. The channel models were obtained from measurements done in a novel way in a conference room in which non-line-of-sight scenarios are created through a human-sized blocking object, and in which beamformiug is applied at the receiver to track and obtain reflected paths. By deploying beamformiug antennas and then switching to the best path when the LoS path is cut, it was found through measurements and models that very low delay spreads could be achieved. As a result, not only the new channel models are verified, but the proposed model could replicate the measured channel with narrow antenna beamwidth together with beam hacking and switching. The low delay spread performance could lead to low-power consuming devices and multi-gigabits-per-second transmission by a single earner with simple FEC.",60104488,Istanbul Medipol Universitesi,Istanbul,Turkey,"['1711', '1708', '1705']",24.428571428571427,0.10316017316017319,0.47493073593073587,1
660,660,CNN-BLSTM-CRF network for semantic labeling of students' online handwritten assignments,"Automatic semantic labeling of strokes in online handwritten documents is a crucial task for many applications such as diagram interpretation, text recognition, and search. We formulate this task as a stroke classification problem in which each stroke is classified as a cross-out, free body diagram, or text. Separating free body diagram and text in this work is different than the traditional text/non-text separation problem because these two classes contain both text and graphics. The text class includes textual notes, mathematical symbols/equations, and graphics such as arrows that connect other elements. The free body diagram class also contains graphics and various alphanumeric characters and symbols that mark or explain the graphical objects. In this work, we present a novel deep neural network model for classification of strokes in online handwritten documents. There are two input sequences to the network. The first sequence contains the trajectories of the pen strokes while the second contains features of the strokes. Each of these sequences is fed to its own CNN-BLSTM channel to extract features and encode relationships between nearby strokes. The output of the two channels is concatenated and used as the input to a CRF layer that predicts the best sequence of labels for given input sequences.

661,661,SCARF: A scalable data management framework for context-aware applications in smart environments,"This paper proposes a context data management framework for efficient context data collection and evaluation to support context-aware applications. The proposed framework named SCARF leverages two architectures: a server-based centralized architecture and an edge-based architecture to address the problem of scalability of context collection and evaluation. SCARF collects the context data efficiently from resource constrained mobile/edge and multiple in-situ sensors (not resource constrained) deployed in smart environments. In particular, SCARF takes a set of contextual queries from applications and optimizes the rate at which the context data needs to be collected and/or transmitted from the sensor to the server. Furthermore, SCARF decides whether the code for evaluating context should be executed on the server or on the edge. Execution on the edge will result in reduced communication between the server and the edge but can result in low performance due to resource constraints of the edge. On the other hand, evaluation of context on the server, will require SCARF to transmit sensor data from the sensor to the server but can result in high performance due to high resource availability of the server. SCARF is an adaptive framework which generates an optimal context acquisition plan and a context evaluation plan such that the overall latency is minimized.",60007278,"University of California, Irvine",Irvine,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",25.875,0.029632034632034635,0.36192640692640693,1

The study also raised the distribution of AI application in HR topics and the incidence in each of these themes.

663,663,DeepTabStR: Deep learning based table structure recognition,"This paper presents a novel method for the analysis of tabular structures in document images using the potential of deformable convolutional networks. In order to assess the suitability of the model to the task of table structure recognition, most of the prior methods have been tested on the smaller ICDAR-13 table structure recognition dataset comprising of just 156 tables. We curated a new image-based table structure recognition dataset, TabStructDB2, comprising of 1081 tables densely labeled with row and column information. Instead of collecting new images for this purpose, we leveraged the famous Page-Object Detection dataset from ICDAR-17, and added structural information for all the tabular regions present in the dataset. This new publicly available dataset will enable the development of more sophisticated table structure recognition techniques in the future. We performed extensive evaluation on the two datasets (ICDAR-13 and TabStructDB) including crossdataset testing in order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach. We achieved state-of-the-art results with deformable models on ICDAR-13 with an average F-Measure of 92.98% (89.42% for rows and 96.55% for columns) and report baseline results on TabStructDB for guiding future research efforts with an F-Measure of 93.72% (91.26% for rows and 95.59% for columns).

664,664,MTRNet: A generic scene text eraser,"Text removal algorithms have been proposed for uni-lingual scripts with regular shapes and layouts. However, to the best of our knowledge, a generic text removal method which is able to remove all or user-specified text regions regardless of font, script, language or shape is not available. Developing such a generic text eraser for real scenes is a challenging task, since it inherits all the challenges of multi-lingual and curved text detection and inpainting. To fill this gap, we propose a mask-based text removal network (MTRNet). MTRNet is a conditional adversarial generative network (cGAN) with an auxiliary mask. The introduced auxiliary mask not only makes the cGAN a generic text eraser, but also enables stable training and early convergence on a challenging large-scale synthetic dataset, initially proposed for text detection in real scenes. What's more, MTRNet achieves state-of-the-art results on several real-world datasets including ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2017 MLT, and CTW1500, without being explicitly trained on this data, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods trained directly on these datasets.",60011019,Queensland University of Technology QUT,Brisbane,Australia,['1707'],23.714285714285715,0.17017543859649126,0.3615047233468286,1
665,665,Patch aggregator for scene text script identification,"Script identification in the wild is of great importance in a multi-lingual robust-reading system. The scripts deriving from the same language family share a large set of characters, which makes script identification a fine-grained classification problem. Most existing methods make efforts to learn a single representation that combines the local features by making a weighted average or other clustering methods, which may reduce the discriminatory power of some important parts in each script for the interference of redundant features. In this paper, we present a novel module named Patch Aggregator (PA), which learns a more discriminative representation for script identification by taking into account the prediction scores of local patches. Specifically, we design a CNN-based method consisting of a standard CNN classifier and a PA module. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed PA module brings significant performance improvements over the baseline CNN model, achieving the state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets for script identification: SIW-13, CVSI 2015 and RRC-MLT 2017.",60025761,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Wuhan,China,['1707'],26.5,0.14642857142857146,0.36049107142857145,1
666,666,{P}Net: Privacy-preserving personalization of AI-based models by anonymous inter-person similarity networks,"Emerging proactive applications need user data to power their underlying AI algorithms. However, both the training and inference tasks are typically performed in the provider's cloud, leading to multiple privacy issues to the data subject. Current privacy-preserving concepts are neither practicable for AI algorithms nor promise mutual benefits for both parties. To address these issues, we propose {P}Net-a novel two-level approach for privacy-preserving personalization, which exploits 'divisible' AI algorithms and anonymous inter-person similarity measurements. In short, {P}Net splits the training task into a cloud-based general model learning process and 'local' personalization steps in which the general 'black-box' model is subsequently adapted to individuals (level1). Based on anonymously-contributed model modifications (patches) resulting from the first level, {P}Net further allows new users to request a community model-representing the general model personalized by crowd-sourced patches from other similar users (level2). Our experiments show that {P}Net outperforms existing techniques especially when only a few user data is labeled.

We calculate the vertex v-score using its t-score and l-score quantifying its distance from being an absolute link in a line. In a greedy manner we classify each edge in the graph either a link, a bridge or a conflict edge. We merge every two edges classified as link together, then we merge the conflict edges next. Finally we remove the bridge edges from the graph generating the final form of the graph. Each edge in the graph equals to one extracted line.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework where the probability of text areas is inferred through a multi-resolutional attention model, which is consequently fed into a convolutional conditional random field (ConvCRF) to obtain the final binarized document image. In the proposed approach, the features of degraded document image are learned by neural networks and the relations between text areas and backgrounds are inferred by ConvCRF, which avoids the dependence of domain knowledge from researchers and has more generalization capabilities.

In order to generating the corresponding sequence of frames, each word image should be normalized into the same sizes in advance. And then, each word image is segmented into several fragments with equal size along writing direction. The output of the proposed model is a sequence of letters. To be specific, the proposed model contains three parts: an encoder, a decoder and an attention network. The encoder consists of a deep neural network and a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). The decoder consists of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a softmax layer.

For an image of dimensions H × W, we predict a single column for the rows (ŷ-row H) and a predict a single row for the columns (ŷ-row W). We use a dual-headed architecture where initial feature maps (from the encoder-decoder model) are shared while the last two layers generate class specific (row/column) predictions. This allows us to generate predictions using a single model for both rows and columns simultaneously, where previous methods relied on two separate models for inference.

Most human embryos are mosaic for chromosome abnormalities: containing cells that are euploid (normal) and aneuploid (incorrect number of chromosomes). Currently, a cell biopsy is used in IVF clinics to diagnose aneuploidy in the embryo but this does not provide a diagnosis of how many cells are aneuploid in the entire embryo. Hence, the development of a non-invasive tool to determine the proportion of aneuploid cells would likely improve IVF success. Aneuploidy in human embryos leads to altered metabolism. The co-factors utilized in cellular metabolism are autofluorescent and can be used to predict the metabolic state of cells. Here we used hyperspectral imaging to noninvasively assess intracellular fluorophores and thus metabolism. In this study, we utilized a powerful model of embryo aneuploidy where we generate mouse embryos with differing ratios of euploid:aneuploid cells. We also used primary human fibroblast cells with known aneuploidies to make comparison with euploid cells. Hyperspectral imaging of 1:3 chimeric embryos showed a distinct spectral profile compare to the control/normal embryos. The abundance of FAD in the inner cell mass (cells that form the fetus) of euploid and aneuploid blastocysts was strikingly different. For human cell lines, we were able to clearly distinguish between euploid and aneuploid with different karyotypes. These data show hyperspectral imaging is able to distinguish cells based on their ploidy status making it a promising tool in assessing embryo mosaicism.",60009512,The University of Adelaide,Adelaide,Australia,['1706'],19.76923076923077,0.16180555555555556,0.4059027777777777,0

680,680,Content extraction from lecture video via speaker action classification based on pose information,"Online lecture videos are increasingly important e-learning materials for students. Automated content extraction from lecture videos facilitates information retrieval applications that improve access to the lecture material. A significant number of lecture videos include the speaker in the image. Speakers perform various semantically meaningful actions during the process of teaching. Among all the movements of the speaker, key actions such as writing or erasing potentially indicate important features directly related to the lecture content. In this paper, we present a methodology for lecture video content extraction using the speaker actions. Each lecture video is divided into small temporal units called action segments. Using a pose estimator, body and hands skeleton data are extracted and used to compute motion-based features describing each action segment. Then, the dominant speaker action of each of these segments is classified using Random forests and the motion-based features. With the temporal and spatial range of these actions, we implement an alternative way to draw key-frames of handwritten content from the video. In addition, for our fixed camera videos, we also use the skeleton data to compute a mask of the speaker writing locations for the subtraction of the background noise from the binarized key-frames. Our method has been tested on a publicly available lecture video dataset, and it shows reasonable recall and precision results, with a very good compression ratio which is better than previous methods based on content analysis.",60032083,"University at Buffalo, The State University of New York",Buffalo,United States,['1707'],19.5,0.15087301587301588,0.5057936507936507,1
681,681,DeepSignCX: Signature complexity detection using recurrent neural networks,"This paper proposes a novel approach for on-line signature complexity detection based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Complexity of handwritten signatures can vary from very simple ones (just a simple flourish) to very complex signatures (including the handwritten full name and complex flourish). Three different complexity levels are proposed: low, medium, and high. Time functions are extracted from the on-line signatures and a system based on RNNs (BLSTM in particular) is trained to classify the three levels of complexity over a ground truth manually labelled database (BiosecurID with 400 subjects). This initial model is used to automatically label a very large database (DeepSignDB) containing over 1500 subjects, which is then used to train the proposed RNN for signature complexity detection. Promising results ca. 85% of accuracy are achieved. This complexity detector could be used as a first stage in a signature verification system in order to train a specific biometric system per signature complexity level and improve the overall system performance.",60026796,Universidad Autónoma de Madrid,Madrid,Spain,['1707'],20.125,0.04768253968253968,0.37201587301587297,1
682,682,Weak keys in the rekeying paradigm: Application to comet and mixfeed," All rights reserved.In this paper, we study a group of AEAD schemes that use rekeying as a technique to increase efficiency by reducing the state size of the algorithm. We provide a unified model to study the behavior of the keys used in these schemes, called Rekey-and-Chain (RaC). This model helps understand the design of several AEAD schemes. We show generic attacks on these schemes based on the existence of certain types of weak keys. We also show that the borderline between multi-key and single-key analyses of these schemes is not solid and the analysis can be performed independent of the master key, leading sometimes to practical attacks in the multi-key setting. More importantly, the multi-key analysis can be applied in the single key setting, since each message is encrypted with a different key. Consequently, we show gaps in the security analysis of COMET and mixFeed in the single key setting, which led the designers to provide overly optimistic security claims. In the case of COMET, full key recovery can be performed with 264 online queries and 264 offline queries in the single-key setting, or 246 online queries per user and 264 offline queries in the multi-key setting with ∼ 0.5 million users. In the case of mixFeed, we enhance the forgery adversarial advantage in the single-key setting with a factor of 267 compared to what the designers claim. More importantly, our result is just a lower bound of this advantage, since we show that the gap in the analysis of mixFeed depends on properties of the AES Key Schedule that are not well understood and require more cryptanalytic efforts to find a more tight advantage. After reporting these findings, the designers updated their security analyses and accommodated the proposed attacks.",60095095,School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1706']",26.545454545454547,0.11599378881987579,0.577639751552795,0
683,683,Offline signature verification using structural dynamic time warping,"In recent years, different approaches for handwriting recognition that are based on graph representations have been proposed (e.g. graph-based keyword spotting or signature verification). This trend is mostly due to the availability of novel fast graph matching algorithms, as well as the inherent flexibility and expressivity of graph data structures when compared to vectorial representations. That is, graphs are able to directly adapt their size and structure to the size and complexity of the respective handwritten entities. However, the vast majority of the proposed approaches match the graphs from a global perspective only. In the present paper, we propose to match the underlying graphs from different local perspectives and combine the resulting assignments by means of Dynamic Time Warping. Moreover, we show that the proposed approach can be readily combined with global matchings. In an experimental evaluation, we employ the novel method in a signature verification scenario on two widely used benchmark datasets. On both datasets, we empirically confirm that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with respect to both accuracy and runtime.",60024631,University of Fribourg,Fribourg,Switzerland,['1707'],19.22222222222222,0.05131578947368421,0.37456140350877193,1

686,686,Dividi2: Reinforcing divided attention in children with AD/HD through a mobile application," Publication rights licensed to ACM.The Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is a neurological disorder that affects mainly children and teenagers. Some stats indicate that 5.29% of kids under 19 suffer this disorder. The children affected with it usually suffer difficulties to pay attention, to stay focused in a single activity, and might be excessively active. Often, this leads to issues at the school, or following simple commands. Some studies have identified that mobile applications could help in the treatment of children with AD/HD, by contributing to improve different types of attention. We propose Dividi2, a mobile application that aims to improve the split attention in kids with AD/HD. We use some concepts from the recommendations obtained in the EMOINAD guide, related to patterns for the creation of mobile interfaces for children with AD/HD.

We also modify the standard GAN by adding an auxiliary network for text recognition. The system is then trained with a balanced combination of an adversarial loss and a CTC loss. Together, these extensions to GAN enable to control the textual content of the generated word images yielding realistic-looking images on both French and Arabic languages. State-of-the-art offline handwriting text recognition systems tend to use neural networks and therefore require a large amount of annotated data to be trained.

693,693,A novel routing metric for IEEE 802.11s-based swarm-of-drones applications,"With the proliferation of drones in our daily lives, there is an increasing need for handling their numerous challenges. One of such challenge arises when a swarm-of-drones are deployed to accomplish a specific task which requires coordination and communication among the drones. While this swarm-of-drones is essentially a special form of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) which has been studied for many years, there are still some unique requirements of drone applications that necessitates re-visiting MANET approaches. These challenges stem from 3-D environments the drones are deployed in, and their specific way of mobility which adds to the wireless link management challenges among the drones. In this paper, we consider an existing routing standard that is used to enable meshing capability among Wi-Fi enabled nodes, namely IEEE 802.11s and adopt its routing capabilities for swarm-of-drones. Specifically, we propose a link quality metric called SrFTime as an improvement to existing Airtime metric which is the 802.11s default routing metric to enable better network throughput for drone applications. This new metric is designed to fit the link characteristics of drones and enable more efficient routes from drones to their gateway.

694,694,TH-GAN: Generative adversarial network based transfer learning for historical Chinese character recognition,"Historical Chinese character recognition faces problems including low image quality and lack of labeled training samples. We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based transfer learning method to ease these problems. The proposed TH-GAN architecture includes a discriminator and a generator. The network structure of the discriminator is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Inspired by Wasserstein GAN, the loss function of the discriminator aims to measure the probabilistic distribution distance of the generated images and the target images. The network structure of the generator is a CNN based encoder-decoder. The loss function of the generator aims to minimize the distribution distance between the real samples and the generated samples. In order to preserve the complex glyph structure of a historical Chinese character, a weighted mean squared error (MSE) criterion by incorporating both the edge and the skeleton information in the ground truth image is proposed as the weighted pixel loss in the generator. These loss functions are used for joint training of the discriminator and the generator. Experiments are conducted on two tasks to evaluate the performance of the proposed TH-GAN. The first task is carried out on style transfer mapping for multi-font printed traditional Chinese character samples.

In recent times, deep learning based methods have achieved significant performance in handwritten text recognition. However, handwriting recognition using deep learning needs training data, and often, text must be previously segmented into lines (or even words). These limitations constrain the application of HTR techniques in document collections, because training data or segmented words are not always available. Therefore, this paper proposes a training-free and segmentation-free word spotting approach that can be applied in unconstrained scenarios. The proposed word spotting framework is based on document query word expansion and relaxed feature matching algorithm, which can easily be parallelised. Since handwritten words posses distinct shape and characteristics, this work uses a combination of different keypoint detectors and Fourier-based descriptors to obtain a sufficient degree of relaxed matching.

706,706,Improving cognitive abilities through gestural interaction," Publication rights licensed to ACM.The psychology of learning and the neurosciences sustain an ongoing effort in the study of memory in order to facilitate teaching-learning processes. Special attention goes to Working Memory (WM), the conscious, short-term system where learning originates. Persons with cognitive deficiency, for example with Down Syndrome, present limiting conditions in phonological and visuospatial WM, with the latter being less affected. Gamified, digital learning resources, in a gestural interaction environment between human and computer, are proposed for stimulating new learning. We use a quasi-experimental methodology to measure the memory factor in image and text resources, both in a single class lesson and between lessons (∆t=1 wk.), in a population of three students (8 < cognitive age < 12) selected by their regular classroom teachers with the aim of a balanced sample. A lesson plan was personalized for each student, with 3 or 4 work sessions in a row, each lasting 6-12 minutes, and adapted to the computerized gestural interaction platform Tango:H. This lesson plan was repeated for 3 weeks with no changes in the learning resources or strategies. Results show a significant variation in recall between lessons, with a 99.95% confidence level; 100% recall was attained in 33% of the cases. There was no distinction between image- or text-based learning resources in terms of the recall factor; no significant difference in learning outcomes was found between different resource types.",60072064,Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja,Loja,Ecuador,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",25.77777777777778,0.02582371332371333,0.3081825581825582,0

To this end, we propose an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model. It combines a convolutional neural network as a generic feature extractor with a recurrent neural network to encode both the visual information, as well as the temporal context between characters in the input image, and uses a separate recurrent neural network to decode the actual character sequence. We make experimental comparisons between various attention mechanisms and positional encodings, in order to find an appropriate alignment between the input and output sequence. The model can be trained end-to-end and the optional integration of a hybrid loss allows the encoder to retain an interpretable and usable output, if desired. We achieve competitive results on the IAM and ICFHR2016 READ data sets compared to the state-of-the-art without the use of a language model, and we significantly improve over any recent sequence-to-sequence approaches.",60003615,Universität Rostock,Rostock,Germany,['1707'],28.0,0.175,0.38055555555555554,1

In this work, we propose a method to produce realistic synthetic data using an adversarially trained image translation model. We extend the popular CycleGAN model to be conditioned on the ground truth binarization mask as it translates images from the domain of synthetic images to the domain of real images. For evaluation, we train deep networks on synthetic datasets produced in different ways and measure their performance on the DIBCO datasets. Compared to not pretraining, we reduce error by 13% on average, and compared to pretraining on unrealistic data, we reduce error by 6%. Visually, we show that DGT-CycleGAN model produces more realistic synthetic data than other models.",60076047,Adobe Inc.,San Jose,United States,['1707'],22.285714285714285,0.11897759103641459,0.46295518207282915,1
711,711,On optimization of ad-blocking lists for mobile devices,"Online advertisements and third-party web tracking has gained much attention in recent years. Advertisers gather as much data and information about the users to provide targeted advertisement. Though this leads to a better user experience, it comes at the cost of privacy intrusive tracking. To this end, ad-blocking lists (or filter-lists, blacklists) have been introduced which prevent third-party tracking. Ad-blocking lists operate in a crowd-sourced manner, where new tracking domains (or rules) are continuously added by privacy activists and the redundant domains are discarded from the filter-list. Over time, the number of rules added outgrow the number of rules omitted, making it hard to manage the filter-lists. We empirically observe that the filter-lists mostly detect different ad and tracking domains. The filter-lists also use less than 1% of their rules on Alexa top 5,000 websites. This suggests the need to curate optimized filter-lists that provide high coverage and require less time to scan for a given domain on mobile devices. We develop an aggregated and filtered blacklist that is more than 150 times less bulky, and provides the same coverage as the union of the blacklists on Alexa top 5,000 websites. We also develop an update mechanism to incorporate new ad and tracking domains in the aggregated and filtered blacklist in a resource efficient manner.",60019544,Macquarie University,Sydney,Australia,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",19.545454545454547,0.12847687400318977,0.3350398724082934,1

However, SERS is a complex physicochemical phenomenon and tends to suffer from poor levels of reproducibility, which has hindered its translation into practical applications. Here we confirm that the low wavenumber pseudoband arising from the interaction between the edge filter and the elastically scattered light from the laser excitation can be used to perform ""hotspot"" normalisation of SERS spectra. Together with judicious use of resonant Raman scattering and/or careful control of the surface chemistry, this breakthrough in spectral data processing can address many of the challenges encountered when developing a quantitative SERS-based assay.",60030804,Swinburne University of Technology,Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],31.75,-0.009999999999999986,0.52,0
713,713,Adversarial feature enhancing network for end-to-end handwritten paragraph recognition,"To date, offline handwriting paragraph recognition systems either separately crop text line images and recognize them or perform implicit line segmentation by integrating complicated multi-dimensional long short-term memory (MDLSTM) with an attention mechanism. The former abovementioned approachs could lead to sub-optimal performances while the latter is very time-consuming. In this paper, a fast end-to-end system, called adversarial feature enhancing network (AFEN), is proposed for offline handwritten paragraph recognition. The proposed AFEN system comprises five components: a shared feature extractor for robust feature learning, a text detection branch for text box proposal; RoIRotate for oriented feature region extraction, an adversarial feature learning network for joint feature learning of text detection and recognition branch, and a text recognition branch for text transcription. Experiments on two popular handwritten paragraph recognition benchmarks, namely IAM and Rimes are used to verify the efficacy of the proposed AFEN system.

714,714,KuroNet: Pre-modern japanese kuzushiji character recognition with deep learning,"Kuzushiji, a cursive writing style, had been used in Japan for over a thousand years starting from the 8th century. Over 3 millions books on a diverse array of topics, such as literature, science, mathematics and even cooking are preserved. However, following a change to the Japanese writing system in 1900, Kuzushiji has not been included in regular school curricula. Therefore, most Japanese natives nowadays cannot read books written or printed just 150 years ago. Museums and libraries have invested a great deal of effort into creating digital copies of these historical documents as a safeguard against fires, earthquakes and tsunamis. The result has been datasets with hundreds of millions of photographs of historical documents which can only be read by a small number of specially trained experts. Thus there has been a great deal of interest in using Machine Learning to automatically recognize these historical texts and transcribe them into modern Japanese characters. Nevertheless, several challenges in Kuzushiji recognition have made the performance of existing systems extremely poor. To tackle these challenges, we propose KuroNet, a new end-to-end model which jointly recognizes an entire page of text by using a residual U-Net architecture which predicts the location and identity of all characters given a page of text (without any pre-processing). This allows the model to handle long range context, large vocabularies, and non-standardized character layouts. We demonstrate that our system is able to successfully recognize a large fraction of pre-modern Japanese documents, but also explore areas where our system is limited and suggest directions for future work.",60113142,Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms,Montreal,Canada,['1707'],23.454545454545453,0.11937578550481778,0.3170289388031323,1

The learned FL models define the relative positioning of a pair of symbols using both their morphology, their typology and their context. A Random Forest Classifier uses this relative positioning to qualify relationships between symbols. The valued fuzzy visibility graph with the FL membership is produced from this classifier's output. This graph offers an explicit representation of the HME bi-dimensional structure which is then parsed with a set of rules to produce the recognized HME. We evaluate the performance of this system on the task of HME structure recognition using provided segmented symbols with experimental results on both CROHME 2014 and 2016 datasets. We obtain results up to par with the state-of-the-art thus proving that our fuzzy visibility graphs are a strong representation for mathematical expression parsing.",60030553,Universite de Rennes 1,Rennes,France,['1707'],21.428571428571427,0.016666666666666656,0.20416666666666666,1

717,717,Improved security evaluation of SPN block ciphers and its applications in the single-key attack on SKINNY," All rights reserved.In this paper, a new method for evaluating the integral property, truncated and impossible differentials for substitution-permutation network (SPN) block ciphers is proposed. The main assumption is an explicit description/expression of the internal state words in terms of the plaintext (ciphertext) words. By counting the number of times these words occur in the internal state expression, we can evaluate the resistance of a given block cipher to integral and impossible/truncated differential attacks more accurately than previous methods. More precisely, we explore the cryptographic consequences of uneven frequency of occurrences of plaintext (ciphertext) words appearing in the algebraic expression of the internal state words. This approach gives a new family of distinguishers employing different concepts such as the integral property, impossible/truncated differentials and the so-called zero-sum property. We then provide algorithms to determine the maximum number of rounds of such new types of distinguishers for SPN block ciphers. The potential and efficiency of this relatively simple method is confirmed through applications. For instance, in the case of SKINNY block cipher, several 10-round integral distinguishers, all of the 11-round impossible differentials, and a 7-round truncated differential could be determined. For the last case, using a single pair of plaintexts differing in three words so that (a = b = c) ≠ (a′ = b′ = c′), we are able to distinguish 7-round SKINNY from random permutations. More importantly, exploiting our distinguishers, we give the first practical attack on 11-round SKINNY-128-128 in the single-key setting (a theoretical attack reaches 16 rounds). Finally, using the same ideas, we provide a concise explanation on the existing distinguishers for round-reduced AES.",60095095,School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1706']",24.363636363636363,0.06831300013118195,0.47025449298176564,0
718,718,A comprehensive study of imagenet pre-training for historical document image analysis,"Automatic analysis of scanned historical documents comprises a wide range of image analysis tasks, which are often challenging for machine learning due to a lack of human-annotated learning samples. With the advent of deep neural networks, a promising way to cope with the lack of training data is to pre-train models on images from a different domain and then fine-tune them on historical documents. In the current research, a typical example of such cross-domain transfer learning is the use of neural networks that have been pre-trained on the ImageNet database for object recognition. It remains a mostly open question whether or not this pre-training helps to analyse historical documents, which have fundamentally different image properties when compared with ImageNet. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical survey on the effect of ImageNet pre-training for diverse historical document analysis tasks, including character recognition, style classification, manuscript dating, semantic segmentation, and content-based retrieval. While we obtain mixed results for semantic segmentation at pixel-level, we observe a clear trend across different network architectures that ImageNet pre-training has a positive effect on classification as well as content-based retrieval.",60024631,University of Fribourg,Fribourg,Switzerland,['1707'],30.833333333333332,0.03502886002886003,0.3644660894660894,1
719,719,An overview of assistive devices for blind and visually impaired people," All rights reserved.Across the world, there are approximately 253 million people with vision impairments, and assistive devices have constantly been in demand. Advanced research has led to the development of numerous assistive devices for blind people and visually impaired people (VIP) to improve their quality of life. An overview of these different types of assistive devices such as canes, glasses, hats and gloves is presented in this survey. A FCBPSS (F: function, C: context, B: behaviour, P: principle, S: state, S: structure) architecture of visual impairment assistance system is preliminarily proposed to allow other researchers to design the assistive devices with the good experience and the high performance for blind people and VIPs in the future. As VIPs and blind people may have different behaviour patterns, a criterion for classifying different types of vision impairments is presented. Subsequently, we classify the substitutive senses for visual perception into five categories: vision enhancement, audition, somatosense, visual prosthesis, and olfactory and gustation. Two commonly used feedback forms, namely audition and vibration, are elaborated.

720,720,Bayesian optimized 1-bit CNNs,"Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have dominated the recent developments in computer vision through making various record-breaking models. However, it is still a great challenge to achieve powerful DCNNs in resource-limited environments, such as on embedded devices and smart phones. Researchers have realized that 1-bit CNNs can be one feasible solution to resolve the issue; however, they are baffled by the inferior performance compared to the full-precision DCNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Bayesian optimized 1-bit CNNs (denoted as BONNs), taking the advantage of Bayesian learning, a well-established strategy for hard problems, to significantly improve the performance of extreme 1-bit CNNs. We incorporate the prior distributions of full-precision kernels and features into the Bayesian framework to construct 1-bit CNNs in an end-to-end manner, which have not been considered in any previous related methods. The Bayesian losses are achieved with a theoretical support to optimize the network simultaneously in both continuous and discrete spaces, aggregating different losses jointly to improve the model capacity. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR datasets show that BONNs achieve the best classification performance compared to state-of-the-art 1-bit CNNs.",60119391,Huawei Noah's Ark Lab,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707']",26.714285714285715,0.1238795518207283,0.49173669467787123,1

Legibility is relatively little investigated in multi-robot systems, but, in the literature, studies exist where the trajectory of manipulators is analyzed as a factor to improve the collaboration between robots and users. In this paper, we focus on the legibility of a group of mobile robots. To this end, we consider a set of motion-variables: trajectory, dispersion and stiffness. They are typical parameters that determine the motion of a group of robots. To analyze the effect of the motion-variables over legibility, Fisher's exact test and ANOVA (analysis of variance) were carried out. The data for the statistical analysis cover a full factorial plan and they were collected in a virtual reality set-up, where the users shared the environment with a group of robots. We investigate two aspects of legibility: the correctness and the rapidity of communication, namely if the communication happens correctly and how fast it happens. Trajectory was found to be relevant to correctly communicate the intention of the robots, while stiffness and dispersion were relevant for the rapidity of legibility.",60004591,Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia,Modena,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.0,0.1779761904761905,0.6,1
722,722,Confidence-based early classification of multivariate time series with multiple interpretable rules,", part of Springer Nature.In the process of early classification, earliness and accuracy are two key indicators to evaluate the performance of classification, and early classification usually weaken its accuracy to some degree. Therefore, how to find a tradeoff between two conflict objectives is a challenging work. So far, there are just a few work touched the quality of early classification on univariate time series, and the confidence estimation for early classification on multivariate time series (MTS) is still an open issue. In this paper, we focus on interpretably classifying MTS examples as early as possible while guaranteeing the quality of the classification results. First, a fast method is proposed to mine interpretable and local rules from the MTS training data. Second, a valid measure is advanced to estimate the confidence of early classification on MTS examples.

For achieving this goal, several deep learning-based facial image analysis and synthesis techniques recently have been proposed. However, there are difficulties in the construction of facial image dataset having accurate emotion tags (annotations, metadata), because such emotion tags significantly depend on human perception and cognition. In this study, we constructed facial image dataset having accurate emotion tags through subjective experiments. First, based on image retrieval using the emotion terms, we collected more than 1,600,000 facial images from SNS. Next, based on a face detection image processing, we obtained approximately 380,000 facial region images as “big data.” Then, through subjective experiments, we manually checked the facial expression and the corresponding emotion tags of the facial regions. Finally, we achieved approximately 5,500 facial images having accurate emotion tags as “good data.” For validating our facial image dataset in deep learning-based facial image analysis and synthesis, we applied our dataset to CNN-based facial emotion recognition and GAN-based facial emotion reconstruction.

The spore resistance of two thermophilic marine strains, Geobacillus vulcani DSM 13174 and Bacillus licheniformis T14, isolated from two SHV (Eolian Islands, Italy), to wet- and dry- heat was compared to their close phylogenetic relatives (G. stearothermophilus DSM 22T and B. licheniformis DSM 13T), and to the biodosimetry and space microbiology model strain B. subtilis 168. To determine the heat resistance, spore suspensions (107/ml) of each strain were exposed at wet-heat (95◦C for 60 min) and dry-heat (130◦C for 90 min) conditions. The spores viability was determined plating aliquots of each treated sample onto Tryptone Soy Agar plates, and finally the resistance of spores to both wet- and dry-heat treatments was expressed as LD90. The highest degree of spore resistance was observed for G. stearothermophilus, with similar level of resistance for G. vulcani. Spores from B. licheniformis T14 were more resistant than those of the closely related B. licheniformis DSM 13T, and also than those of B. subtilis 168. Spores of the two thermophilic marine strains were more resistant to heat stresses than B. subtilis 168, which may reflect their own adaptation to the severe environmental vents conditions.

While micro-expression recognition methods have obtained the promising results by applying deep learning techniques, the performance of the ME spotting task still needs to be largely improved. Most of the approaches still rely upon traditional techniques such as distance measurement between handcrafted features of frames which are not robust enough in detecting ME locations correctly. In this paper, we propose a novel method for ME spotting based on a deep sequence model.

730,730,A sensitivity analysis about reactive power supply of wave-offshore hybrid generation system,"Background/Objectives Recently designed hybrid power generation system (HGS) not only takes into account voltage conditions of grid connection points, but also supports reactive power according to the instructions of transmission system operators. Methods/Statistical analysis: The operation plan for conversion device of HGS should be supported by accurate effect estimation regarding reactive power. The system has a large physical area and is interconnected with the grid through a long power transmission system. Therefore, it is necessary to consider an additional compensation plan in the realistic measurement process of the transmission reactive energy using HGS.

731,731,Real time enhancement of low light images for low cost embedded platforms," These poor-quality images act as hindrance for computer vision algorithms as well as human vision. While this problem can be solved by increasing the exposure time, it also introduces new problems. In applications like ADAS, where there are fast moving objects in the scene, increasing the exposure time will cause motion blur. In applications, that demand higher frame rate, increasing the exposure time is not an option. Increasing the gain will result in noise as well as saturation of pixels at higher end. So, a real time scene adaptive algorithm is required for the enhancement of low light images. We propose a real time low light enhancement algorithm with more detail preservation compared to existing global based enhancement algorithms for low cost embedded platforms. The algorithm is integrated to image signal processing pipeline of TI's TDA3x and achieved ~50fps on c66x DSP for HD resolution video captured from Omnivision's OV10640 Bayer image sensor.",123953211,PathPartner Technology Pvt.

Commonly used quality metrics cannot reliably measure the visibility of such artifacts. In this paper we introduce a visual model for predicting the visibility of both luminance and chrominance banding artifacts in image gradients spanning between two arbitrary points in a color space. The model analyzes the error introduced by quantization in the Fourier space, and employs a purpose-built spatio-chromatic contrast sensitivity function to predict its visibility. The output of the model is a detection probability, which can be then used to compute the minimum bit-depth for which banding artifacts are just-noticeable.

736,736,"Meteotsunami of 29 August 1916 at Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic - Analysis of the destruction of the USS Memphis","Official revised records of a U.S. Navy Court of Inquiry concluded that the 29 August 1916 destruction of the armored cruiser USS Memphis anchored off Santo Domingo (Ciudad Trujillo) harbor of the Dominican Republic, Island of Hispaniola, was probably caused by a ""tropical disturbance"", a ""seismic storm"", or a ""tsunami"". However, the present analysis of this naval disaster documents that the loss of the ship was not due to any of these causes, but to rogue waves of a meteotsunami generated from a rapid, significant and progressive drop in atmospheric pressure which begun in the area around August 22 and was associated with a passing hurricane which at its closest point was about 250 nautical miles to the south. Also, storm waves from this hurricane moved towards Santo Domingo refracting in resonance near shore and were further amplified and transformed by the low barometric pressure, the shallow continental shelf and the local coastal features and bathymetry of the bay. The present analysis is based on careful examination of the ship's log, and on observations of events by the crew and people on the shore. Given the limited meteorological data of that time period, the present analysis used an empirical approach to roughly evaluate the Rayleigh distribution function, the upper limit of storm wave height variability away from the most intense wind fetches, as well as the maximum period, wavelength and deep-water heights of generated storm waves. Based on Airy and cnoidal wave theories, the deep water period and celerity of the most significant extreme wave was of meteorological origin which was transformed in shallower water by the resonant and superimposed arrival of two other waves which created a three step plateau on the face of a huge single rogue wave of the meteotsunami, estimated to be about 70 feet in height, with three distinct steps, two plateaus on its forward face, and a preceding trough estimated to be 300 ft. long. Based on this analysis, the present study concluded that it was this significant meteotsunami/rogue wave, in combination with concurrently arriving storm swells, that engulfed the USS Memphis at 1640 hour in the afternoon of 29 August 1916 - breaking the chains of its anchors and wrecking it on the rocks of Santo Domingo.",107907113,Tsunami Society International,Honolulu,United States,"['1703', '1712', '1705']",41.55555555555556,0.07970032840722498,0.4114532019704434,1

Unfortunately, most classifiers suffer from the Hughes effect when dealing with high-dimensional hyperspectral data. Therefore we propose a new framework of hyperspectral-based feature extraction and classification.

740,740,Study of the influence of the main parameters of “rolling-ecap” process on the stress-strain state and the microstructure evolution using computer simulation," Published by Elsevier B.V.The paper presents the results of computer simulation of the combined process, which combines longitudinal rolling and equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP). The simulation was carried out in the program Deform-3Dto assess the impact of the main parameters of the process on the stress-strain state. Analysis of the influence of various factors on the stress and strain state of the process showed that such factors as the junction angle of the matrix channels and the workpiece heating temperature have a significant impact on the distribution of stresses and accumulated deformation throughout the volume of the workpiece in the implementation of the combined process ""rolling-ECAP"". At the same time, the variation of the values of the friction coefficients and the lengths of the matrix channels within the permissible values does not play a significant role in changing the SSS parameters in this combined process. As a result of studying the microstructure evolution after modeling in the Simufact Forming program, it was found that the combined method ""rolling-ECAP"" allows to significantly grind the initial grain size. It is established that the influence of the workpiece heating temperature plays a significant role in the degree of grain grinding. In order to reduce the spread of values and alignment of grain size across the section, it is necessary to subject the workpiece to several deformation cycles. After the third pass, the average grain size difference between the central and surface zones is only 3 µm, which is much smaller than that after the first pass (7 µm).

However, a disadvantage of two-phase simulation is the high demand for computation resource, which makes the calculation time-consuming for practical application. In the study, based on the SOLA Level-Set method for gas-liquid two-phase flow during the mold filling process, a new parallel partitioning algorithm standard is proposed by using MPI (Message Passing Interface) parallel programming technique. A region-based algorithm based on dynamic programming is designed and a parallel partition model is established. A parallel program for gas-liquid two-phase flow numerical simulation is developed. A mapping array method is proposed to reduce the communication overhead between sub-domains. The communication steps between sub-domains in the process of solving the complex flow field are designed.

743,743,Development of the new fast approach for calculation of texture evolution during hot deformation of aluminum alloys," Published by Elsevier B.V.In recent years a lot of models for calculation of texture evolution during hot deformation have been proposed. The main deficit of these models its speed which is not enough for using them directly in hot rolling mills control systems. That is why new more simple and faster algorithms of texture calculation are crucial. In this work a new method for predicting changes in orientation of FCC crystals during deformation was proposed, based on representing deformation as slide along slip systems of certain crystal selected by minimization of plastic power. The method was developed for flat (plane strain) deformation, i.e. for sheet rolling. Any deformation work with conservation of volume may be represented as five vector components which can be derived from any of the 12 slip systems of FCC crystal. This means that any arbitrary deformation of crystals can be presented as linear combination of five linearly independent vectors corresponding to the slip systems of a crystal. Here are altogether 384 linear independent combinations of vectors corresponding to 12 slip systems are possible and, straight forward calculation of plastic deformation power can be done fast enough by using modern computers. Therefore, in the proposed new method all possible combination of slip systems are realized and selected to find the optimum. The advantage of this approach as compared to linear programming method consist in that even complicated laws of deformation hardening can be included. Any non-linear dependence of the slip systems critical stress on deformation and deformation rate may be introduced as well as the influence of interacting slip systems. The Full constraint method was used here, but with minor modification any relaxed constraint model is also applicable.",60011415,Samara National Research University,Samara,Russian Federation,['1702'],21.692307692307693,0.10232297464440322,0.5393050401978974,0

The local cultural and artistic performing industry is one of the key industries. Methods/Statistical analysis: This study used the Convenience Sampling Method to survey the main cultural and artistic center of Jeonju, the Gumi Cultural Art Center, and the Busan Civic Center. 360 copies of the total 420 questionnaires were collected for the artists and the general public in the above regions. 350 units of the survey were used for the actual analysis except for 10 people whose survey contents were missing. Findings: In local cultural and arts performances, products represent works, which are influenced by aspects of artistry, creativity, diversity of characters, and understanding of content. When it comes to product development, the biggest concern in planning the performance will be how to harmonize and develop entertainment works that can create the artistic value for completion of the work and the audience's interest, and also contribute to the diverse cultural activities of local residents. In Korea, for example, professional sports products are heavily activated locally and are easily accessible to the public. The development of novel genres and stories that can shock audiences can also be a strategy considering creativity. As such, local cultural and artistic performances need to be contributed to meet the needs of audiences through diverse genres and materials and to improve the cultural standards of the region. A constant effort to attract audience attention would be the best strategy to bring attention to cultural and artistic performances.

The intriguing aspects of knowledge transfer have enabled it to be studied and examined from diverse angles and multi perspectives. Many however, tend to overlook the essence of effective knowledge transfer that is, the utilization of knowledge being transferred. For knowledge-intensive environment such as software development project, knowledge integration which encompasses activities of transferring various knowledge across different software processes often takes place. Best case scenario would be a generous opportunity to learn from each other, creating new knowledge and ultimately delivering quality software. But many failed to reap its advantage resultant from its impulsive nature and lack of methods to verify use of knowledge when the transfer happens. Alarmed by this situation, we proposed PKAMI, a model for characterizing knowledge utilization thus enables the verification of effective knowledge transfer. In our previous study we focused into software architecture development. In this paper, we attempt to investigate knowledge transfer a step further, which is in the process of designing the software to be developed for a project, carried out by our students and supervised by our industrial partners.

We describe scenarios where people without any machine learning background could find it useful to define their own solution which uses machine learning. Although machine learning is becoming ubiquitous, the average person is unaware of the steps involved. This abstraction makes sense, in many situations, such as traffic predictions, it is not necessary for the driver to know what machine learning algorithm is running. However, we consider examples where knowing how to incorporate machine learning into a problem would assist in decision making. We propose a workflow with operations leading to a final application. There are several challenges here, namely, the average consumer is not expected to have a mathematical background, nor is expected to acquire any additional background. To achieve this new utility, we use a visual analytic pipeline which integrates machine learning and the person.

Combined with Fluent fluid simulation module, a two-dimensional steady-state laminar flow coupled model of copper-aluminium clad plate cast-rolling process was established. Through the analysis of range data obtained by orthogonal simulation design method, the order of importance of each factor is as follows: billet speed, cast-rolling zone length, preheating temperature of copper strip, pouring temperature. Through the analysis of factors and indicators (liquid hole depth ratio), the suitable technological parameters range are 0.3~0.6 m.min-1 for billet speed, 933~993 K for pouring temperature, 300~431 K for preheating temperature of copper strip, 57~80 mm for cast-rolling zone length. In order to verify the reliability of numerical simulation method and result analysis, the casting-rolling test was carried out with simulated process parameters. The exit temperature was measured by thermocouple. The results show that the error between simulation results and measured results is small, which verifies the accuracy of simulation and the feasibility of guiding production. When the billet speed is 0.5 m/min, the pouring temperature is 963 K, the length of casting-rolling zone is 70 mm and the copper strip is not preheated, the 10 mm thick copper-aluminium composite plate has better shape.

752,752,DriveSpace: Towards context-aware drivable area detection," It describes the region, which is typically the road surface, around the vehicle which is free from obstacles.

We formulate it based on combination of dense 3d reconstruction and semantic segmentation. We use a graphical model approach to fuse and learn the drivable area. As the drivable region is highly dependent on the situation and dynamics of other objects, it remains a bit subjective. We analyze various scenarios of DriveSpace and propose a general method to detect all scenarios. As it is a new concept, there are no datasets available for development and test, however, we are working on creating the same to show quantitative results of the proposed method.",112956735,Valeo North America Inc,Troy,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",20.77777777777778,0.1113088023088023,0.4308917748917749,0

The Thyristor Mid-pointed Diode bridge type fault current limiter (TM-DBFCL) and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) are the major components to improve these capabilities and reduce the power and voltage fluctuations. In this paper FRT capability enhancement and smoothing the output power are designed as a multi objective function in a fuzzy framework by optimizing the proportional integral (PI) gains of PV, Wind and SMES controllers in the network. For obtaining the optimized parameters of gains the Hybrid Big Bang and Big Crunch (HBB-BC) optimization algorithm is proposed.

755,755,New results for natural language processing applied to an on-line fashion marketplace," In clothing fashion there are different seasons of clothing, which account for some of the changing patterns. There are also trends on the scale of the general public, on both shorter time scales and longer time scales. The volatility of these trends poses an issue to conventional natural language processing techniques as well as machine learning approaches. Due to the frequent and unpredictable changes that can occur in a fashion context, models that cannot adapt eventually fail. Like our prior work [1], the model developed here predicts the category and subcategory of fashion items based on the textual contents of the title. The model developed is also capable of adapting to future changes in fashion including the addition of new terminology and changing popularity and classification for existing items. This paper covers some of the problems conventional natural language processing approaches face when tasked with classifying titles in a fashion context. It then covers a few potential approaches to dealing with the implementation of machine learning approaches for classification purposes, and why they fail in the given situation. Finally, this paper presents a solution in the form of a model utilizing feature hashing and the Passive-Aggressive classifier. The results show this model performs as well as the prior model, with a much better training time.

Among the different method proposed, wavelet decomposition are used as inputs to super resolution networks to provide structural information about the image. Residual connections may also link different network layers to help propagate high frequencies. We review and compare the usage of wavelets and residuals in training super resolution neural networks. We show that residual connections are key in improving the performance of deep super resolution networks.

Methods/Statistical analysis:This study carried out survey for data collection. Research subjects were asked to watch experimental stimulus (one Brand Webtoon) freely for 10 minutes, and the stimulus was exposed to everyone in the two experiment groups. Lastly, survey questionnaire was completed by survey participants. Survey questionnaire was comprised with questions regarding Brand Webtoon characteristics, attitude towards product, purchase intention, and demographic questions. Findings: First, entertainment factor and immersion exerted high positive effect on the advertising attitude in the highly fictional character group in the order mentioned. In case of the lowly fictional character group, usefulness, entertainment factor, immersion exerted high positive effect in the order mentioned. In other words, it is judged that there is a difference in the effect on the advertising attitude when it comes to the Brand Webtoon characteristics among the groups following character fictionality. Third, positive effect on the relationship between two groups’ advertising attitude and purchase Intention was exerted. Moreover, in case of highly fictional character group, it was shown that the effect was relatively high when it comes to the correlation of advertising attitude and purchase Intention compared to the lowly fictional character group.

759,759,Discovery of activities via statistical clustering of fixation patterns," All rights reserved.Human behavior often consists of a series of distinct activities, each characterized by a unique pattern of interaction with the visual environment. This is true even in a restricted domain, such as a pilot flying an airplane; in this case, activities with distinct visual signatures might be things like communicating, navigating, monitoring, etc. We propose a novel analysis method for gaze-tracking data, to perform blind discovery of these hypothetical activities. The method is in some respects analogous to recurrence analysis, which has previously been applied to eye movement data. In the present case, however, we compare not individual fixations, but groups of fixations aggregated over a fixed time interval (τ). We assume that the environment has been divided into a finite set of discrete areas-of-interest (AOIs). For a given time interval, we compute the proportion of time spent fixating each AOI, resulting in an N-dimensional vector, where N is the number of AOIs. These proportions can be converted to integer counts by multiplying by τ divided by the average fixation duration, a parameter that we fix at 283 milliseconds. We compare different intervals by computing the chi-squared statistic. The p-value associated with the statistic is the likelihood of observing the data under the hypothesis that the data in the two intervals were generated by a single process with a single set of probabilities governing the fixation of each AOI. We cluster the intervals, first by merging adjacent intervals that are sufficiently similar, optionally shifting the boundary between non-merged intervals to maximize the difference. Then we compare and cluster non-adjacent intervals. The method is evaluated using synthetic data generated by a hand-crafted set of activities. While the method generally finds more activities than put into the simulation, we have obtained agreement as high as 80% between the inferred activity labels and ground truth.",60004179,NASA Ames Research Center,Moffett Field,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",21.785714285714285,0.060248917748917746,0.36296536796536794,0

Our methods efficiently and accurately localize the agent across a stack of maps generated from different sensors across different periods of time. To incorporate a priori localization data, we account for the discrepancies between LiDAR observations and publicly available building geometry. We fuse data derived from heterogeneous sensor modalities to increase invariance to dynamic environmental factors, such as weather, luminance, and occlusions. To discriminate traversable terrain, we employ a deep segmentation network whose predictions increase the confidence of a LiDAR-generated cost map.

762,762,Multi-frame super-resolution utilizing spatially adaptive regularization for ToF camera,"Recently, 3D time-of-flight cameras have been developed. The development enables utilization of depth images in various fields. However, acquired depth images are corrupted by noise during the image acquisition process and have relatively lower resolution than RGB images due to the limitation of ToF cameras. In this paper, a multi-frame super-resolution reconstruction algorithm is proposed for ToF depth images to overcome such limits. The purpose of the multi-frame super-resolution reconstruction is to reconstruct a high-resolution image from observed multiple low-resolution images through the sequential process of subpixel estimation and restoration. A conventional regularized super-resolution reconstruction algorithm which takes Tikhonov regularization has a major drawback of over-smoothing around edges. To overcome the disadvantage, the spatially adaptive regularization is suggested for preservation of edges. Experimental results show that the image reconstructed by the proposed super-resolution reconstruction algorithm contains significantly higher resolution with less amount of noise and sharper edges than the observed data.",60016912,Yonsei University,Seoul,South Korea,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",18.875,0.006498015873015875,0.31240079365079365,1

However, as an important attribute of fashion garments, color in fashion is rarely studied subject, and a color name matching algorithm is highly desired by the online fashion community that maps a garment color from an image to a verbal description . As a continuation of our previous nearest-neighbor-based fashion color matching method, in this paper, we propose a psychophysical experiment to collect fashion color naming data and a new data-driven classification model using random forest for color name classification. Our reversed color naming experiment uses a simple and straightforward procedure to extract users' color naming schema. The random-forest classifier utilizes a set of linear and non-linear features in CIELab color space. It achieves more than 80% accuracy, and shows great improvement over our nearest-neighbor-based model. Furthermore, this data-driven approach also has the ability of actively and dynamically learn and improve the algorithm; and it is also able to learn new users' color vocabularies.",60009254,Purdue University,West Lafayette,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",24.142857142857142,0.1245530303030303,0.48531168831168825,1

Keeping a group of standard, instead of only one, is one of the best methods to maintain the national standards and ensuring the establishment of the standard's nominal value with the desired uncertainty. A group of five standard resistor including one externally calibrated standard resistor R1, were arranged to form a network of relationship between the resistors R2, R3, R4 and R5 using the Direct Current Comparator Bridge (DCC Bridge). It has been proven that the mathematical analysis with the measurement method B to preserve a group of 1 Ω standard resistors is much more reliable and stable than the previous method that use only R1 as a reference resistor. The average value of five standards is assumed to remains constant with time. By using this evaluation, if there is a relatively large change in resistance of the standard, by reference to the average, we will be able to identify which resistor that deviate easily.",60001821,Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,Bangi,Malaysia,['1700'],29.0,0.10367965367965368,0.31304112554112556,1
765,765,A snowfall noise elimination using moving object compositing method adaptable to natural boundary,"In recent years, the use of surveillance cameras is increasingly recommended and they have been installed in many places. Snowy conditions at the time of an accident were associated with the problem that cars and accident circumstances become difficult to discern in images shot during snowfall. Previous techniques proposed methods for elimination of noise caused by snow using image shift or dedicated filters for the elimination of snowfall in video. However, these are associated with issues such as inability to cope with heavy snowfall or moving objects fading from view or being hard to discern. The present study proposes a method for snowfall noise elimination by extracting moving objects using the travel and the size of the moving object region between continuous frames, and compositing images while correcting for brightness in the background images. By distinguishing between falling snow and other moving objects, we can prevent objects other than snowfall becoming invisible. Using video of actual vehicles driving in snowy conditions for our experiments, we confirmed that snowfall noise can be eliminated without moving objects in the video becoming invisible. Furthermore, we confirmed that moving objects can be incorporated into the composited background images without any sense that they are out of place.",60009824,Tokyo City University,Tokyo,Japan,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",25.375,0.05277777777777778,0.5338888888888889,1

767,767,An efficient information retrieval and routing using AODV on TDMA in WSNs,"In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based slot scheduling is one of the essential research problems during the fast data collection process. In order to enhance the lifetime of the network, TDMA slot allocation is considered as significant methodology. In this research, for minimizing the consumption of energy during the process of information retrieval, effectively discovering the appropriate routes and maintenance of routing process, we introduced K-Means-TDMA-AODV methodology where the formation of clusters and selection of cluster head is managed by the K-Means clustering algorithm. The Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) is simplified by utilizing the neighbour information strategy in a TDMA protocol.For the time critical data, the TDMA methodology failed to minimize the time delay, however, the TDMA helps to maximize the network lifetime through adjusting the schedule of the TDMA slot. Thus, the proposed K-Means-TDMA-AODV provides the better performance in terms of number of data packets received by the base station, lifetime of the network, maintain the number of alive nodes and consumption of energy. The performance of the proposed K-Means-TDMA-AODV methodology is compared with the standard existing information retrieval routing protocol Ex-APTEEN.

Unfortunately, these image crops are not optimal for video analysis, so that the person detection becomes suboptimal and person re-ID obtains a lower performance score. In this work, several techniques are presented that customize the person images of a popular public person re-ID dataset. These techniques consist of customization algorithms based on postprocessing the person-detection bounding boxes using the original frames, resulting in several customized datasets to better facilitate person re-identification. We have evaluated five different ways for customization, based on widening the image crops, various aspect ratios and resolutions, and person instance segmentation. We have obtained a significant increase in performance with widened image crops, yielding a convincing performance increase of nearly 3% in the resulting Rank-1 score. Furthermore, when the applied random-cropping process is further optimized to this customization technique, an increase of even more than 4% is obtained. Both performance gains are a strong indication that any future person re-ID system may benefit from customizations based on the original video frames or from specializing the person detector.",60032882,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Eindhoven,Netherlands,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",24.625,0.1643452380952381,0.49404761904761907,1

Structural and morphological characterization of these GQDs was carried out using XRD, Raman, and FTIR. As synthesized at the same time XRD results established their crystalline nature. Raman spectroscopic measurements exhibited the characteristic ""D"" (a thousand cm−1) and ""G"" (3500 cm−1) bands confirming the formation of low dimensional graphene nanostructures. Optical properties of these GQDs had been probed making use of UV-seen spectrometry and room temperature Photoluminescence measurements. The UV-vis spectrum confirmed a powerful absorption at 320 nm. These GQDs exhibited fluorescence regularly at 440 nm when excited at one of kind wavelengths. The fluorescence of GQDs was observed to be sensitive to pH linearly over the pH range of four–12 which may also be exploited for pH sensor purposes. FTIR spectroscopy has proven the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl practical moieties on the surface of the GQDs, which play a significant position in surface passivation leading to extra steady nanoparticle dispersions.

779,779,Atomic layer deposited Al2O3 films on NiTi shape memory alloys for biomedical applications," Published by Elsevier B.V.NiTi shape memory alloys (SMAs) have been widely applied in biomedical fields owing to their excellent shape memory effect, super-elasticity, biomedical properties and fatigue performance. These applications include the cardiovascular stent, guidewire, stone extractors used in the cystic duct, artificial heart valve and orthodontic wire, etc. However, NiTi alloys might release out the Ni atoms in the physiological environment, which will induce the serious problems of allergic reaction, poisoning and causing cancer. This study employs the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to deposit Al2O3 films on the surfaces of NiTi SMAs. Experimental results show that the chemical compositions of ALD-Al2O3 films are well homogeneous. The ALD-Al2O3 films exhibit a fair adhesion with the NiTi substrates and sustain a suitable deformation strain. The ALD-Al2O3 films can also effectively inhibit the release out of Ni atoms from the NiTi SMAs. Meanwhile, the corrosion resistance of NiTi SMAs can be improved by the ALD-Al2O3 films.",60073385,National Taiwan University Hospital,Taipei,Taiwan,['1702'],19.5,0.23958333333333337,0.7395833333333333,0

782,782,A vehicle device tailored for hybrid trolleybuses and overhead wires implementation in sumo," All rights reserved.The electrification of transport is one of the key parts of the present aim to reduce undesirable vehicular emissions in the atmosphere. While the full electrification of personal vehicles is mostly associated with employing a big battery pack on the board and charging on (static) charging stations, another interesting possibility appears in the case of public transport – dynamic drawing of the power from overhead wires. Regarding vehicles moving on the road, this concept is used by trolleybuses or hybrid trolleybuses, i.e. vehicles combining power from the overhead wires and batteries. A replacement of classic buses (with a combustion engine) with (hybrid) trolleybuses is hardly possible without an appropriate adjustment of public transport lines and the necessary infrastructure. For this purpose, a simulation of the adjusted public transport service may be used to identify weaknesses of the proposed solution. This paper presents a new vehicle device and a new additional part of road infrastructure in SUMO. It introduces device.elecHybrid based on existing device.battery, extending its functionality and tailoring it for the needs of hybrid trolleybuses. In addition, overhead wires and traction substations are implemented. As the voltage and electric currents in the overhead wires depend on traffic, the overhead wire parameters are optionally evaluated by a built-in electric circuit solver using Kirchhoff’s laws. The proposed changes allow us to simulate hybrid trolleybus in-motion charging under the overhead wire. The extensions can be immediately used in micro-simulations or even (in a simplified version) in the meso-simulation mode.",60003263,University of West Bohemia,Plzen,Czech Republic,['1700'],20.75,0.15496632996632995,0.4329124579124579,0
783,783,Charge effects in water solution of a low generation sodium carboxylate terminated dendrimers," This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Dendrimers, a class of novel nano-sized materials characterized by a highly ramified structure and a relevant number of functional surface groups, represent a versatile platform for a wide range of nanotechnology applications. The number and characteristic of their modifiable surface groups strongly influence the solution properties as well as some relevant processes involved in molecular recognition, signal processing as well as for binding various targeting or guest molecules. Owing to these properties dendrimers have attracted the interest of the researchers in the development of new prototypes implicated in many technological applications. However, despite of their recent extensive studies, their colloidal stability in solution environment have been relatively less investigated. With the aim to furnish useful insight about the inter-dendrimer interaction in solution, a Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) structural investigation on the sodium carboxylate terminated (-COO-Na) generations G1.5 of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers in water solution has been performed. The presence of a pronounced interference peak in the SAXS spectra in a wide range of concentrations gives evidence of a long range electrostatic interaction which has been ascribed to the ionisation of the surface carboxylate terminal end-groups. The experimental inter-dendrimer structure factor S(q) has been analysed in the framework of liquid integral equation theory. From that, we derived an effective inter-particle interaction composed of a screened Coulombic plus hard-sphere repulsion potential, which allows the estimation of the dendrimer effective surface charge Zef f. The present analysis strongly supports the finding that colloidal stability and interaction of dendrimers in solution environment is strongly influenced by charge effects.",60021199,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,Rome,Italy,['1700'],30.666666666666668,0.14307519640852973,0.5078226711560045,0

The detection, classification, and assessment of printing defects can reflect the printer's working status and help to locate mechanical problems inside. To handle all these questions, an efficient algorithm is needed to replace the traditionally visual checking method. In this paper, we focus on pages with local defects including gray spots and solid spots. We propose a coarse-to-fine method to detect local defects in a block-wise manner, and aggregate the blockwise attributes to generate the feature vector of the whole test page for a further ranking task. In the detection part, we first select candidate regions by thresholding a single feature. Then more detailed features of candidate blocks are calculated and sent to a decision tree that is previously trained on our training dataset. The final result is given by the decision tree model to control the false alarm rate while maintaining the required miss rate.

Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) is a model that enables developers to classify defects and track the process of inspection and testing. However, ODC was introduced to classify defects of traditional software. Mobile applications differ from traditional applications in many ways; they are susceptible to external factors, such as screen and network changes, notifications, and phone interruptions, which affect the applications’ functioning. Therefore, in this paper, the ODC model will be adapted to accommodate defects of mobile applications. This allows us to address newly introduced application defects found in the mobile domain, such as energy, notification, and Graphical User Interface (GUI). In addition, based on the new model, we classify found defects of two well-known mobile applications. Moreover, we discuss one-way and two-way analyses.

789,789,NPAC FM color halftoning for the Indigo press: Challenges and solutions,"FM halftoning is increasingly popular with traditional analog offset lithographic printing processes. There is a desire to offer this capability with digital presses based on electrophotographic printing (EP) technologies. However, the inherent instability of the EP process challenges the achievement of satisfactory print quality with dispersed-dot, aperiodic halftoning. The direct binary search (DBS) algorithm is widely considered to represent the gold standard of dispersed-dot, aperiodic halftone image quality. In this paper, we continue our previous efforts to adapt DBS to use with the Indigo liquid EP printing technology. We describe a complete color management pipeline for halftoning with a PARAWACS matrix designed using DBS. For the first time, we show actual printed patches obtained using our process. Our gamut mapping is performed in the YyCxCz color space, and is image-dependent. It incorporates several stages of alignment between the input and output spaces, as well as several stages of compression. After the gamut mapping, we tessellate the output color space into six global tetrahedra that each share the neutral axis, as an edge.

790,790,Efficient n-to-n collision detection for space debris using 4d aabb trees," All rights reserved.Collision detection algorithms are used in aerospace, swarm robotics, automotive, video gaming, dynamics simulation and other domains. As many applications of collision detection run online, timing requirements are imposed on the algorithm runtime: algorithms must, at a minimum, keep up with the passage of time. Even offline reachability computation can be slowed down by the process of safety checking when n is large and the specification is n-to-n collision avoidance. In practice, this places a limit on the number of objects, n, that can be concurrently tracked or verified. In this paper, we present an improved method for efficient object tracking and collision detection, based on a modified version of the axis-aligned bounding-box (AABB) tree data structure. We consider 4D AABB Trees, where a time dimension is added to the usual three space dimensions, in order to enable per-object time steps when checking for collisions in space-time. We evaluate the approach on a space debris collision benchmark, demonstrating efficient checking beyond the full catalog of n = 16848 space objects made public by the U.S. Strategic Command on www.space-track.org.",60025576,Wright-Patterson AFB,Dayton,United States,['1700'],22.75,0.06671626984126983,0.30739087301587303,0

However, due to the unusual structure of the permanent magnet embedded in the rotor, high cogging torque occurs. Methods/Statistical analysis: This paper obtains data using finite element method. We propose a suitable magnetic circuit for this model and derive precise mathematical data through MATLAB. By simplifying the structure of the model, it is convenient to compare the simulation results with the equations derived from the magnetic circuit. Experimental design was used to optimize the shape of the notch. Findings: The motor adopted as the basic model in this paper is the motor in mass production. Simplify the effects of the notch by simplifying this motor rather than directly interpreting it. We make mathematical calculation method through magnetic circuit and compare the formula with the result of derivation and finite element method using MATLAB. The experimental design method is then used to derive the optimal shape of the notch and compare it with the proposed mathematical model. The error rate is set at about 1 percent and the study is conducted. The experimental design method uses the Taguchi technique and mentions how to minimize cogging torque by applying two notches (in the rotor) just above the magnet concentrator. Cogging torque by shape (parameters) is examined and the notch effect is considered by finding the optimal point and reflecting it in notch shape. The expected effect of the future can be easily predicted the cogging torque of this model through mathematical formulas and experimental design. Improvements/Applications: The proposed theory is that the cogging torque can be easily confirmed by using the experimental design through the equation.

However, the image quality attributes of the streaming whiteboard contents as well as users' expectations from such whiteboard scenes are not well investigated. Therefore, the primary goal of this work is to examine the effects of the different whiteboard image features on the overall quality of the whiteboard images. Particularly, the naturalness and legibility quality attributes of the images were investigated through psychovisual experiments. Our experimental results show that increasing color attributes such as saturation, brightness and luminance contrast, lead to more legible whiteboard contents; which in turn increases the whiteboard image quality. Enhancement processes of the whiteboard backgrounds, however, show strong effects on the naturalness attribute. But, when the general image quality is considered, observers tend to prefer more legible whiteboard image contents rather than the naturalness of the appearance.",60013141,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",21.142857142857142,0.21785714285714283,0.48333333333333334,1

The simulation results showed that as the current frequency increases or current intensity decreases, the distribution of the magnetic flux density in each vertical position of the crucible hardly changed, but the value of the magnetic flux density was gradually reduced, and the magnitude of the decrease was decremented from the maximum position of the magnetic flux density to the upper and lower ends. The maximum value of the magnetic flux density in different axial directions was proportional to the current intensity. In the radial direction, the magnetic flux density of the surface of the crucible was large, and gradually decreased toward the inner layer. The magnetic field at the slit was higher than the middle portion of the ridge due to the reinforcing effect at the slit. The small coil method was used to measure the actual electromagnetic field distribution in the crucible.

Across many countries systems with cutting-edge solutions have been introduced in order to enhance healthcare services throughout last years. However, in Iraq and Kurdistan region still there is a lack for such systems and particularly for clinics. Patients need to go through a time-consuming process which might require a considerable effort especially for the time of making appointment to the consultation hour. Moreover, the current available appointment systems come up with problems such as missing appointments by the patients due to the long queues given by clinics. By implementing technological solutions it’s possible to obtain benefits such as eliminating waiting lists, enhancing patient’s timely access to services and reducing no show problem. Therefore, we suggest creating a mobile application system to enhance the process of booking appointments at clinics. Thus, providing a mobile application tailored to the clinic’s needs is the main goals of this paper. Our approach is to design a prototype mobile system to facilitate the whole appointment process from the beginning to the end. The system will cover both client and clinics side.

The concept under study is the learning procedure between steps of amplification in order to predict the next high scale of resolution. The method integrates two different approaches for the prediction of a high resolution multi-scale scheme, a pure interpolation and a gradient regularization. In the first step a pure interpolation is carried out. It is used a prediction scheme with algebraic reconstruction through different scales to produce the high resolution output. In the last step, the residual blur is reduced by a gradient auto-regularization method. The gradients are adapted by using a weight in a neighbour. Precision of method can be controlled by the parameters of an algebraic reconstruction technique (ART).

To digitally reconstruct its original colors, we use an unprecedented broad scientific analysis and experimental art technological approach, by physically reconstructing oil paints of all pigments used by Van Gogh. We closely match the original paints, and for the first time determine all the optical properties involved. The investigation led to a digital image representing the original colors as good as possible. We found that for the digital color reconstruction it is important to take into account that museum lighting is often relatively dark in order to better preserve paintings. Since this affects the best way of representing the reconstructed colors on the display, we adapted the digital reconstructed image. We also corrected for the technical specifications of the electronic display on which the reconstructions will be displayed in the museum. Based on the reconstruction we conclude that the original colors in the painting used to be much brighter, and agreed much better with Van Gogh's own description of the color composition of this painting.

Current experimental means can only analyze the final hot tearing morphology of castings, and the initiation and growth of hot tears are difficult to observe. In order to predict the initiation and propagation of hot tears, the thermo-mechanical simulation of casting process was conducted by using a thermal elastoplastic finite element model. A new prediction method of hot tearing based on isothermal strain on high temperature was proposed, and the tearing initiation location of the casting was determined. Based on the results of thermal stress field of the casting, the growth of the hot tearing was simulated by the extended finite element method (XFEM) combined with the adaptively refined meshing and sub-model technology. The simulation results show that hot tears tend to occur at the isolated liquid boundary of the casting, and propagate along the solid-liquid interface. The predicted tearing is consistent with the hot tearing observed in the actual casting, both in terms of location and morphology, which proves the reliability of the numerical simulation of hot tears initiation and propagation.",60025761,Huazhong University of Science and Technology,Wuhan,China,['1702'],26.571428571428573,0.11296650717703349,0.6549760765550238,0

The breast cancer incidence rate in Asia appears to be 37.5% and the mortality rate is 13.21% according to 2012 world cancer report. As per the recent statistics report of 2018, it has been estimated that the count of new cases of breast cancer is 14% in India. The percentage is higher when compared to lung cancer, oral cancer and other type of cancer. It has been identified that it occurs mostly in the age group between 41-50 years and the distribution of this is found to be 42%, whereas it is 18%,24% for the age groups of 31-40 and 51-60 respectively. It has got five stages of Survival which includes the survival rate of 100%, 98%, 88%, 52%, 16% for each stage respectively. Diagnosis in the early stage can reduce the death rate, even during the stage 3 if the cancer is predicted it can be treated. Hence with the help of machine learning using artificial neural network, the cancer can be predicted.

801,801,Documenting architectural rationale using source code annotations: An exploratory study," All rights reserved.The architectural rationale is the documentation of the reasons why certain software design decisions are made that satisfy quality needs in a system. On many occasions this rationale is implicitly found in precise sentences of the system's documentation or the same source code, making it difficult to understand and make decisions on the maintenance phase, leading to a deviation and erosion of the architecture and therefore aging of the software. In this paper, we discuss the utility of a tool based on code annotations as an alternative to document the architectural rationale with the source code. For this, a quasi-experiment with local industry software engineers is done, in order to answer the research question: Does the source code annotations, with information about the architectural rationale, improves the software maintenance? The quasi-experiment is done with software engineers who know Java language and notions of software architectures. It included 3 tasks that involve changes to the architecture and its documentation. After the results were analyzed using the t-student test, concluding that the participants who use the annotations with information of the Architectural Rationale achieve a better understanding of the architecture and its Rationale than those using a traditional way for documenting the rationale(documents). However, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance time do not depend on the Rationale specification. With the same problem, the variation was due to the ability of individuals to develop software, but the documentation of the architecture, in general, was very important to be able to make the changes within the limits.",60051434,Universidad del Cauca,Popayan,Colombia,['1700'],32.0,0.1584065934065934,0.5285714285714286,0
802,802,The analysis of current state of agile software development,"The agile software development methods are studied in this paper. Agile software development methodology was formally represented to the community of software engineering through twelve principles and four core values. Agility is considered the cornerstone of the agile software development. This contrasts with the plan-driven technique that is explained in different conventional models (e.g. Waterfall). Currently, the agile development is an important development approach, which is derived from practical uses to encourage the cooperation between users and developers so that fast development processes could be supported, and to adapt with the modifications that are affecting the dynamic environment. Many agile methods are currently available in the literature with Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) methods forming two most commonly used methods. This study demonstrates the value of applying the agile methods in developing software projects by analysing the current agile methods. The study results reveal that the agile development introduces significant benefits over conventional methodologies. However, these benefits are not compatible with all projects and situations. The results also show a decline in the interest in XP, while the interest in Scrum is increasing all the time.",60110529,Saudi Electronic University,Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],16.909090909090907,0.25746753246753246,0.6207251082251083,1
803,803,Modeling lens optics and rendering virtual views from fisheye imagery,"Production of high-quality virtual reality content from real sensed data is a challenging task due to several factors such as calibration of multiple cameras and rendering of virtual views. In this paper, we present a pipeline that maximizes the performance of virtual view rendering from an imagery captured by a camera equipped with fisheye lens optics. While such optics offer a wide field-of-view, it also introduces specific distortions. These have to be taken into account while rendering virtual views for a target application (e.g., head-mounted displays). We integrate a generic camera model into a fast rendering pipeline where we can tune intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters along with resolution to meet the device or user requirements. We specifically target CPU-based implementation and quality in par with GPU-based rendering approaches. Using the adopted generic camera model, we numerically tabulate the required backward projection mapping and store it in a look-up table. This approach offers a tradeoff between memory and computational complexity in terms of operations for calculating the mapping values. Finally, we complement our method with an interpolator, which handles occlusions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the viability, robustness and accuracy of the proposed pipeline.",60011170,Tampereen Yliopisto,Tampere,Finland,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",19.3,0.0546875,0.325,1

805,805,Analyzing the behavior of bicyclists using a bicycle simulator with a coupled sumo and dyna4 simulated environment," All rights reserved.Operational behavior models are used in traffic simulations to represent the subconscious, short-term decisions made by road users to respond to other road users, the infrastructure and traffic control measures. Calibration and validation of these models can be achieved using observed trajectory data from real road users. For lane bound traffic, it is assumed that road users intend to follow a given lane with a certain desired speed across the intersection. Any deviation from this planned path is in response to other road users or the environment. It is difficult, however, to identify and separate the desired movement of more flexible road users that do not follow lane disciple, such as bicyclists, from movements made as a reaction to other road users or obstacles. This can lead to poor calibration of operational behavior models and unrealistic behavior in the simulation. Tactical behavior models recreate the conscious decisions made on a time horizon of seconds to minutes to cope with the immediate traffic situation . As such, tactical behavior models are responsible for selecting the planned path across an intersection. Here, SUMO is coupled with the simulation software DYNA4 to create a simulated road environment for a bicycle simulator. Trajectories observed in reality are displayed as potential prescribed pathways across the simulated intersection. Participants in the simulator study are instructed to select and follow one of the prescribed pathways as closely as possible while responding naturally to other road users and obstacles in the environment. The resulting trajectory data is used to calibrate existing operation al and tactical path finding behavior models for bicyclists at signalized intersection.",60019722,Technical University of Munich,Munich,Germany,['1700'],22.416666666666668,-0.04135338345864662,0.5300751879699248,0
806,806,On-street parked vehicle detection via view-normalized classifiers,"In this paper1, we propose a novel vision-based on-street parked vehicle detection method via view-normalized classifiers. Our method consists of two phases: (1) an offline process to train site-independent object classifiers and set various site-specific parameters and (2) a runtime process where streaming video frames are analyzed to determine the occupancy of the parking site. We incorporate temporal filtering, view-normalization, and temporal correlation into a core computer vision-based parked vehicle detection method to achieve real-time determination of on-street parking occupancy. Our method combines image processing techniques with machine learning to yield efficient and accurate results. It does not require site specific re-training of the classifiers and thus is most suitable for large deployment or for quick parking occupancy surveys covering a wide-area of interest. Two experiments are conducted. The first experiment consists of six cameras monitoring a block of a street. The results show that our method is robust against site variations as well as camera variations. The other experiment is a small-scale deployment, where 11 cameras are used to monitor four blockfaces of a city. The results confirm that our method can achieve adequate accuracy without re-training of vehicle classifiers or refinement of parameters.",60027165,University of Rochester,Rochester,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",19.5,0.1550865800865801,0.49805194805194797,1

Context-sensitive sentiment classification methods determine the polarity of the sentiment terms by considering the contexts of the target word. Most of the present techniques consider only product-level, user-level contexts for sentiment classification.

826,826,Deformation stability in superplastic forming at the sheet-die interface," Published by Elsevier B.V.The superplastic forming process has many industrial applications; however the slow nature of the process is impeding its popularity. In theory, it should be possible to design an optimum pressure profile that generates a strain rate path with the highest possible strain rates while at the same time mitigating necking. This can be accomplished by incorporating certain sheet stability criteria in a model of the process. As a first step towards this goal, in this study, the target is to determine the limit strain in a sheet being superplastic formed at a constant strain rate taking into consideration the friction at the sheet-die interface. The geometry of the formed part was chosen to be a long rectangular box, in order to benefit from the plane strain state that exists in most of the sheet during the forming process. The results show that the limit strain highly depends on the dimensions of the assumed non-homogeneity.",60104134,Khalifa University of Science and Technology,Abu Dhabi,United Arab Emirates,['1702'],26.333333333333332,0.16725274725274725,0.5463919413919414,0
827,827,Modelling bicycle infrastructure in sumo," All rights reserved.Bicycle traffic is becoming an increasingly important part of urban traffic. Thus, the simulation and accurate representation of bicycle traffic in microscopic traffic simulation software is gaining importance. As bicycle traffic increases, dedicated bicycle infrastructure is designed to accommodate bicycle traffic. Especially at intersections, the design of intersection approaches follows specific rules and geometric limitations as defined by official design guidelines used in different countries across the world. However, when special environmental factors that affect the intersection layout, such as available space or gradient are not considered, specific standard forms of intersection approaches can be determined based on the number of traffic lanes, the traffic signal control and in the case of this study, the availability as well as the type of dedicated bicycle infrastructure. Categories with available bicycle infrastructure include the cases of bicycle lanes or advisory cycle lanes with advance stop lines for direct left turning bicyclists, the bicycle lanes or advisory bicycle lanes with bicycle boxes and bicycle lanes or bicycle paths with advanced stop lines and a stop area downstream for facilitating an indirect left turn or a two-stage (left) turn of bicyclists. The simulation of such bicycle infrastructure is not natively supported in microscopic traffic simulation software and is mostly only possible through intuitive adjustment of existing network design elements. In this paper, fictional intersections with special bicycle infrastructure are modelled in SUMO. Bicycle traffic data is collected at intersections in Germany with different types of bicycle infrastructure. The collected bicycle traffic data is then used to evaluate the intersection models. Specific recommendations for modelling bicycle infrastructure at intersection approaches in SUMO are provided, and limitations of the proposed methodologies and software limitations are discussed. Results show that the developed solutions can be used to model the bicycle traffic behavior with a reasonable degree of accuracy only for simulation scenarios and traffic situations unaffected by the identified software limitations.",60019722,Technical University of Munich,Munich,Germany,['1700'],26.416666666666668,0.12118226600985224,0.4569376026272578,0

Different schemes of multilevel phase mask (MPM) forming by combining pixels of two Fresnel lenses are analyzed. The Fresnel lenses are calculated for the same focal distance but for very different wavelengths. A possibility of adding to the optimized mask a cubic component is taking into account as well as usage of discrete phase masks with optimized number of levels. It is shown that the proposed approach in the combination with inverse imaging allows to significantly increase image quality for a focus distance in comparison to refractive lens-based optical systems. Moreover, it is shown that by changing of aforementioned parameters it is possible to increase or decrease DoF value depending from a given goal of optimization. It is demonstrated by numerical analysis that the proposed approach significantly increases robustness of designed MPM to Gaussian additive noise in MPM introduced due to fabrication errors.",60011170,Tampereen Yliopisto,Tampere,Finland,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",24.285714285714285,0.078125,0.57875,1

For our statistical study, various types of high dynamic range content that have been provided by studios or content providers are considered.

835,835,Illumination invariant NIR face recognition using directional visibility,"Biometric face recognition technology has received substantial attention in the past several years due to its potential for a wide variety of applications in both law enforcement and non-law enforcement fields. However, most current face recognition systems are designed for indoor and cooperative-user applications. Moreover, ambient lighting fluctuates greatly between days and among indoor and outdoor environments. Furthermore, illumination is the most significant factor affecting the appearance of faces. Most existing systems, academic and commercial, are compromised in accuracy by changes in environmental illumination. Furthermore, state-of-the-art techniques designed to combat this issue have very low accuracy. This paper attempts to combat the issue by proposing an illumination invariant near infrared face recognition architecture that consists of (1) generating a sequence of directional visibility images using quadrant and circular filters, (2) extracting Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features, and (3) performing SVM based classification. This technique a) improves the accuracy of the face recognition system, b) works under illumination variations, and c) does not need registration of face information.

The selection criteria were based on attributes such as type of development, development platform, and programming language generation as suggested by the ISBSG. Since a lower size of data set is generated as mentioned criteria are observed, it avoids a good generalization for models. Therefore, in this study, a statistical analysis of data sets was performed with the objective of knowing if they could be pooled instead of using them as separated data sets. Results showed that there was no difference among the DD of new projects nor among the DD of enhancement projects, but there was a difference between the DD of new and enhancement projects.

Normally, an accidental explosion may occur if the flammable gas that has been insufficiently ventilated in an enclosed period for a long period of time comes in contact with the high temperature surface of the bulb. Methods/Statistical analysis: Thus, under the context of lighting, ensuring the safety of these areas requires excellent level of rigidity and strength of the surface of lighting components, especially the explosion-proof lighting devices. The present study discussed the designs of the base model and three modification models of explosion-proof devices and compared the analyses of their stiffness and strength yields. Findings: As a result of the analysis, the design of Case 3 was changed from that of the basic model to make the steel construction system excellent in the stiffness value. In addition, due to its high strength, the design was changed to the Case 3 so that explosion-proof LED are safe even in case of accidents such as gas explosion.

In this study we propose to apply machine learning to phase extraction, which has been generally performed by a sequence of several rule-based algorithms. In order to estimate a phase-shift image, we employ supervised learning in which input is an interferogram and output is the phase-shift image, and both are simulation data.

Methods/Statistical analysis: CNN, one of the deep learning methods, are widely used because of its excellent performance in image processing. In this paper, we propose a new frame synchronization method by transforming the frame synchronization problem into CNN problem. Specifically, the correlator output for frame synchronization is transformed into a 2D image and input to the CNN, and the CNN finds a frame or packet starting point. Findings: Conventional frame synchronization methods recognize the start of a frame when the correlator output exceeds a certain threshold. However, since the optimal threshold must be determined as a function of SNR, it is a burden of estimating SNR of the received signal before performing frame synchronization. However, the proposed frame synchronization based on CNN does not need SNR estimation and shows better performance than the conventional method.

To investigate the noise suppression effect of 120-fps operation, we measured the random noise of the pixel readout circuit to the sampling number M and compared with theoretical calculations. As a result, we confirmed that the measurement result corresponds reasonably well with the calculated result and the sampling number M = 6 is effective for noise suppression. Furthermore, the calculations revealed that the influence of 1/f noise of the source follower is dominant on the noise performance.",60103907,Nippon Hoso Kyokai,Tokyo,Japan,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",22.333333333333332,0.08979591836734693,0.44897959183673475,1
851,851,Efficient deep learning-based network for crack detection in pipeline systems,"Crack detection is a crucial problem in many tasks such as inspection conditions of concrete pipes or tunnels, diagnosing structural damages, ensuring road safety and so on. Thus, vision-based crack detection had attracted researchers recently, and many approaches for crack detection had been proposed. However, it remains a great challenging task due to the intensity inhomogeneity of cracks and complexity of the background. Inspire by the fast development of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) in image processing recently, we propose a multi-scale deep convolutional network based on encoder-decoder architecture. More specific, our network is based on SegNet network, which is a deep convolutional encoder-decoder architecture designed for pixel-wise semantic segmentation. We first discard the softmax layer in the SegNet network, and then build enhanced modules based on the convolution feature maps from encoder and decoder network. Furthermore, we adopt the focal loss function instead of cross-entropy loss in the original SegNet network to focus on learning the hard examples and down-weighting the numerous easy negatives. Experimental results on public datasets show that our network achieves better results compared to other state-of-the-art methods on crack detection.",60107781,Industrial University of Ho Chi Minh City,Ho Chi Minh City,Viet Nam,['1700'],23.125,0.1706666666666667,0.486,1
852,852,Visual noise revision for ISO 15739,"With the publication of the second edition of the ISO 15739 Standard [1] in 2013 the measurement of “visual noise” became a normative part of the standard. Over the years the algorithm has proven to be useful and reliable for the judgement of the visibility of noise in images captured by digital cameras. Nevertheless a few aspects of the measurement procedures were questioned by some experts like e.g. the relation of the contrast sensitivity function (csf) for the luminance and the two chrominance channels. And the resulting weighting factors for the three channels also depend on the csf relation. In addition, some experts would like to use the more common CIELAB space instead of CIELUV. For these reasons the responsible ISO technical committee 42 working group 18 is looking into a revision of the visual noise section of the standard.

ARIA’s primary functionalities are the following: event creation, event scheduling, event management, user management, document processing, and payment processing. Prior to the creation of ARIA, these functionalities were performed using-paper methods. This approach was tedious, inefficient, and prone to errors. The previous versions of ARIA (1.0/2.0) were developed to address these issues using the WordPress platform and WordPress plugins. While successful, new business requirements proposed by NNMTA have demonstrated that WordPress may not be a feasible software platform for all of NNMTA’s needs going forward. To ensure that ARIA can advance with NNMTA, ARIA 3.0 was developed using an “as-is” and “to-be” design approach. We built a microservice application which supports the implementation of features that NNMTA would like to maintain from previous versions while simultaneously providing a platform suitable for future software requirements.

862,862,Equipping decoy generation algorithms for template-free protein structure prediction with maps of the protein conformation space," All rights reserved.A central challenge in template-free protein structure prediction is controlling the quality of computed tertiary structures also known as decoys. Given the size, dimensionality, and inherent characteristics of the protein structure space, this is non-trivial. The current mechanism employed by decoy generation algorithms relies on generating as many decoys as can be afforded. This is impractical and uninformed by any metrics of interest on a decoy dataset. In this paper, we propose to equip a decoy generation algorithm with an evolving map of the protein structure space. The map utilizes low-dimensional representations of protein structure and serves as a memory whose granularity can be controlled. Evaluations on diverse target sequences show that drastic reductions in storage do not sacrifice decoy quality, indicating the promise of the proposed mechanism for decoy generation algorithms in template-free protein structure prediction.",60018319,"George Mason University, Fairfax Campus",Fairfax,United States,['1700'],20.0,0.16666666666666666,0.3833333333333333,0

Research model and research hypotheses were set up, and surveys were conducted for the personnel in charge of security work at the airport. Methods/Statistical analysis: In order to analyze the effect of job security anxiety on turnover intention and job satisfaction, this study was conducted to survey employees who are in charge of security search at airport. The study period was from November 6, 2017 to November 17, 2017 for about 2 weeks. In the questionnaire, the variables were divided into three categories: ""First, job anxiety, Second, turnover intention, Third, job satisfaction"". Findings: Prior to this study, previous studies have examined the employment insecurity, turnover intention and job satisfaction of aviation security search workers. Research hypotheses have examined the effects of employment insecurity on job turnover and job satisfaction. Analysis results showed that employment insecurity affects turnover intention and turnover intention affects job satisfaction. However, employment anxiety did not directly affect job satisfaction, so it was explained that employment stability was not linked to job satisfaction. Therefore, it is analyzed that more attention should be paid to the turnover intention before the employment anxiety is resolved.

Methods/Statistical analysis: In this study, CT specimensconformedwith ASTM(E647) and ISO Standards were designed. The finite element analyseswere carried out. In order to examine the reaction force to the displacement of specimen, the top of specimen was pulled by1 mm/min on Z-axis direction and the bottom of specimen was fixed. With the designed CT specimens, thephenomena of buckling modes are analyzed with the modal analysis technique. Findings: As silicon steel is the rolled steel sheet, its rolling and transverse directions must be checked.It is necessary to examine the different fracture behavior of CT specimen by section. Before final fracture, It first has a buckling phenomenon and goes through the period of plasticity. The specimen stacked in more than two layers was made in order to investigate the material property in the direction of its thickness and estimate its stress and deformation. The specimen was divided into multiple sections in it and designed its layers in the direction of thickness. Each section was constructed with hexahedrons to create the dense mesh structure. A constraint condition was given: the top and bottom of the specimen were constrained by pins while given a rotational DOFto move in Z-axis direction. The speed of forced displacement was set to 1 mm/min and the interference between the elements was minimized. And the mesh was differently structured for each section of the specimen to enhance the efficiency of the analysis.

866,866,Investigation of the fibre type influence on the energy density of the induction heating process through a semi-analytic method," Published by Elsevier B.V.The study investigated the induction welding of carbon fibre-reinforced Polyamide 66 with different types of carbon fibres and fabrics. The major scope of the study was the plastification of the thermoplastic matrix as the first process step of the continuous induction welding. A new semi-analytic method was created to simulate the dependence of the plastification parameters (induction coil, power, weld velocity and coil-workpiece distance) on the fibre and fabric. Numerical and physical methods of Duhovic [1] and Velthuis [2] were used to investigate the complete process of plastification and consolidation. This kind of simulation uses the principle of the finite element method (FEM) [1]. The calculated results are strongly influenced on the one hand by the simplification of the thermal conductivity of the fibre and the matrix in the composite material (constant shape value, constant beam value) and on the other hand by the parameterization of the heat source. The semi-analytic method uses the radial basic function and the physical correlation between the thermal losses and the induced eddy currents at the electric conductive carbon fibers for the calculations. The calibration of the tool was done by testing a series of plastification parameters for different kinds of fibre and fabrics. In-situ temperature measurements through thermocouples and pyrometer were carried out for the melt zone in addition to destructive testing of the resulting joint. Yarlagadda [3] and Ahmed [4] have investigated the induction heating of carbon fibres and have shown three kinds of heating mechanisms: Joule loss/fibre heating, junction heating/dielectric hysteresis heating and junction heating/contact resistance heating. The simulation model investigated the amount of heating based on these three mechanisms.

The fatigue properties of materials are closely related to service conditions and heat treatment processes. In this paper, the service conditions of typical hot extrusion punches were selected as the start point, loading history of the dangerous part of the die was obtained by finite element numerical simulation. The load spectrum modified and normalized through Neuber algorithm was used as the loading curve of fatigue analysis. The tensile properties of the die materials at service temperature were obtained by experiments. Based on the Manson-Coffin model, the strain-life curve of the material was obtained through the theoretical deduction. The fatigue failure prediction model was established based on strain damage. Aiming at specific working conditions of aluminum alloy extrusion parts, the fatigue life prediction and model validation of the die were carried out. The heat treatment of die was: spheroidizing annealing + 1020 ? oil quenching + 580 ?× 2 h two tempering treatment. The results show that the die life predicted by the model is 1318 times, and the actual die life is 1120 times, the failure position and service life of the die are in good agreement with the predicted results.

It is of great significance to reduce the processing flow of bearing rings for saving energy and material, increasing productivity. In this work, one step warm extrusion processing using ring blank as preform was proposed to form bearing ring which possesses upper and lower rings. The upper and lower rings are formed by materials reverse and forward flow during warm extrusion, respectively, and the ratio of materials reverse flow amount to forward flow amount (RRFA) determines the formability of bearing rings. In order to process bearing rings at optimum RRFA at which the upper and lower rings can be simultaneously formed, finite element models for the warm extrusion processing were established based on DEFORM-3D software. The effect of extrusion ratio, round corner radius of extrusion die, extrusion temperature, friction coefficient on the flow rules of materials was analyzed by the developed finite element models. The results show that small extrusion ratio (i.e. small outer diameter of ring blank) and large round corner radius of extrusion die enhance the material flowing into lower ring and facilitate the forming of lower ring. Extrusion temperature and friction coefficient have little effect on RRFA. Comprehensively considering the flow rules of materials, the well-formed bearing rings can be obtained when extrusion ratio is 2.33, round corner radius of extrusion die is 1.5, extrusion temperature is 700-800 °C.",60073460,China University of Mining and Technology,Xuzhou,China,['1702'],23.5,0.12032312925170069,0.3704081632653062,0

879,879,Real-time accurate rendering of color and texture of car coatings,"The digital representation of three dimensional objects with different materials has become common not only in the games and movie industry, but also in designer software, e-commerce and other applications. Although the rendered images often seem to be realistic, a closer look reveals that their color accuracy is often insufficient for critical applications. Storage of the angle-dependent color properties of metallic coatings and other gonio-apparent materials demands large amounts of data. Apart from that, also rendering sparkle, gloss and other visual texture phenomena is still a subject of active research. Current approaches are computationally very demanding, and require manual ad-hoc setting of many model parameters. In this paper, we describe a new approach to solve these problems. We combine a multi-spectral physics-based approach to make BRDF representation more efficient. We also account for the common loss in color accuracy due to the varying technical specifications of displays, and we correct for the influence from ambient lighting. The rendering framework presented here is shown to be capable of rendering sparkle and gloss as well, based on objective measurement of these properties. This takes out the subjective phase of manual fine-tuning of model parameters that is characteristic for many current rendering approaches. A feasibility test with the new spectral rendering pipeline shows that is indeed able to produce realistic rendering of color, sparkle, gloss and other texture aspects. The computation time is small enough to make the rendering real-time on an iPad 2017, i.e. with low memory footprint and without high demands on graphic card or data storage.",60024415,Akzo Nobel N.V.,Amsterdam,Netherlands,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",19.692307692307693,0.04396227581941868,0.4184094001236859,1

In the behavior of melt convective, different orientations of dendrites hinder the convective flow of the melt. And a special segregation channel may be formed between the dendrites to cause solidification defects. In this study, a numerical model for accurately calculating three-dimensional dendrite growth in superalloy melt convection is proposed. And a 27-point solute field discretization scheme is used to discretize the dendrite growth model in multi-physical field. Then, the model is solved by using the in-situ grid technique and SIMPLE algorithm. The results of numerical simulation are similar to those of LGK analysis and Oseen-Ivantsov solution, which verifies the practicability and effectiveness of the model algorithm to a certain extent.

Since the light field camera capture both the spatial and angular light ray, we can estimate a depth map throughout that properties of light field image. However, estimating a depth map from the light field image has a limitation in term of short baseline and low resolution issues. Even though many approach have been developed, but they still have a clear flaw in computation cost and depth value accuracy. In this paper, we propose a network-based and epipolar plane image (EPI) light field depth estimation technique. Since the light field image consists of many sub-aperture images in a 2D spatial plane, we can stack the sub-aperture images in different directions to handle occlusion problem. However, usually used many light field sub-aperture images are not enough to construct huge datasets. To increase the number of sub-aperture images for stacking, we train the network with augmented light field datasets.

892,892,Pupil detection and tracking for AR 3D under various circumstances," This paper aims to develop a robust, automated algorithm and system for detection and tracking of pupil centers of a user using a single visual camera and near-infrared (NIR) leds under dynamic driving circumstances. Our proposed pupil tracker consists of eye-nose detection, keypoint alignment, and tracking with NIR led on/off control depending on illumination conditions. Eye-nose detection, which utilizes an error reinforcement learning method for selecting best learning DB, generates facial sub-region boxes including eyes and nose. The error reinforcement learning method uses only a small fraction (less than 5%) of the training DB, while improving the detection rate. Based on the detected region, eye-nose alignment including pupil centers are then processed by Supervised Descent Method (SDM) with Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Then, the pupil centers are tracked with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and SIFT feature based tracking checker, which guarantees the aligned results contains pupil centers. This can be considered a different feature space and a strong classifier used in the eye-nose detection stage, such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and a set of weak classifiers (Adaboosting). However, the proposed pupil tracker cannot be applied under low light conditions. To achieve this, we add NIR leds and S/W functions to control the intensity of the NIR. After recognizing the contents of the pupil image, such as low light conditions, wearing eyeglasses or sunglasses, corresponding designated aligners are applied. We achieve fairly high detection rate (98%) and precise eye alignment (average error 2mm) even with challenging conditions, such as day and nighttime driving conditions.",60010484,Samsung Group,Suwon,South Korea,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",23.272727272727273,0.09914078674948242,0.449824016563147,0

Land mammal assemblages can profitably be used in the paleogeographic reconstructions. The late Miocene assemblages form Central Italy and Sardinia allowed the recognition of the Tusco-Sardinia bioprovince as an isular domain for the endemic character of the fauna. The same conclusion has been reached for the Apulo-Abruzzi bioprovince, considered as an island during late Miocene. The recent studies on the mammal assemblage from Cessaniti (Calabria) revealed a continental character of the fauna, probably related to a land connection to Africa.

After that, oil quenching was performed at 130 °C for microstructure and martensitic transformation. Gas carburized specimens were cut vertically with vacuum wire cuts to minimize deformation and microstructural changes. The cut specimens were resin-mounted at a temperature of 185 °C, followed by rough grinding, intermediate grinding and polishing grinding in order to make the surface as smooth as possible. XRD and EPMA were used to confirm the presence of microstructure, crystal structure, carbon and alloying elements of the metal microstructures of the uncarburized specimens and the gas carburized specimens.

902,902,Bridging the gap between sumo & kuksa: Using a traffic simulator for testing cloud-based connected vehicle services," All rights reserved.The emerging usage of connected vehicles promises new business models and a high level of innovation, but also poses new challenges for the automotive domain and in particular for the connectivity dimension, i. e. the connection between vehicles and cloud environments including the architecture of such systems. Among other challenges, IoT Cloud platforms and their services have to scale with the number of vehicles on the road to provide functionality in a reliable way, especially when dealing with safety-related functions. Testing the scalability, functionality, and availability of IoT Cloud platform architectures for connected vehicles requires data from real world scenarios instead of hypothetical data sets to ensure both the proper functionality of distinct connected vehicle services and that the architecture scales with a varying number of vehicles. However, the closed and proprietary nature of current connected vehicle solutions aggravate the availability of both vehicle data and test environments to evaluate different architectures and cloud solutions. Thus, this paper introduces an approach for connecting the Eclipse SUMO traffic simulation with the open source connected vehicle ecosystem Eclipse Kuksa. More precisely, Eclipse SUMO is used to simulate traffic scenarios including microscopic properties like the position or emission. The generated data of each vehicle is then be sent to the message gateway of the Kuksa IoT Cloud platform and delegated to an according example service that consumes the data.

The testing of an SoC for manufacturing defects is an important task due to IC design complexity, further, it also affects the final cost of the chip. Due to the high complexity involved in SoC test scheduling, various techniques were suggested to reduce the testing time. This paper introduces a novel SoC test scheduling technique based on a Modified Ant Colony Optimization (MACO) algorithm. The testing is performed on the benchmark circuits of ITC’02. The experiments performed on d695 and p22810 SoC benchmark circuits. The results show that the MACO algorithm can achieve reduced test time compared to the ACO algorithm. When compared with ACO, the proposed algorithm MACO reduces the testing time by 47% and 10% for d695 and p22810 SoC benchmark circuits respectively.",60078480,Velalar College of Engineering and Technology,Erode,India,['1706'],17.555555555555557,0.06154761904761905,0.4670238095238095,0
904,904,Investigation of the effect of pupil diameter on visual acuity using a neuro-physiological model of the human eye," One of the most important physical parameters affecting its value is the pupil diameter, which follows changes in the surrounding illumination by adaptation. Thus, the direct measurement of its influence on visual performance would require either medicaments or inconvenient apertures placed in front of the subjects' eyes to examine different pupil sizes, so it has not been studied in detail yet. In order to analyze this effect directly, without any external intervention, we accomplished simulations by our complex neuro-physiological vision model. It considers subjects as ideal observers limited by optical and neural filtering, as well as neural noise, and represents character recognition by template-matching. Using the model, we reconstructed the monocular visual acuity of real subjects with optical filtering calculated from the measured wavefront aberration of their eyes. According to our simulations, 1 mm alteration in the pupil diameter causes 0.05 logMAR change in the visual acuity value on average. Our result is in good agreement with former clinical experience derived indirectly from measurements that had independently analyzed the effect of background illumination on pupil size and on visual quality.",60030035,Budapest University of Technology and Economics,Budapest,Hungary,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",25.857142857142858,0.09421768707482994,0.36241496598639455,0

906,906,Residual stresses prediction on clad pipeline girth welds through numerical simulation," Published by Elsevier B.V.It is generally known that different welding processes induce residual stresses into the weld joints, which may have a negative impact on fatigue and durability or other aspects of the in-service performance. This effect is of high interest in offshore pipeline girth welds, since they are typically not subjected to PWHT (Post Weld Heat Treatment). Although different methods of experimental measurements of the residual stresses are available their application in real context is extremely challenging or not convenient for several reasons, as a matter of example often the weld location and surface can make it problematic to access with the equipment, the execution of the measurements in a true non-destructive way is not feasible or more simply the execution of weld samples with very expensive equipment as the one used in offshore pipelines is not economical. In addition to this the stress field within or in the proximity of welds is of very complex and variable character and there appears a high level of plasticity, which makes the interpretation of local experimental measurements very difficult. For these reasons the prediction of residual stresses using numerical simulation of the welding process is today a very interesting and cost-efficient alternative. In this paper authors present the work where thermo-metallurgical and mechanical analysis of the thermal effects of the welding process using FEM based solver SYSWELD was done in order to determine residual stress field after girth welding of pipes made of carbon steel grade API 5LD X65 with internal alloy 625 cladding. The simulated process involves the execution of several external weld passes in gas metal arc welding technology and root re-melting with plasma arc welding process. Further variant simulations of the process were executed in order to evaluate the impact on residual stress field changing selected process parameters, namely the welding sequence. The use of numerical simulation finally allowed a deeper understanding of residual stresses field generation phenomena for the specific and quite complex welding process conditions.",60105855,Saipem S.p.A.,San Donato Milanese,Italy,['1702'],36.666666666666664,0.02220430107526883,0.45700460829493084,0
907,907,Connecting molecular energy landscape analysis with markov model-based analysis of equilibrium structural dynamics," All rights reserved.Molecular dynamics simulation software now provides us with a view of the structure space accessed by a molecule. Increasingly, Markov state models are proposed to integrate various simulations of a molecule and extract its equilibrium structural dynamics. The approach relies on organizing the structures accessed in simulation into states as an attempt to identify thermodynamically-stable and semi-stable (macro)states among which transitions can then be quantified. Typically, off-the-shelf clustering algorithms are used for this purpose. In this paper, we investigate two additional complementary approaches to state identification that rely on graph embeddings of the structures. In particular, we show that doing so allows revealing basins in the energy landscape associated with the accessed structure space. Moreover, we demonstrate that basins, directly tied to stable and semi-stable states, yield to a better model of dynamics on a proof-of-concept application.",60018319,"George Mason University, Fairfax Campus",Fairfax,United States,['1700'],20.0,0.12,0.44666666666666666,0

In the existing systems, hardware is more operative than the software.The processor-based software which processed earlier has a major disadvantage on the term of an algorithm, it is not effective on dealing with huge volume of data and also on achieving the overall efficiency.On the big data analyses, hardware support is important in order to overcome the real-time issues.The major data mining task to be performed in big data analytics is clustering.It makes the relationship between the object s by means of the similarity and categorizes the data into meaningful groups.In this work, a novel k-means algorithm is proposed to minimize the running time.This algorithm has simple and scalable parallel architecture, which is easy to implement on FPGA-based parallel processing architecture also.This implementation is more efficient for K-means Clustering system on dealing with the big data.It is also applicable for reconfigurable hardware platform such as FPGA, known for the real-time clustering applications.The proposed system is implemented on our hardware design with the benchmark dataset, in order to prove its feasibility and efficiency.

Methods/Statistical analysis: The core architecture consistsof SRAM, for implementing the SRAM-PUF and the Ring Oscillator. These two primitive PUFs are used as the building blocks to constructing the proposed Composite-PUF architecture. This proposed architecturereveals an improvement in thereliability and uniqueness:-the main statistical measure of the quality of a PUF. The architecture was modeledand simulated with Verilog HDL and Modelsim SE Integrated Development Environment tools. Findings: Silicon-based random functions that depend on the physical properties of the silicon manufacturing process, also known as Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF), provide primitives based on challenge-response pairs. These PUFs in conjunction with certain lightweight block and stream ciphers are some of the means of securing these devices holistically. The forms of hardware attacks get varied and sophisticated with each passing time especially with the availability of higher computing power and other forms of advanced technologies. This presupposes that there are still attacks that can be or are being leveled against some of these PUFs.This research proposes a composite-PUF architecture that is complex, possess a high degree of reliability and uniqueness and is equally highly suitable and easily implemented on FPGAs to enhance their security.

Instead, only an off-the-shelf laser level is utilized to cast the laser planes toward the scene to generate image features for the calibration based on the principle of projective geometry. With proper alignment of laser level, smooth laser curves can be obtained in the fish-eye image, and the principal center of the camera can be found by intersecting two straight laser lines in the fish-eye image. Other curved laser lines can then be used to measure the calibration data for the correction of radial distortion.

912,912,Investigation of pinched hysteresis of a memristor emulator under ferroresonance,"The frequent occurrence of ferroresonance phenomenon has destructive effects in distribution systems. The jump resonance accompanied by harmonics can be effectively mitigated using a nonlinear component. The upcoming memristor technology is applied in this work to control the ferroresonance in an inductive voltage transformer, which is used in a distribution substation. Due to noncommercialization of memristors, an emulator in the form of an electrolytic cell is developed. The set-up uses saturated copper sulfate (CuSO4) solution as the electrolyte and copper electrodes having different cross sectional areas. Nonlinearity is realized in the form of the pinched hysteresis loop in the developed memristor emulator. The required memristance is obtained by using a proper design of the CuSO4 set-up. The nonlinear resonance is indicated by the sudden jump up of 30 V and jump down of 15 V in the secondary winding of the transformer. The current-voltage relation of the emulator is compared with that of an ideal memristor under normal and ferroresonance conditions.

The demosaicing and JPEG image compression algorithms may greatly amplify the impact of two defective pixels within a 5x5 pixel box, spreading it into a 16x16 pixel box thus resulting in a very noticeable image degradation. We develop both analytical (generalized birthday problem formula) and Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the number of hot pixels required to achieve a given probability of having two defective pixels occur within a 5x5 square. For a 20 Mpix DSLR camera (360 mm2) only 128 hot pixels generate a 4% probability of two such defective pixels, which for pixels of size 4 μm may occur in 1.4 years at ISO 6400, and in 3.2 years at ISO 3200.",60018491,Simon Fraser University,Burnaby,Canada,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",46.25,0.22000000000000003,0.6,0

Since today’s entrepreneurship deals with heterogeneous groups, the norms and values that govern interactions and relationships among people and institutions must be given due emphasis. In recent years there is growing empirical evidence that social capital contributes significantly to development and sustainability. However, literature on the role of social capital in enhancing the performance of the entrepreneurial university in Malaysia is scarce and perhaps almost absent. The main objective of this study is to identify the impacts of social capital towards the performance of an entrepreneurial university. Specifically, this study focuses on exploring the potentials of social capital in enhancing the performance of the entrepreneurial university in Malaysia through four main elements namely: trust, networking, shared values and shared vision.

917,917,Controlling a real-world intersection with connected vehicle information provided by cams (Cooperative awareness messages)," All rights reserved.The project MAVEN (see https://www.maven-ts.eu), funded by the European Commission, aims at developing a system for infrastructure-assisted platoon organization and green phase negotiation for automated connected vehicles (ACVs). Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication protocols are hereby used for the insertion of vehicles into a traffic simulation of a real-world intersection. Until now, real world traffic could be inserted into a simulation through stationary detectors, for example magnet field sensors, induction loops, cameras, radar etc. The downside of this detection method is that only momentary information can be obtained and e.g. the behavior of the vehicles approaching an intersection can only be approximated. ACVs however continuously broadcast their positions and speeds via CAMs. Detecting vehicles though these messages leads to a more realistic representation of the vehicle’s driving behavior. The current paper describes how CAMs are used to place and move ACVs inside the simulation of a real-world intersection in Braunschweig with the traffic simulation SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). Furthermore, it describes an approach to how these continuously detected vehicles could be further used as control units. Since the positions and speeds of ACVs are synchronized with the real-world behavior, they can be used to adjust the simulated upstream movements and positioning of conventional vehicles (CV) to match reality. Until all vehicles are equipped with V2X technology, this approach could enable more realistic simulated traffic flow behavior.",60007798,Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- Und Raumfahrt,Cologne,Germany,['1700'],20.727272727272727,0.08503401360544217,0.3945578231292517,0

Soils are the main component of the country's land resources that ensure agricultural productivity and perform important environmental functions [1]. The high importance of the soil necessitates the creation of optimal mechanisms to regulate their use. In the period of the centrally-planned economy and state monopoly of land inventory of soils, development of regulatory documents on the protection and use has been connected. The role of state institutions in regulating land-use was high: only the state could systematically consider all aspects of the properties and functioning of soils. The situation changed in a variety of forms of land ownership and diversity of independent economic objects. Sorry, currently we have to admit that the system of state control soil resources, management almost destroyed. Soil resources are associated with the concept of ""land"", where it acts as property in the system of cadastre of real estate.

As of March 2019, the population of senior citizens aged 65 and older reached 14.9 percent, and with this trend, the country expects to enter a super-aged society that exceeds 20 percent by 2025. At the same time, Alzheimer's disease is one of the major diseases that detract from the cognitive abilities of older people. In response, the government is planning to develop contents for dementia improvement service using sonar vibration.

930,930,Augmenting scalable communication-based role allocation for a three-role task,"In evolutionary robotics role allocation studies, it is common that the role assumed by each robot is strongly associated with specific local conditions, which may compromise scalability and robustness because of the dependency on those conditions. To increase scalability, communication has been proposed as a means for robots to exchange signals that represent roles. This idea was successfully applied to evolve communication-based role allocation for a two-role task, with one communication channel. However, it was necessary to reward signal differentiation in the fitness function, which is a serious limitation as it does not generalize to tasks where the number of roles is unknown a priori. We show that rewarding signal differentiation is not necessary to evolve communication-based role allocation strategies for the referred two-role task, and we improve reported scalability, while requiring less a priori knowledge. We extend the previous work to a three-role task and we propose and compare two cognitive architectures, to increase the number of communication channels, and several fitness functions to evolve scalable controllers.

The different microstructure of the two TiAl alloy was analyzed, the main reason of the difference is their different segregation pattern, in the Ti45Al2Cr2Nb alloy the s-segregation is the dominating pattern while in the Ti45Al4Cr2.5Nb ßsegregation is the dominating pattern, which cause the discrepancy distribution of B2 phase and independent ? phase in the two alloy. In the Ti45Al2Cr2Nb the B2 phase distribute in the lamellar colony and in the Ti45Al4Cr2.5Nb the B2 phase distribute in the boundary of the lamellar colony. Besides, the different microstructure also influence the mechanical property, the brittle B2 phase in the lamellar colony break the continuity of the lamellar and the boundary of B2 could act as the source of the crack during deformation. In the tensile test the ultimate tensile strength of the Ti45Al2Cr2Nb and Ti45Al4Cr2.5Nb alloy are 347 MPa and 539 MPa respectively.

951,951,Verification of closed-loop systems with neural network controllers," All rights reserved.This benchmark suite presents a detailed description of a series of closed-loop control systems with artificial neural network controllers. In many applications, feed-forward neural networks are heavily involved in the implementation of controllers by learning and representing control laws through several methods such as model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL). The type of networks that we consider in this manuscript are feed-forward neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a linear activation function in the output layer. While neural network controllers have been able to achieve desirable performance in many contexts, they also present a unique challenge in that it is difficult to provide any guarantees about the correctness of their behavior or reason about the stability a system that employs their use. Thus, from a controls perspective, it is necessary to verify them in conjunction with their corresponding plants in closed-loop. While there have been a handful of works proposed towards the verification of closed-loop systems with feed-forward neural network controllers, this area still lacks attention and a unified set of benchmark examples on which verification techniques can be evaluated and compared. Thus, to this end, we present a range of closed-loop control systems ranging from two to six state variables, and a range of controllers with sizes in the range of eleven neurons to a few hundred neurons in more complex systems.",60003915,Vanderbilt University,Nashville,United States,['1700'],33.42857142857143,0.04490740740740741,0.48379629629629634,0
952,952,"A referenceless image quality assessment based on BSIF, CLBP, LPQ, and LCP texture descriptors","In the last decades, many researchers have developed algorithms that estimate the quality of a visual content (videos or images). Among them, one recent trend is the use of texture descriptors. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of using Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF), the Local Configuration Pattern (LCP), the Complete Local Binary Pattern (CLBP), and the Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) descriptors to design a referenceless image quality assessment (RIQA) method. These descriptors have been successfully used in computer vision applications, but their use in image quality assessment has not yet been thoroughly investigated. With this goal, we use a framework that extracts the statistics of these descriptors and maps them into quality scores using a regression approach. Results show that many of the descriptors achieve a good accuracy performance, outperforming other state-of-the-art RIQA methods.

The high atomic number Bi nanoparticles in the solution show surface plasmon resonance effects, high mass absorption coefficient for soft X-ray interaction and high electron and nuclear stopping powers for electrons and ion beams. This biocompatible solution can be injected into living systems, such as mice, in order to study the up-take effect in different organs with a high contrast spatial localization of the X-ray images in the tissues in which the nanoparticles are confined. The high contrast medium for high-resolution imaging in biological systems can be also used as targeting for successive exposure to ionizing radiation during radiotherapy or hyperthermia of diseased cells.

According to the kinematics and dynamics models of welding mobile robot, the seam tracking error system is established considering the external disturbance. Meanwhile, the terminal sliding mode controller (TSMC) is designed to achieve the convergence of the tracking errors in finite time. The new saturation function is used to eliminate the effect of chattering instead of the sign function. Then the Lyapunov stability theory indicates that the closed-loop system is stable. Compared with the linear sliding mode controller (LSMC), the proposed non-smooth controller can offer not only a faster convergence rate but also a higher tracking accuracy.

The two novel components for 2D image features are the projected local patch and the visibility of each landmark. First, we propose to extract the landmark related features in the projected local patches on 2D image from the corresponding 3D face model. Local patches of a fixed landmark in 3D face models for different 2D images cover the same region of face anatomically. The extracted features are more accurate for further locations regression of landmarks. Second, we propose to estimate the visibilities of 2D landmarks based on 3D face model, which are proven to be vital to address large pose face alignment problem. In this paper, we adopt Local Binary Features (LBF) to extract landmark related features in the proposed framework, and name the new method as 3D-Assisted LBF (3DALBF).

However, the existing methods have some limitations for detecting 1-D barcodes in various backgrounds including tassels, stripes, and clustered text in fashion images. In this research, our focus is on identifying the barcodes in fashion images and distinguishing the barcode from similar non-barcode image content. It is accomplished by applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve this typical objective detection problem. A comparison of the performance between our algorithm and a previous method will be given in our results. Also, a traditional method based on hand-crafted features will be proposed for comparison.

961,961,Pixelwise JPEG compression detection and quality factor estimation based on convolutional neural network,"JPEG compression is one of image degradations that often occurs in image storing and retouching process. Estimating JPEG compression degradation property is important for JPEG deblocking algorithm and image forensic analysis. JPEG degradation exists not only in JPEG file format but also in other image formats because JPEG distortion remains after converting to another image format. Moreover, JPEG degradation property is not always uniform within an image in case that the image is collaged from different JPEG-compressed photos. In this paper, pixelwise detection of JPEG-compression degradation and estimation of JPEG quality factor using a convolutional neural network is proposed. The proposed network outputs an estimated JPEG quality factor map and a compression flag map from an input image. Experimental results show that the proposed network successfully infers the quality factors and discriminates between non-JPEG-compressed images and JPEG-compressed images. We also demonstrate that the proposed network can spot a collaged region in a fake image which is comprised of images that have different JPEG compression properties. Additionally, the network reveals that image datasets Set5 and Set14, often used to evaluate super-resolution algorithms, contain JPEG-compressed low quality images, which are inappropriate for such evaluation.",60031126,Tokyo Institute of Technology,Tokyo,Japan,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",21.333333333333332,0.0625,0.6725,1

965,965,Strip end flip during finishing rolling under misalignment conditions of work roll pair," Published by Elsevier B.V.Misalignment in the assembly of finishing rolls in the mill stand housing often leads to instability of the strip during finish rolling such as snake motion, side walk and strip end flip. Among these problems, the strip end flip is the most serious one. It often occurs upon steel strip end being released from the roll bite of a previous mill stand and being further fed into the next stand. As a result, it may cause folding of the strip end and/or result in serious damage on the finishing roll surface. This would significantly deteriorate the strip quality and cause serious consequence in production. Due to irregularity of occurrence and difficulty in on-site observation, this phenomenon has been a troublesome issue in finishing rolling. The aim of this work was to analyze the effect of the misalignment of the finishing work rolls on the incidence of strip end flip and to postulate possible mechanisms in interpreting the strip end flip phenomenon under misaligned conditions. By adopting the camber condition from a particular on-site strip end and by assuming different degree of misalignment of work roll pair, the numerical model not only predicted the strip end shape, but also reproduced and visualized the strip end flip. The simulated results showed that the occurrence of strip end flip was primarily due to the collision of the strip end side with the side guide arms and was susceptible to the misaligned conditions of the work roll pair. The numerical model provides an effective tool to systematically explore the possible causes of the strip end flip. With appropriated measures, the occurrence of strip end flip can thus be limited and reduced.",60032850,China Steel Corporation Kaohsiung,Kaohsiung,Taiwan,['1702'],25.545454545454547,0.008531746031746036,0.5648809523809523,0

Knowledge of residual stresses and their distribution makes it possible to predict the behavior of metal products under operating loads and to prevent their possible destruction. In this regard, it is necessary to adjust the main parameters of the drawing process, including the geometry of the die channel. The work is devoted to the study of residual stresses arising from inhomogeneity of plastic deformation depending on the reduction value and the die angle. Computer simulation of wire drawing process by finite element method is performed. The distributions of residual stress tensor components along the wire radius are calculated for different values of reduction and die angle. The analysis of the obtained relations is carried out.

Two approximations in complete information tables are extended to handle incomplete information. Consequently, four approximations are obtained: certain and possible lower ones and certain and possible upper ones without computational complexity. These extended approximations create the same results as the ones from possible world semantics by using possible indiscernibility relations. Therefore, the extension is justified. In complete information tables two types of single rules that an object supports are obtained: consistent and inconsistent ones. The single rule has low applicability. To increase applicability, a series of single rules are brought into one combined rule with an interval value. In incomplete information tables four kinds of single rules are obtained. From them, four kinds of combined rules are obtained: certain and consistent, possible and consistent, certain and inconsistent, and possible inconsistent ones.

Findings: Of the 182 respondents, 71 (39%) therapists reported that UERE had usability problems, and 89 (48.9%) reported they needed improvement. The presence rate of nine UEREs were 36.8%– 96.7% and the usability experience was 33.5%–95.6%. UERE's usability problems and improvement needs were higher with higher clinical experience and higher in university and general hospital workers than in rehabilitation hospital workers. Usability problems for UERE had two main problems. The therapist responded that UERE was not interesting to use and that various control adjustable functions were designed to be difficult. The response to the improvement needs was reported to be level adjustable and various control adjustable. Improvements/Applications: These findings suggest that occupational therapists see problems with and require improvements in UEREs. Thesemay be the basis for future development of UERE.",60031231,Semyung University,Jecheon,South Korea,['1700'],17.0,0.001282051282051286,0.44294871794871793,1
977,977,Development of ultrasonic transducer for subcutaneous fat removal,"In this study, it was aimed to efficiently disassociate subcutaneous fat by arranging ultrasonic transducer so that ultrasound energy can be focused at a certain distance in order to remove subcutaneous fat efficiently. The intensity of the transducer having a diameter of 10 mm at a frequency of 3 MHz takes 2.6 seconds to decompose the fat when the ultrasound is focused. Organs at risk of necrosis were about 1 minute and 20 seconds longer than fat decomposition, so no damage to organs was worried. Considering the energy concentration and the temperature rise rate considering the treatment time, 3MHz was the most appropriate. Considering X0, it was considered efficient to select a vibrator having a diameter of 5 mm, but it was not easy to obtain a vibrator having an actual diameter of 5 mm. Therefore, a transducer array was designed using a vibrator with a diameter of 10 mm, and proper energy could be focused by adjusting the output intensity.",60024495,Catholic Kwandong University,Gangneung,South Korea,['1700'],26.833333333333332,0.1662698412698413,0.43412698412698414,1
978,978,Determining location of wormhole attacks in wireless sensor networks using patrol nodes,"One of the dangerous and common attacks against wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is wormhole. In this attack, an adversary established two malicious nodes in two areas of the network environment which are far from each other and creates a particular and high-speed link between these two nodes as wormhole channel. This attack has an adverse effect on routing algorithms. Malicious nodes at both ends of the wormhole channel exchange messages of two areas which are far from each other, as a result of which nodes of these areas considered to be neighbors. In this study, an algorithm is proposed to handle the wormhole attack in WSNs. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to collect spatial and neighborhood information by mobile patrol nodes in the network environment to detect malicious nodes. In the proposed algorithm, there are a number of patrol nodes whichwalkin the network and gather required information from different points of the network to detect wormhole attack. The proposed algorithm is simulated and its efficiency is evaluated in terms of detection rate and location estimation of malicious nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to detect 100% of malicious nodes which is favorable compared to the basic algorithm.",122264924,Faculty of Electrical Engineering,Malacca,Malaysia,['1700'],22.666666666666668,-0.010606060606060608,0.5606060606060606,1
979,979,Paint code identification using mobile color detector," However, as many automobile manufacturers use different and proprietary naming conventions to these codes, it can be challenging for a normal person to find the specific type of paint applied to a vehicle. In this paper, we facilitate this process by developing a portable mobile system to detect paint codes for vehicles. To determine the best matching paint code using the images captured by a mobile device, several practical issues should be examined. First of all, multiple images are captured through the camera viewfinder and the same collection of pixel values are computed collectively to estimate the most accurate color across a short period of time. Second, all pixels in a square region centered on the selected spot are sampled for color estimation to achieve the best match. Finally, in case multiple matches are detected, the closest match should be displayed to the user first, followed by the next closest values. Extensive experiments demonstrate the color detection and matching functionality of our system is robust against varying lighting environments. The scope of this work can be further expanded to other painting industries such as furniture making and construction.",60022636,Frostburg State University,Frostburg,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",23.625,0.1923913043478261,0.36557971014492746,0

981,981,Reinforcement learning agent under partial observability for traffic light control in presence of gridlocks," All rights reserved.Bangkok is notorious for its chronic traffic congestion due to the rapid urbanization and the haphazard city plan. The Sathorn Road network area stands to be one of the most critical areas where gridlocks are a normal occurrence during rush hours. This stems from the high volume of demand imposed by the dense geographical placement of 3 big educational institutions and the insufficient link capacity with strict routes. Current solutions place heavy reliance on human traffic control expertises to prevent and disentangle gridlocks by consecutively releasing each queue length spillback through inter-junction coordination. A calibrated dataset of the Sathorn Road network area in a microscopic road traffic simulation package SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) is provided in the work of Chula-Sathorn SUMO Simulator (Chula-SSS). In this paper, we aim to utilize the Chula-SSS dataset with extended vehicle flows and gridlocks in order to further optimize the present traffic signal control policies with reinforcement learning approaches by an artificial agent. Reinforcement learning has been successful in a variety of domains over the past few years. While a number of researches exist on using reinforcement learning with adaptive traffic light control, existing studies often lack pragmatic considerations concerning application to the physical world especially for the traffic system infrastructure in developing countries, which suffer from constraints imposed from economic factors. The resultant limitation of the agent’s partial observability of the whole network state at any specific time is imperative and cannot be overlooked. With such partial observability constraints, this paper has reported an investigation on applying the Ape-X Deep Q-Network agent at the critical junction in the morning rush hours from 6 AM to 9 AM with practically occasional presence of gridlocks. The obtainable results have shown a potential value of the agent’s ability to learn despite physical limitations in the traffic light control at the considered intersection within the Sathorn gridlock area. This suggests a possibility of further investigations on agent applicability in trying to mitigate complex interconnected gridlocks in the future.",60028190,Chulalongkorn University,Bangkok,Thailand,['1700'],27.833333333333332,0.014861111111111115,0.43543650793650795,0

983,983,A Hidden Markov Model based prediction mechanism for cluster head selection in WSN,"Energy is an important resource and requires efficient management and utilization. Energy conservation is fundamental concern for designing in WSN. Clustering is an effective technique for energy conservation in WSN. With the increase in large scale networks, the need of energy aware and efficient clustering algorithms is rising. The efficacy of clustering depends on appropriate selection of ClusterHead(CH). The rotation of CH involves gathering energy levels of the nodes in every round; this augments the cost of cluster Head rotation. In this paper, a Prediction Based CH Selection (PBCS) algorithm is proposed which uses combined Particle Swarm optimization to form clusters and Hidden Markov Model based technique to choose the (CH) based on predicted energy level of nodes.

This study reviewed the content of Korean magazine advertising from 1995 to 2015 using the content analysis method. Findings: The present article found that the number of Korean magazine advertisements with a foreign language was not significantly different longitudinally from the 1990s to the 2010s. The results of the three research questions showed that there was not a significant change in the usage of foreign languages in the studied years. However, the results of this study showed that there was a significant difference in the advertising appeal of using foreign languages in general women’s magazines. The results also showed that Korean magazine advertising used foreign language in anappropriate way, which implies that using foreign language is more effective than using domestic language for informing and persuading consumers in a market.

The set of empirical parameters of the model was obtained basing on the experimental data on kinetics of austenitization under continuous heating of various microstructures of 8 industrial steel grades with wide range of chemical compositions (?(0.08÷0.66), Mn(0.37÷1.55), Si(0.20÷0.56), Cr(0.10÷1.08), Ni(0.06÷1.94), Mo(0.01÷0.52), Nb(0.003÷0.041), V(0.002÷0.15), Ti(0.002÷0.063) (mass.%)), as well as on the final austenite grain size. In the initial state steels had pearlitic, ferritic-pearlitic, ferritic-bainitic, bainitic-martensitic and other more complex microstructures.

990,990,Background subtraction using multi-channel fused lasso,"Background subtraction is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Despite having made significant progress over the past decade, accurate foreground extraction in complex scenarios is still challenging. Recently, sparse signal recovery has attracted a considerable attention due to the fact that moving objects in videos are sparse. Considering the coherent of the foreground in spatial and temporal domain, many works use the structured sparsity or fused sparsity to regularize the foreground signals. However, existing methods ignore the group prior of foreground signals on multi-channels (such as the RGB). In fact, a pixel should be considered as a multi-channel signal. If a pixel is equal to the adjacent ones that means all the three RGB coefficients should be equal. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Channel Fused Lasso regularizer to explore the smoothness of multi-channels signals. The proposed method is validated on various challenging video sequences.

Experimental or numerical simulation can be utilized to examine these computational models. Though, because of the colossal expenses needed in the experimental method, the numerical method has been deemed to be more suitable. Current paper presents the modelling and simulating procedures of computational fluid vibrant (CFD) issue regarding an aeroplane wing model, employing normal serving as NACA 0012 airfoil. The design procedure is grasped out in CATIA-V5®.ANSYS Fluent is utilized to examine the pressure and velocity allocation on the wing’s external.

In addition, both drag and lift powers’ coefficients could be computed across information analyzed after the relative velocity inlet between the airflow and airfoil adjustments from 0 to 50 m/s. Examination of whole wing’s flow features were done throughout various angles of attack [0°,5°,15°,25°,35° to 45°]. The observation of the discovery of these cases has revealed that MODEL 1 wings generates better CL/CDratio achievement compared to the other 2 model.

In this work, we employed temperature gradient zone melting (TGZM) to investigate the microstructure evolution of Co-93wt.%Sb alloy in mushy zone under different thermal stabilization time. Due to the existence of temperature gradient, two mushy zones between complete liquid phase region and solid phase region were observed. There exists a solute gradient across the mushy zone and the solute diffuses from the cold side to the hot side, inducing that the liquid droplet migrates up the temperature gradient. As the thermal stabilization time increases, the volume fraction of the liquid in mushy zone decreases, and the initial solid/liquid interface moves downwards paralleling to the temperature gradient. After 4h thermal stabilization time, the solute concentration is higher in liquid zone than the nominal alloy concentration, and lower in the mushy zone measured by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS).

997,997,Multi-target tracking with an event-based vision sensor and a partial-update GMPHD filter," Such targets necessitate very high tracker update rates to keep up with meandering and mutually-occluding target paths. Event-based vision sensors may offer a solution to this problem as they report only “event-based” pixelwise changes in intensity as they occur with a time resolution approaching 1 µs [1], providing data that is much sparser and higher in time-resolution than traditional vision systems. However, this class of sensor presents unique challenges; for example, a single object in the sensor's field of view may produce multiple synchronous or nearly-synchronous events. In addition, performing direct measurement-to-track association for event data on µs to ms timescales introduces problematic computational burdens for scenarios involving large numbers of targets. The work described in this paper is twofold. We first define and apply an event-clustering procedure to raw events to reduce the amount of data passed into the tracker. This transformation from events to event-clusters provides a) discrimination between event-clusters that correspond to true targets and those that do not and b) reduction in tracking computation time. Second, we define and apply a partial-update Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GMPHD) filter [2] for tracking using event-cluster data. We demonstrate increased computational performance over the standard GMPHD filter while achieving comparable tracking performance per the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) metric [3].",60015720,Marquette University,Milwaukee,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",23.666666666666668,0.09676987718164189,0.41998405516052584,0

They change parameter values, re-execute the calculation, add objects, change technological solution, modify or add hypotheses, etc. The different concepts manipulate often components whose interactions are essential for a good functioning of the system and an economic execution of the design process. In fact, most of components do not reply solely to one desired function, but participate also to the behavior of the system and the geometrical definition of the other components. In mechanical design, all of these functionalities have to be taken in consideration by the definition of relationships between objects. This paper proposes a design methodology for automatic configuration of kinematic chain of multi-spindle drilling boxes.

Considering the austenite at elevated temperature in the 3d track of Fe's t state, there must have more valence electrons, those forms the equivalent p' electrons, so Fe must be of type B hybrid. The austenite is selected in the 11th order of B-type hybridization, and the theoretical bond length and its difference with experiment bond length are respectively calculated. When the austenite is in the 11th order of the B-type hybrid, the bond length difference obtained by the above calculation method is less than 0.05 Å, so that the above calculation is satisfactory within the first-order approximation range. According to the above method, the 12th order, the 13th order and the 14th order of the austenite B type hybrid are calculated too, and their binding energy of austenite are calculated by substituting the formula of the binding energy of Yu Ruihuang, and the best final error compared with the experimental value is less than 1.30%.",60073587,Henan University of Science and Technology,Luoyang,China,['1702'],34.57142857142857,0.1610416666666667,0.2847916666666667,0

This proposed methodology is named as HRR-MPLS-MANET. The effective routing over the MPLS based MANET created by considering distance, residual energy and the number of hops. By considering these parameters, the optimum path is generated and it is used for obtaining the effective bandwidth from the MPLS based MANET. The performance of this HRR-MPLS-MANET methodologyanalysed in terms of bandwidth, end to end delay, alive nodes, dead nodes, energy consumption and throughput. To evaluate the performance of HRR-MPLS-MANET, it is compared with HCR-AODV and AAODV.

1001,1001,Enhancement of colloidal stability of drug nanocarriers in complex biological environment,"In recent years the development of novel approaches for the production of nano-formulations (nanocarriers) for efficient transport of drug molecules in living systems offers a wide range of biotechnology applications. However, despite the remarkable developments of recent synthetic methodologies, most of all nanocarrier's action is associated with a number of unwanted side effects that diminish their efficient use in nanomedicine. This highlights some critical issues in the design and engineering of nanocarrier systems for biotechnology applications, arising from the complex environment and multiform interactions established within the specific biological media. Many questions still remain open for what concerns the way to deal with the complexity of the biological processes involved. What is the minimal number of key parameters (and their related key factors) required to describe behavior of nanomaterials without sacrificing the complexity of the identified process? In other words, what is the “minimum level of complexity” to assume in the theoretical and experimental models that may satisfactorily describe the nanocarriers (and nanomaterials) interaction with biological systems. Herein, we analyze relevant open questions with the aim of offering possible perspectives for the development of next-generation nanomaterials that are able to overcome the critical issues during their action in complex biological media.",60021199,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,Rome,Italy,['1700'],33.5,0.08173076923076925,0.4913461538461539,1

This resource is indispensable for, and greatly contributes to, sentiment analysis tasks. This is evident in the emergence of a large volume of research devoted to the development of automated sentiment lexicon generation models. The task of tagging sentiment-bearing words with a positive or negative connotation, and sometimes with a strength, comprises of two core approaches: the dictionary-based approach and the corpus-based approach. The former involves making use of a digital dictionary to tag words, while the latter relies on co-occurrence statistics or syntactic patterns embedded in text corpora. The end result is a linguistic resource comprising a priori information about words, across the semantic dimension of sentiment. This paper contributes to the existing literature by providing a survey on the most prominent research works that have employed lexical resources, dictionaries and thesauri for sentiment lexicon generation.

The whole network is made up of two modules, among which the first one is a face feature embedding module and the second one is the face feature aggregation module. The first module is a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which maps each of the face images to a fixed-dimensional vector. The second module is also a CNN which is trained to be able to automatically assess the quality of input face images and thus assign various weights to the images' corresponding feature vectors. Then the one aggregated feature vector representing the input set is formed inside the convex hull formed by the input single face image features. Due to the mechanism that quality assessment is invariant to the order of one image in a set and the number of images in the set, the aggregation is invariant to these factors. Our CAN is trained with standard classification loss without any other supervision information and we found that our network is automatically attracted to high quality face images, while repelling low quality images, such as blurred, blocked, and non-frontal face images.

It involves, among other, interactions of mRNA with miRNA-a small (21-25 nt) single–stranded non–coding RNA molecule. Its main function is post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression leading to gene silencing. It is achieved either by inhibition of translation or by degradation of mRNA. The detailed mechanisms employed include inhibition of attaching the 60s ribosomal subunit, premature ribosome drop-off or inhibition of protein elongation process, cleavage of mRNA or destabilization of mRNA. Another mechanism of regulation of gene expression involves reactive oxygen species (ROS-radical and non-radical oxygen species formed by the partial reduction of oxygen) which, being released from mitochondrium cytochrome C and inducing DNA damage, induce the apop-tosis pathway.

In the most conventional methods, the image is divided into small regions and estimated the local illuminant in each region by applying the methods for one illuminant. By unifying the derived local illuminants, scene illuminants are estimated. The methods for one illuminant used in the conventional ones are typically gray-world, white-patch, first-order and second-order gray-edge, and so on. However, these methods are not modified properly. Therefore, they have possibilities for improving in illuminant color estimation. Proposed method is gray-world based and applies to each small region to estimate the local illuminant. There are two features in the methods. The first feature is the selection of the small regions; the method uses criteria for the regions whether they satisfy the gray-world assumption and estimates the local illuminants in the selected small ones. The second one is the use of multi-layered small regions; in general, appropriate size of the small region depends on the image, thus, several-sized small regions corresponding to the resolution are used and unified.

Image features that correlate with aesthetic quality are extracted and utilized in a machine learning algorithm. With a regression output predicting a popularity score on a scale of 0 to 1 our method proves to be a concise yet effective approach to predicting the aesthetic quality of fashion images. Our models proved effective and promising for future research. Our base model, trained with our entire dataset, resulted in an error value of only 18% in the most successful application.

The temperature field of laser tailored blanks was numerically simulated under the conventional condition and External Thermal Action (ETA). The thermal cycle curve of welded joints was compared and analyzed, and the influence of welding power and welding speed on the welding width was analyzed. The results show that, under ETA condition, the cooling rate of weld and heat affected zone decreases greatly, and the residence time above the phase transition temperature becomes longer. And it is conducive to the homogenization of austenite structure at high temperature and the coordination of mechanical properties of welded joints. In addition, under the same welding power, the welding width of ETA is wider than that of conventional welding, and the larger the welding speed is, the smaller the welding width is. In order to ensure the penetration of welding, the welding speed should between 2mm/s and 7mm/s.",60019616,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China,['1702'],27.0,0.0703896103896104,0.3208441558441559,0
1025,1025,An efficient motion correction method for frequency-domain images based on fast robust correlation," Motion during data acquisition can produce blurred images and artifacts. The calculation load for previous motion correction methods is relatively high. In order to decrease computational complexity, an efficient motion correction method is proposed based on fast robust correlation. Fast robust correlation is a computationally efficient search algorithm for translational image matching in the frequency domain. This method calculates the matching surface using a series of high-speed correlations by defining a kernel with sinusoidal terms. The proposed method corrects motion distorted images by aligning translational motion between images formed by neighboring frequency segments. Due to the ineffectiveness of the squared difference kernel to detect motion between partial-Fourier images, the absolute value kernel is proposed, which can be easily approximated by sinusoidal terms. Total variation of the sum of partial-Fourier images is chosen as the new match criterion. FFTs are used to calculate correlations for computational speed. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce image motion artifacts effectively and efficiently.",60011754,Auburn University,Auburn,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",16.2,0.15800275482093665,0.583595041322314,0
1026,1026,Effect of Convection on Equiaxed Solidification of Ni-based alloy," Published by Elsevier B.V.It has been found that the crystal morphology during equiaxed solidification can be strongly changed by the applied physical fields, such as the electromagnetic field, ultrasonic treatment or mechanical stirring. Theoretically, the applied external fields cause melt flow to impact the crystal growth and thus change the solidification structure. However, the previous relevant works mainly focused on obtaining grain refinement rather than studying the crystal morphology evolution. To study the equiaxed solidification under forced convection, the crystal growth in multidirectional flow was numerically simulated in the present work. The simulation results indicate the flow direction of forced convection strongly impacts the crystal growth and the morphology evolution. The multidirectional flow would cause much different conditions during the equiaxed solidification, which eventually changes the crystal morphology. In the present study, the different cooling conditions were used to study the impact of solidification process parameters. For the case of simulation with small heat transfer coefficient, corresponding to the low cooling rate for practical solidification processes, the effects of the forced convection on crystal growth is more significant than that with larger cooling coefficient.",60020745,Institute of Metal Research Chinese Academy of Sciences,Shenyang,China,['1702'],23.125,0.047222222222222214,0.3849773242630385,0
1027,1027,Automatic shadow detection using hyperspectral data for terrain classification," Hyperspectral imaging systems utilize sensors, which acquire data mostly from the visible through the near infrared wavelength ranges and capture tens up to hundreds of spectral bands. Using the detailed spectral information, the possibility of accurately classifying materials is increased. Unfortunately conventional spectral cameras sensors use spatial or spectral scanning during acquisition which is only suitable for static scenes like earth observation. In dynamic scenarios, such as in autonomous driving applications, the acquisition of the entire hyperspectral cube in one step is mandatory. To allow hyperspectral classification and enhance terrain drivability analysis for autonomous driving we investigate the eligibility of novel mosaic-snapshot based hyperspectral cameras. These cameras capture an entire hyperspectral cube without requiring moving parts or line-scanning. The sensor is mounted on a vehicle in a driving scenario in rough terrain with dynamic scenes. The captured hyperspectral data is used for terrain classification utilizing machine learning techniques. A major problem, however, is the presence of shadows in captured scenes, which degrades the classification results. We present and test methods to automatically detect shadows by taking advantage of the near-infrared (NIR) part of spectrum to build shadow maps. By utilizing these shadow maps a classifier may be able to produce better results and avoid misclassifications due to shadows. The approaches are tested on our new hand-labeled hyperspectral dataset, acquired by driving through suburban areas, with several hyperspectral snapshot-mosaic cameras.",60006429,Universität Koblenz-Landau,Koblenz am Rhein,Germany,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",19.166666666666668,0.17004193722943725,0.4845147907647908,0

1032,1032,Edge/region fusion network for scene labeling in infrared imagery," Currently, most state-of-the-art algorithms rely on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to perform this task. DCNNs are able to down-sample the spatial resolution of the input image into low resolution feature mappings which are then up-sampled to produce the segmented images. However, the reduction of this spatial information causes the high frequency details of the image to be lessened resulting in blurry and inaccurate object boundaries. In order to improve this limitation, we propose combining a DCNN used for semantic segmentation with semantic boundary information. This is done using a multi-task approach by incorporating a boundary detection network into the encoder decoder architecture SegNet. This multi-task approach includes the addition of an edge class to the SegNet architecture. In doing so, the multi-task learning network is provided more information, thus improving segmentation accuracy, specifically boundary delineation. This approach was tested on the RGB-NIR Scene dataset. Compared to using SegNet alone, we observe increased boundary segmentation accuracies using this approach. We are able to show that the addition of a boundary detection information significantly improves the semantic segmentation results of a DCNN.",60008609,University of Dayton,Dayton,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",18.2,0.316875,0.545625,0

These conversations in online forums for example can contain data that may help assist in the discovery of cyber threat intelligence. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is information or knowledge about threats that can help prevent security breaches in cyberspace. In addition, monitoring and analysis of this data manually is challenging because forum posts and other data on the darknet are high in volume and unstructured. This paper uses descriptive analytics and predicative analytics using machine learning on forum posts dataset from darknet to discover valuable cyber threat intelligence. The IBM Watson Analytics and WEKA machine learning tool were used. Watson Analytics showed trends and relationships in the data. WEKA provided machine learning models to classify the type of exploits targeted by hackers from the form posts. The results showed that Crypter, Password cracker and RATs (Remote Administration Tools), buffer overflow exploit tools, and Keylogger system exploits tools were the most common in the darknet and that there are influential authors who are frequent in the forums. In addition, machine learning helps build classifiers for exploit types. The Random Forest classifier provided a higher accuracy than the Random Tree and Naïve Bayes classifiers.

The phenomenological equations for these fluid mixtures are derived and, in the linear case, a generalized Debye equation for dielectric relaxation phenomena is derived. Special cases are also treated.

The processes of isothermal forging were studied by numerical simulation using Deform 3D in order to clarify the effect of the die profile and processing parameters on the forming of the thin-walled, cup-shaped component. The simulation results showed that closed-die forging with optimized die profile was the most satisfactory process due to better filling property, minimized forging flash, and higher dimensional accuracy. Based on the simulation, the material flow and thermomechanical field variables including stress, strain, and strain rate were obtained. The results indicated that the effective stress in the billet during plastic flow was quite low so the requirement for the forging load and die strength was not stringent. In the present study, the microstructure evolution during the forging process was also characterized by evaluating the dynamic recrystallization fraction in different regions within the forged component based on the established critical condition and the kinetic model with respect to the thermal deformation behavior of 6A02 aluminum alloy.

1047,1047,Experimental and numerical simulation on laser welding of high manganese TWIP980 Steel," Published by Elsevier B.V.In this paper, the numerical simulation of laser tailoring process for the 2mm thickness TWIP980 steel sheet is carried out using Simufact welding software. The results show that the center of the laser welding heat source is small, and temperature is high. The front of the weld pool has a drop-shaped profile and a funnel-shaped cross section. The simulated weld joint has a high degree of conformity comparing to the actual weld joint. As the heat input (line energy) increases, the peak temperature of the thermal cycle and the weldment width increase. The simulated results indicate that the residual stress of the weld joint perpendicular to the weld along the surface is greater than that along the weld direction, and are both greater than the residual stress perpendicular to the weld along the thickness direction. The residual stress generated by welding is mainly concentrated in the direction perpendicular to the weld seam. With the heat input increase, the deformation after welding increases. For the studied TWIP980 steel, the recommending laser tailored blank (LTB) weld parameters are: power 3kW and welding speed 3m/min, which is the optimum welding process in the practical welding.

1048,1048,Integration of wind connection low frequency ac transmission system using back to back converters,"The demand for worldwide electricity is projected to keep growing. As we know that resources are very limited, it is very important to save them for future generation in many aspects. One such limited element is land. We have 1/3 rd of earth is with the land and rest is covered with water. Since we have shortage of space everything cannot be done on the land itself. Now a day in developing countries power is the main demand and generation of power is done in very large scale which needs more land and equipment which leads to high capital investment. Keeping these points in view off shore wind power generation is proposed. By using off shore wind we can generate bulk amount of power generation. But it is facing high economical and technical challenges. The budget for offshore wind power has usually been higher than that of onshore wind generation, but costs have been decreasing quickly in recent years and in Europe has been price economical with conventional power sources since 2017. The common off shore wind farms are grid connected via High Voltage AC (HVAC) transmission, the present researchers and industry experts are concentrating on cost effective transmission alternatives to present technologies. The future of transmission system focuses on finding the alternatives to transmit the maximum power at less cost. A novel Low Frequency AC (LFAC) Transmission System has proposed for transmission of bulk power over long distance (>100kms) by using an intermediate frequency with low investment cost. This manuscript presents the one of the best approach of Low frequency AC transmission system technology interface the wind. The Low Frequency AC transmission system uses a 1/3rdof nominal frequency (20Hz/16.666Hz) than regular frequency (60Hz/50Hz) of main grids. The LFAC transmission was designed with Back-2-BackVSCs are selected as the most appropriate choice due to the technical benefits of Voltage Source Converters (VSC). An analysis to limit the optimum frequency for LFAC determines that between 100 km and 200 km the frequency lies in the range 20-16.67 Hz, showing the potential for LFAC. The design, analysis and voltage control of the B2B converter based offshore wind connected LFAC system is modeled in Simscapein MATLAB.",60010618,"Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore",Vellore,India,['1700'],20.11111111111111,0.14264346764346764,0.40764393725932196,1
1049,1049,Creating a simulation option for the reconstruction of ancient documents: Palimpsests,"Ancient documents were often created by overwriting older documents that had been erased to re-use the expensive parchment. There is thus the situation that we have valuable documents that actually contain possibly more valuable documents “underneath”, hidden to the human eye. Being able to retrieve these originals is an important task, however, associated with several problems. One of these is that the value of the documents limits the distribution and thus the ability to experiment. Another is that the “to be discovered” underwriting might hold important information that should first be examined, classified and put into context by textual scholars, again severely limiting the ability to experiment. This is a strong decrement to scientists and students involved in developing and testing imaging algorithms. This paper describes an approach to create artificial palimpsests that are reasonable approximations based on previous example and thus can be used by everybody to test new assumptions, new algorithms and to study the interaction of the different deterioration mechanisms.",60001777,Rochester Institute of Technology,Rochester,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",23.285714285714285,0.09385521885521883,0.5018939393939393,1

Since detecting collisions is such a core functionality of intelligent vehicles, redundancy is key. Therefore, we explore the use of stereo vision for reliable collision prediction. Our algorithm consists of a Bayesian histogram filter that provides the probability of collision for multiple interception regions and angles towards the vehicle. This could additionally be fused with other sources of information in larger systems. Our algorithm builds upon the disparity Stixel World that has been developed for efficient automotive vision applications. Combined with image flow and uncertainty modeling, our system samples and propagates asteroids, which are dynamic particles that can be utilized for collision prediction.

To do this, we try to compare the cases of three departments’ competency mapping to courses. Methods/Statistical analysis: Students' perceptions of the importance and performance level of major competency were compared. And they were also compared with competency ratios in three department’s competency-based curriculum. To do this, the questionnaires were collected from the students at three departments of counseling psychology & social welfare, dental hygiene and sports science. The collected questionnaires were analyzed by t-test and IPA (Importance-Performance Analysis) using SPSS 24.0 program. Findings: The results were derived from the case study of competency-based curriculum in three departments. First, characteristics of competency-based curriculums in three departments are classified according to the characteristics of competency ratio. Competency mapping characteristics of competency-based curriculum are classified into three types according to competency-ratio characteristics; balanced type of curriculum and extra curriculum or core competency and major competency, the major competency centered-type, and the core competency centered-type. The competency balance mapping type has a relatively balanced ratio of core competency and major competency in the subject area. It has been shown that core competency is designed to be higher than those of specialization.Second, as a result of comparing the competency emphasized by the department and students' perceptions, the two departments (counseling psychology, dental hygiene) agreed on the competency emphasized by the department and the competency recognized by the students.

1054,1054,A flow instability criterion for alloys during hot deformation," Published by Elsevier B.V.Flow instability is an intrinsic behavior of materials, especially during hot deformation, and it will be intensified and propagate internal defects, and finally lead to various damages in the significant perturbation. Some phenomenological models in the literature could present the flow instability behavior, but not available for describing the microstructure changes. To overcome this problem, we introduce a dissipation potential as a function of the plastic strain rate, the dislocation density rate, and the heat transfer rate, 𝐷(𝜺̇𝑝, 𝜌̇𝑑is, 𝒒; 𝜀, 𝜌𝑑is, 𝜃), coupled with strain, dislocation density, and temperature as the boundary condition to record the microstructure evolution and describe the flow instability. In this function, the stored energy rate marks the dislocation density evolution, i.e., the transient microstructure changes, and one parameter 𝜂𝑀, is introduced to evaluate the efficiency of metallurgy. And the flow instability criterion is derived from the principles of maximum dissipation (or maximum entropy production rate) and orthogonality proposed by HANS ZIEGLER. We obtain the necessary conditions of the flow instability are that the dissipation potential is with entirely positive values due to the large plasticity, and the dissipation potential 𝐷(𝜺̇𝑝, 𝜌̇𝑑is, 𝒒; 𝜀, 𝜌𝑑is, 𝜃) is convex, i.e., the associated Hessian matrix is semi-positive.

1055,1055,Compensating MTF measurements for chart quality limitations,"Objective measurements of imaging system sharpness (Modulation Transfer Function; MTF) are typically derived from test chart images. It is generally assumed that if testing recommendations are followed, test chart sharpness (which we also call “chart quality”) will have little impact on overall measurements. Standards such as ISO 12233 [1] ignore test chart sharpness. Situations where this assumption is not valid are becoming increasingly frequent, in part because extremely high-resolution cameras (over 30 megapixels) are becoming more common and in part because manufacturing test stations, which have limited space, often use charts that are smaller than optimum. Inconsistent MTF measurements caused by limited chart sharpness can be problematic in manufacturing supply chains that require consistency in measurements taken at different locations. We describe how to measure test chart sharpness, fit the measurement to a model, quantify the effects of chart sharpness on camera system MTF measurements, then compensate for these effects using deconvolution- by dividing measured system MTF by a model of the chart MTF projected on the image sensor. We use results of measurements with and without MTF compensation to develop a set of empirical guidelines to determine when chart quality is • good enough so that no compensation is needed, and • too low to be reliably compensated.",101407589,Imatest LLC,Boulder,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",29.857142857142858,0.11490800865800864,0.4675324675324676,1

1058,1058,Comparative analysis of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for online user content suicidal ideation detection,"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in most countries around the world; it is one of the three most common causes of death in a group of young people (15-24 years old), but so far no methods have been developed for diagnosing suicidal tendencies. In this connection, the problem of developing methods for identifying people prone to suicidal behavior is becoming especially topical. One of the directions of such research is the search for typological features of the speech related to suicide using the methods of mathematical linguistics, automatic text processing and machine learning. In foreign science, the texts of people that were motivated by suicide (mainly suicide notes) are studied using methods of automatic text processing (natural language processing), machine learning methods, and models that are constructed to allow to classify whether the text is related to suicide or not. It seems obvious that in order to develop methods for identifying people who are prone to suicide, it is necessary to analyze not only suicide notes (which are usually texts of small volume), but also other texts created by people who have committed suicide. The purpose of this work is to build a model of machine learning, apply teaching methods with and without a teacher, then select the most efficient algorithm for the task to classify whether the text is connected to suicide using comparative analysis. Our research contributes to detection of depressive content that can cause suicide, and to help such people reach confident help from psychologists of national suicide preventing center in Kazakhstan.

During the HIP process, components are produced by powders arrangement, deformation, and bound diffusion. However, the limitation of the HIP process is the nonuniform density distribution of the product, which should be eliminated by appropriate design of the process. In this study, the HIP process of a part of aircraft structure is numerically studied. An improved Shima model for the HIP is introduced to investigate the deformation and densification process of the component. Two schemes of the HIP process are designed and compared by analyzing the relative density distribution at the selected sections of the component.

1070,1070,A blind video watermarking technique for indoor video content protection using discrete wavelet transform,"In this paper, an highly effective algorithm for copyright protection is proposed using a simple and efficient embedding technique for DWT-based video watermarking for indoor video watermarking applications. The most frequently used transforms for video watermarking are Discrete Fourier Transform, Discrete Cosine Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform. The Discrete wavelet transform is more frequently use because of its excellent multi-resolution and spatial localization characteristics. Thus, looking at the specialties of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), in this project Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied on the video frame to achieve frequency domain representation of video sequences. The frequency domain representations of DWT are low pass and high pass components of which the low pass component is used to generate the key for each frame. In this way the generated key is used at the receiver for extracting the watermark which results in copyright protection. Blind watermarking technique is followed in this project, this needs only the key for extraction of hidden watermark. The advantage of this method is that it does not require the original video sequences for extraction. To scrutinize the robustness of the proposed algorithm, the original watermark image is equated with those of extracted watermark images by applying several attacks. The results are computed and the performance is evaluated based on the parameters, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Normalized Correlation Coefficient (NC) as well as Mean Square Error (MSE). The results illustrates that the process is a blind watermark technique and is highly robust against the different attacks.",60115567,Shri Vishnu Engineering College For Women,Bhimavaram,India,['1700'],21.416666666666668,0.10394927536231888,0.6039699792960662,1
1071,1071,Simulation speedup in omnet++ using contact traces," All rights reserved.The IoT influence is growing rapidly and it is expected that in the near future the number of connected IoT nodes will be in billions. Mobility of nodes is a key aspect in the IoT and network simulations are used to evaluate the performance of IoT networks with mobility. The increasing number of nodes will affect simulation environments by increasing the number of nodes per simulation and these simulations will require a long time to complete. So, techniques to reduce the time consumed in simulations are important. A possible technique is the use of contact traces when simulating mobility. A contact trace differs from a real trace or a synthetic mobility model in that, it deals with contact information instead of coordinate information. In this work, we have compared the performance of contact traces against coordinate based real traces and mobility models. For our evaluations we use the OPS framework of models built in OMNeT++. In the contact based approach, the use of real traces or mobility models will be removed and instead, nodes will use contact traces to obtain information about connections with other nodes. But this approach requires an additional step, before a simulation, to generate the contact traces. Even with this step, we show that using contact traces is advantageous in terms of simulation durations. When the scale of simulations increase (i.e., in terms of number of nodes, simulated times, etc.), the results presented show that the advantage increases considerably.",60008293,University of Bremen,Bremen,Germany,['1700'],20.5,0.07884615384615386,0.4961538461538461,0

The present paper reconsiders these results from a standard upgrading perspective. First, it theoretically investigates the way in which results obtained on semantically labeled scales can be “cleaned” from such an influence and derives the underlying computation formula for the mean opinion score. Secondly, it suggests a unitary evaluation procedure featuring both semantic free MOS computation and backward compatibility with respect to state-of-the-art solutions. The theoretical and methodological results are supported by subjective experiments corresponding to a total of 440 human observers, alternatively scoring 2D and stereoscopic video content. For each type of content, both high and low quality excerpts are alternatively considered.

This study was conducted to evaluate the utilization of blast furnace slag as an alternative to cement as an industrial by-product. Methods/Statistical analysis: In order to evaluate the use of blast furnace slag as an alternative to cement as an industrial by-product, this study replaced the blast furnace slag with 0, 20, 40, 60 (%) compared with cement and examined its characteristics. Findings: As the replacement rate of blast furnace slag increased, the density decreased and the fluidity tended to increase. Absorption and thermal conductivity are highly affected by density. As the substitution rate of blast furnace slag increased, the density decreased, and as a result, the water absorption tended to increase and the thermal conductivity tended to decrease. The overall compressive strength of the slag decreased with increasing blast furnace slag replacement rate at 7 days of age. In case of blast furnace slag replacement rate of 20 and 40 (%), the strength value was higher than that of OPC alone.

1081,1081,The effect of drought on allometric relationships of the leaf area and vegetative characteristics in two sensitive and tolerant white beans to vigna sinensis tension,"Growth and function of the root and aerial organ are closely related to each other. Due to the problems that exist regarding studying the root, there is less information about the characteristics of root than aerial organs. Through the allometric relationships between various components of the root, the effects the root and the aerial organ have on one another can be quantified and specified. This experiment was done in order to recognize the allometric relationships between the leaf area in different white bean cultivars. That is why an experiment was done using two different white bean cultivars, one was the tolerant KS41126 and the other was the blossoming white bean sensitive to deficit irrigation tension, in two different conditions including desirable irrigation and deficit irrigation tension in a farm as a factorial in the frame of randomized complete blocks with three repetitions in the replication year of 2012-2013 in the farm of Payam-e Noor University of Damghan. Sampling was done in three stages growth (stage of seedling, flowering and maturity) as an estimation and the characteristics of the leaf area, dry weight of vegetative parts (root, stem and leaf) and height of the plant, number of leaves and length of the longest root were measured. In order to describe the relationship of leaf area with the mentioned characteristics, power equation and linear equation were used. For various stages, the equation was fitted. The results showed that there wasn’t a significant difference between cultivars and kind of irrigation in terms of the coefficients of the equation. Therefore, an equation was able to justify the relationships between leaf area and other characteristics in the two cultivars in both kinds of irrigation. The determination coefficients for the relationship of leaf area in the plant with the number of leaves in the stem (R2=0.91), dry weight of green leaf (R2=0.93), height of the plant (R2=0.92) and dry weight of the root (R2=0.89) were significant which showed that there is a high correlation between them and the leaf area.

To acquire correct English pronunciation, suprasegmental features should be explained in detail.The collected data were analyzed using paired sample t-test, and the Cronbach’s alpha levels of the reliability coefficients were used. For the initial analysis of the data, the Cronbach’s alpha levels of the reliability were used in the survey. All of Cronbach’s alpha levels were over .80, indicating that each subscale met the recommended criteria. To compare the improvement of students’ listening ability focusing on suprasegmental features, pre and post-tests were done and the contents of the pre and post-tests were identical, but the order of items was randomized for each test.Before the experiment, a pre-test was conducted to measure the ability to study English. This test proves that there is no significant difference in basic listening abilities among subjects. However, there is significant difference in the area of stress as 7.08(***p<.001), and in the area of contract as 4.11(***p<.001). Also, significant differences were shown in the area of both linking and rhythm as 2.91(**p<.01).

1085,1085,Simulation of self-sustained relaxation of a two-dimensional metastable medium by means of a traveling wave," Published by Elsevier B.V.The traveling wave mode of self-sustained relaxation of a metastable medium, such as combustion and annealing of radiation-induced defects in solids, is studied. The mechanism of self-sustained relaxation and propagation of the traveling wave is a positive thermal-concentration feedback and heat transfer. The thermal-concentration feedback develops because the relaxation rate depends strongly on temperature, and the energy of the metastable state transforms into thermal energy in the process of relaxation. Hence, the relaxation leads to an increase in the medium temperature and, consequently, to further support of the relaxation. In this work, traveling waves are considered, and their features are investigated by computer simulation. The shape and speed of the traveling wave are investigated as a function of the medium properties, and the way of its initiation. We examined the shapes of wavefronts as they propagate on a plane, and observed two different regimes of traveling wave propagation. Sometimes the front of the traveling wave spreads as a whole and velocity of propagation is perpendicular to the wavefront. Sometimes small perturbations arise on the wavefront, and then grow by virtue of relaxation along the front, thus, the new area of the relaxed medium has the form of a narrow strip that propagates along the line of the front and maintains a constant width in the direction perpendicular to the front. We observe the appearance of one or more small perturbations, which arise in a symmetric way. The influence of boundaries on the traveling waves was also investigated.",60021902,Universiteit van Pretoria,Pretoria,South Africa,['1702'],22.818181818181817,0.06641414141414141,0.48055555555555557,0

In this study, we investigate the relationship between faithfulness and preference of a star field in a planetarium through a psychometric experiment with 47 observers. The experimental procedure followed the previous study. The rating of faithfulness improved for the projection pattern with a smaller star size. For the preference evaluation, the projection pattern with low luminance significantly lowered the preference rating. The results of the experiment indicate that the preferable star reproduction was different between male and female observers, whereas the faithful star reproduction was not significantly different in the evaluations between male and female observers.

The most important characteristic features of the HSTP category remain as in the previous edition [MST+18]: i) The flexibility of programming languages as structuring principles for hybrid systems, ii) The unambiguity and precision of program semantics, and iii) The mathematical rigor of logical reasoning principles. The HSTP category especially features many nonlinear and parametric continuous and hybrid systems. Owing to the nature of theorem proving, HSTP again accommodates three modes: A) Automatic in which the entire verification is performed fully automatically without any additional input beyond the original hybrid system and its safety specification. H) Hints in which select proof hints are provided as part of the input problem specification, allowing users to communicate specific advice about the system such as loop invariants. S) Scripted in which a significant part of the verification is done with dedicated proof scripts or problem-specific proof tactics. This threefold split makes it possible to better identify the sources of scalability and efficiency bottlenecks in hybrid systems theorem proving. The existence of all three categories also makes it easier for new tools with a different focus to participate in the competition, wherever they focus on in the spectrum from fast proof checking all the way to full automation.

A clustering method that is robust to noise is highly desirable. No one clustering method performs best across all data sets despite a vast number of methods available. Cluster ensemble provides an approach to automatically combine results from multiple clustering methods for improving robustness and accuracy. We have proposed a novel noise robust fuzzy cluster ensemble algorithm. It employs an improved fuzzy clustering approach with different initializations as its base clusterings to avoid or alleviate the effects of noise in data sets. Its results show effective improvements over most examined noisy real cancer gene expression data sets when compared with most evaluated benchmark clustering methods: it is the top performer on three of the eight data sets, more than any other methods evaluated, and it performs well on most of the other data sets.

1112,1112,Recurrent and non-recurrent congestion based gridlock detection on chula-sss urban road network," All rights reserved.Traffic congestion on not only highways but also complex urban road networks has attracted the attention of many researchers. Traffic congestion growing in urban road networks is an inevitably important problem especially for populated cities during rush hours. A traffic blockage can be realized as the source of traffic congestion, which can propagate to form queues and sometimes a gridlock. Traffic blockages are triggered by complicated factors ranging from temporal and spatial situations. Recurrent congestion is a traffic congestion that occurs during morning and evening rush hours e.g. from school buses and parent vehicles to drive their children to-and-from schools. In addition, unforeseen, unexpected events that can cause as non-recurrent traffic congestion e.g. car breakdowns, accidents, road maintenance, and severe weather conditions, which can disorder normal traffic flows and reduce road capacity. Traffic blockage may spread its negative impacts to neighbouring upstream and downstream links. And that can lead to the formation of congestion gridlock, which further reduce traffic flow efficiency in a complex urban road network. These problems are vital but often tough to resolve in urban road networks. In this paper, the Chula-Sathorn SUMO Simulator (Chula-SSS) dataset has been used with Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) to simulate recurrent and non-recurrent congestion cases. The detection is based on the information from simulated lane area detectors. For non-recurrent case, lanes are closed to simulate the gridlock occurrences. With the morning case of calibrated Chula-SSS dataset, both recurrent and nonrecurrent congestion based gridlock have been studied with upstream and downstream nearby detectors and preliminary results are herein reported upon the gridlock status as detected by using different combinations of traffic jam length and mean speed conditions at both the upstream and downstream detectors of every intersection within the critical looped road segments.",60028190,Chulalongkorn University,Bangkok,Thailand,['1700'],19.666666666666668,-0.04324494949494949,0.5123106060606062,0

1120,1120,The effect of finite element type on the results of superplastic forming simulation, Published by Elsevier B.V.Superplastic Forming is an industrial process to produce thin-walled products of complex shape. At the same time this process allows one to obtain the products with close to uniform thickness distribution. The process exploits the abilities of some polycrystalline materials to large elongations before failure. The best formability can be achieved only under very specific conditions of temperature and strain rate. In order to calculate the pressure regime to sustain target strain rate in critical arias it is necessary to use finite element simulation. The pressure regime calculation lasts for a day's especially while 3 dimensional elements are use. To reduce the time of calculation it is possible to use elements from membrane theory. The main idea of this approach is to use planar elements instead of tetrahedronal for 3D tasks or 2 nodes elements instead of triangular ones for axisymmetric tasks. This reduction doesn't take in account share stress accruing into material. The main aim of this paper is to study the effect of elements type on the accuracy of thickness distribution prognosis.,60020513,National Research University Higher School of Economics,Moscow,Russian Federation,['1702'],17.8,0.07161172161172161,0.552518315018315,0
1121,1121,Research for developing english learning contents based on user’s native language,"Background/Objectives: The development of information and communication technology, the necessity of the common language for the infinite information exchange of this era is considered as important, and one of the representative languages currently playing such role is English. Methods/Statistical analysis: The proposed system analyzes the vocabulary and written contexts frequently used by the user by collecting the verbal and written text information of the native language which is usually used in the environment such as daily life, work situation or learning situation, and judge suitability through comparison analysis with existing English learning contents so that it can be used as text of English learning contents optimized for learners. Findings: There are various people learning foreign languages/English that can serve as a lingua franca all over the world. Many of them are non-native speakers and suffer from many difficulties in learning the target language. As a result, various learning methods related to English or foreign language learning have been studied, and new ways of applying new technologies have been diversified in order to make the learners effort more beneficial. Recently, mobile learning using IT devices is actively being used in English learning methods. Since applying mobile learning can offset many of the disadvantaging factors in foreign language learning. In this study, we focused on seeking a way to develop a system to convert learning information of native language into English learning contents utilizing IT devices. The majority of English textbooks and digital contents are based on the author’s knowledge of social and cultural backgrounds, focusing on those who speak English as their native language. However, learners often have an established identity with their social and cultural background knowledge, and the difficulty of acquiring new background knowledge in order to learn a new language makes language learning more difficult. There are a lot of negative opinions about the effectiveness of the English learning materials and contents, and it is convincing that the learning of the target language is more effective by utilizing the English learning materials based on the learners' native language. Improvements/Applications: The language of learners who learn English is very diverse, and there are many variables in applying their native language for making beneficial learning content of the target language because the structural characteristics of the language and the socio-cultural background are different. Thus, there is a need to find ways to accurately identify and eliminate these variables.",60031231,Semyung University,Jecheon,South Korea,['1700'],30.615384615384617,0.09307575757575759,0.3291969696969697,1

Error diffusion (ED) is an algorithm that has proven to be effective for the halftoning process, and it has been widely applied to digital printing tasks. However, in images reproduced by conventional ED algorithms based on signal processing theory, the total appearance of objects-which includes properties such as glossiness, transparency, and roughness-is often lost. In this paper, we propose an appearance-preserving ED algorithm to improve the quality of printed images. We consider a texture-preserving approach to effectively represent the total appearance of objects. In this study, we utilized different weights for the error distribution based on the texture strength to permit stable representation of the pixels relevant to the texture.

1126,1126,3D tone-dependent fast error diffusion,"As 3D printing becomes more prevalent, more attention is being paid to its ability to adequately reproduce the appearance of surfaces. Research into methods to accurately represent grayscale images through halftoning is well-developed in 2D printing, but work in the halftoning of surfaces in 3D printing is less developed. The halftoning method of tone-dependent fast error diffusion has been shown in 2D printing to be an effective means of achieving both high image quality and computational efficiency, making it an ideal algorithm to run in printing units where computational power is restricted. This work seeks to adapt tone-dependent fast error diffusion to halftone the surfaces of three-dimensional objects. Here, the ideal tone-dependent error diffusion parameters will be calculated for an image. Then, a surface traversal mechanism will be implemented to navigate the surface of a three-dimensional object while error diffusion is applied to halftone it. The expected result is an algorithm that can halftone the surface of an object with quality approaching that of iterative methods, with a fraction of the processing that they require. Iterative methods currently produce the highest halftoning quality for 3D surfaces, but their use is limited due to the amount of computation they entail. The development of a tone-dependent fast error diffusion algorithm allows 3D halftoning to represent a continuous-tone surface with comparably high quality, but the computation it requires is more appropriate for standard printers; thus, it improves on the quality of surface halftoning that most printing units can produce.",60009254,Purdue University,West Lafayette,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",27.333333333333332,0.26914078674948244,0.4709213250517599,1

Based on the interaction of the pulsed magnetic field and metallic melt, for example, the as-cast grain size of alloys can be refined to about 50-100 um. The numerical simulation and experimental results show that the pulsed magnetic field causes melt vibration and but melt convection during the solidification of magnesium alloys.

1128,1128,A study on the regional competitiveness of hawaii,"Background/Objectives: Hawaii's economy is growing at a high rate, while its unemployment rate is falling. This study elaborately analyzes Hawaii's current regional competitiveness and makes suggestions to improve it further. Methods/Statistical Analysis: This study analyzed the regional competitiveness of Hawaii in four areas. First, Corporation competitiveness increases profitability by developing superior products and business models. Second, Industry competitiveness is the ability to establish the framework to be a knowledge-based industry. Third, Site conditions refer to the material and cultural situations, including infrastructure, educational institutions, and industrial complexes. Lastly, Policies include investment incentives and subsidies provided by local governments. Findings: From a corporation competitiveness perspective, Hawaii has a high proportion of small businesses. In terms of industry, the federal government's military spending and tourism are the key sectors that lead the economy, while other industries are weak. In terms of site conditions, there are abundant natural tourism resources, such as the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Lanikai Beach, and the Diamond Head State Monument. Hawaii's overall education level is not as bad as the national average. However, it is hard to find excellent research institutes and notable higher education institutions. From a regional policy perspective, the Hawaiian government has introduced the concept of targeted industry portfolio to assess the level of new growth engines each year since 2009.Nevertheless, the target industry sector selected as a new growth engine has not been successful in the region yet.

1129,1129,The microstructure and mechanical property of high niobium TiAl alloy prepared by electromagnetic cold crucible," Published by Elsevier B.V.With the development of aerospace industry, higher requirements are placed on the performance of high temperature structural materials. TiAl alloy, which has low density, high specific strength and specific modulus, good oxidation resistance and creep resistance, has a potential to be widely used in the future. Especially the high niobium TiAl alloys that has been developed in recent years will have more broad application than ordinary TiAl alloys because of higher operating temperature and greater oxidation resistance. In this paper, high niobium TiAl alloys are prepared by electromagnetic cold crucible (EMCC) multifunctional continuous casting technique. The microstructure, element distribution, room-temperature tensile property and high-temperature tensile property of as-cast and the alloy prepared by EMCC are investigated, respectively. The microstructure of high niobium TiAl-based alloys mainly consists of (a2+?)lamellae, B2 and blocky ? phase. The concentration of Nb in the B2 phase is higher than in the other two phases. Appreciable room-temperature tensile properties, including an ultimate tensile strength of 622 MPa compared with 450 MPa in as-cast condition, were achieved at optimal solidification parameters. As the test temperature increases, the ultimate tensile strength of the alloy has a tendency to increase first at 700ºC and then decrease, which is related to dislocation motion and slip characteristics of intermetallic compound. The results show that the alloy prepared by EMCC has more uniform microstructure, less segregation and great improvement in mechanical properties.",60019616,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China,['1702'],23.4,0.11780303030303031,0.4877525252525252,0
1130,1130,RNN-based distance estimation using UWB signaling,"Background/Objectives: The objective of this paper is to develop a new distance estimation method for indoor localization by using ultra-wideband (UWB) signals.The new technique is based on recurrent neural network (RNN), one of the famous deep learning techniques. Methods/Statistical analysis: RNN is one of the most suitable methods for learning time series data. Hence, it is useful in processing data that change with time. The proposed method estimates the distance based on RNN from the received UWB signals. Specifically, from the received signals via IEEE802.15.4a indoor channels, the proposed RNN regressor estimates the distance. The proposed method is validated by computer simulation. Findings: In order to estimate the distance using UWB signals, it is necessary to accurately detect the first arrived signal along the shortest path.To find this signal or time instance by using RNN, we convert 1-dimensional received signal into 2-dimensional signal. The converted signal is input to RNN regressor and trained so that the RNN output is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. The conventional method needs received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)estimation, and the threshold is determined by the estimated SNR. When the received signal exceeds the threshold, the first arrived signal is detected and the arrived time is called the time of arrival (ToA). However, the proposed method estimates the distance directly from the received signal without SNR estimation.According to the simulation results, the proposed method shows RMSE of less than 2 [m] in low SNR, and less than 0.5 [m] in high SNR.Those performancesare much better than the conventional method. Improvements/Applications: The performance of the proposed RNN based distance estimator is examinedthrough computer simulation. To compare estimation accuracy, the root mean square error (RMSE) is measured. According to the results, the proposed estimator is superior to the conventional method.",60068689,Hanbat National University,Yusong,South Korea,['1700'],21.0,0.14818793525315266,0.4561457745153397,1
1131,1131,SBM simulation of pet bottles using newtonian fluid method in ansys polyflow,"Background/Objectives: The rational assumption of the viscosity of the preform, which is difficult to obtain an accurate value, and the simulation using a Newtonian fluid model rather than a visco-elasto-plasticity, make it easy to check the molding behavior of PET bottles in the field. Methods/Statistical analysis: Except for the viscosity coefficient, the variables are configured as if they were actual. Viscosity coefficients are performed at 50,000 intervals from 50,000 cps to 250,000 cps. At this time, SBM is divided into stretch and blowing phases, and each process operates in order of 0.1 second. The lateral thickness of the bottle obtained by this simulation is compared with the distribution of the lateral thickness of the actual bottle. Findings: In the SBM process, the viscosity of the preform was confirmed to be less than 50,000 cps. In addition, when focusing on the lateral thickness of the bottle, the thickness distribution of the simulation and the actual thickness distribution of the bottle does not show a big difference. Therefore, the simulation using the Newtonian fluid method used in this study is expected to be suitable for field application. As the computing power evolves, more simulations can be performed in a shorter time, so it is expected that a variety of variables can be set in the field to understand molding behavior. Improvements/Applications: By simulating the viscosity coefficients of the preforms in the field, it is possible to find suitable assumptions and to perform simulations in the production of other shaped products.",60017818,Kyonggi University,Suwon,South Korea,['1700'],24.8,0.09692982456140352,0.437280701754386,1

This effect induces a problem of residual strength estimation of structure after impact, which is especially apparent on compression after impact (CAI) test. Simulation assumes an application of damage initiation criterion and damage evolution model susceptible to the different complex failure modes. It requires a comprehensive understanding of numerous failure mechanisms in composite materials and execution of complex mechanical tests for obtaining of advanced mechanical characteristics. Presented work proposes an innovative approach for residual strength estimation of composite plate after impact based on topology optimization algorithm for finding of the “worst-case” damage distribution.

1137,1137,Vertical data processing for mining big data: A predicate tree approach," All rights reserved.Time is a critical factor in processing a very large volume of data a.k.a ‘Big Data’. Many existing data mining algorithms (supervised and unsupervised) become futile because of the ubiquitous use of horizontal processing i.e. row-by-row processing of stored data. Processing time for big data is further exacerbated by its high dimensionality (# of features) and high cardinality (# of records). To address this processing-time issue, we proposed a vertical approach with predicate trees (pTree). Our approach structures data into columns of bit slices, which range from few to hundreds and are processed vertically i.e. column by column. We tested and compared our vertical approach to traditional (horizontal) approach using three basic Boolean operations namely addition, subtraction and multiplication with 10 data sizes. The length of data size ranged from half a billion bits to 5 billion bits. The results are analyzed w.r.t processing speed time and speed gain for both the approaches. The result shows that our vertical approach outperformed the traditional approach for all Boolean operations (add, subtract and multiply) across all data sizes and results in speed-gain between 24% to 96%. We concluded from our results that our approach being in data-mining ready format is best suited to apply to operations involving complex computations in big data application to achieve significant speed gain.",60017152,St. Cloud State University,St Cloud,United States,['1700'],18.25,0.10562656641604011,0.4054636591478697,0

Methods/Statistical analysis: The analysis period was using total 213 monthly data from January 2000 to September 2017. As a analysis result, there is a harmonization phenomenon between China's export to world and Korea's export to China and showed a very high correlation. Findings: The correlation coefficient between China's exports to the world and Korea's exports to China by year was calculated as 0.9055. The correlation is showing very high harmonization phenomenon. In a regression analysis in which Korea's exports to China are dependent variables, the coefficient of China's exports to the world was 0.3040. We can recognize that KOEX increases by one unit when CNEX increases by 0.3040. In CNEX included with KOEX, CNEX and KOEX are interpreted as moving without time lag. As of 2016, Korea's exports to China account for 25.11%(1st) of total exports, but China's exports to Korea account for 4.48%(4th). It is also confirmed that China's exports to world and Korea's exports to China show high mutual harmonization phenomenon. In the Korean economy, China accounts for a large portion of exports and trade balance. Therefore, it is expected to be influenced greatly by the economic trend of China in the future.

However, CMMI is somewhat inadequate to address security issues in the area of privacy. Methods/Statistical analysis: This study aims to investigate the process at each level of CMMI and management and technical protection measures of personal information protection in Korea.In particular, the administrative, management and technical requirements for privacy in Korea are very similar to ISO27001.That especially includes establishment and implementation of internal management plan, Access control, Encryption of personal information. Through these studies, we found protective measures to maximize effectiveness. Findings: In this study, we found some privacy measures applicable to CMMI. First, we proposed an overall security policy by establishing an internal security management system, and proposed to operate CISO positions independently for effective personal information protection activities. Through this, it can contribute to strengthening personal information protection capability, preventing cyber infringement, and minimizing damage in case of an accident. Second, the DMZ, server area, and DB area were divided to protect internal personal information from the outside for network access control. In addition, in order to block the exposure of internal IP address from outside, NAT (Network Address Translate) is used to isolate inside and outside. In particular, the introduction of private IP can fundamentally block access from the outside. Finally, to protect your privacy, we proposed an encryption algorithm. This minimizes the damage caused by illegal hacking and the leakage of personal information.

1149,1149,Virtual and physical simulation forming of flat workpieces under upsetting," Published by Elsevier B.V.The influence of friction on the forming of flat workpiece with upsetting is investigated using the software complex Deform-3D during a virtual experiment. The following is shown: when the friction is great (i.e., the friction coefficient is greater than 0.5), forming takes place in accordance with the principle of least perimeter, confirmed in experiments on the upsetting of steel samples by Carl von Zobbe at the beginning of the last century. If the friction is close to zero, which is extremely rare in industrial conditions, rectangular samples during upsetting, increasing in size, retain their shape. Then we can highlight two kinematic schemes of metal flow. With minimal friction, a radial scheme of metal flow is observed, with great friction - a normal scheme of metal flow, which corresponds to the principle of least perimeter. In real deformation processes, when the friction is far from zero, any shape of the cross-section of the workpiece should tend to the circle. This statement is considered a classic axiom, although no one confirmed experimentally. All researchers confined to the study of the forming of workpieces of rectangular cross-section. We conducted laboratory experiments on the upsetting of plasticine samples of arbitrary shape. It has been established, that for any shape of the cross-section of a flat sample the principle of least perimeter is confirmed, i.e., with great degrees of deformation the cross-section of the workpiece turns into a circle.",60025383,Southern Federal University,Rostov-on-Don,Russian Federation,['1702'],23.8,0.15942028985507248,0.5384057971014493,0

Hot deformation behavior of the steels was examined with a constant strain rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 1/s between 1150 ºC and 900 ºC. The effects of deformation strain rate (0.001~1 1/s) and temperature on compression behavior of the steels was studied. It shows that the deformation conditions have significant influence on stress-strain curves of the steel. The curve shows obvious dynamic recrystallization style at high temperature, and low strain rate or dynamic recovery or work-hardening style at low temperature and high strain rate. The deformation resistance decreases with deformation temperature increasing and strain rate decreasing, and the peak stress and peak strain both decrease, which demonstrates that dynamic recrystallization is more easily to occur at high deformation temperature and low strain rate. The austenite hot deformation equation was established as following.

1154,1154,The effect of strain rate under multiple forging on the mechanical and microstructural properties," Published by Elsevier B.V.The flow stress of aluminum alloy 6082M under cyclic, non-monotonic plastic deformation has been determined by multiaxial forging experiments, using the MaxStrain system on a Gleeble 3800 thermo-physical simulator. The simulations were done at ambient temperature with different strain rates of 0.1, 1.0 and 10 1/s. The plastic strain amplitude per forging pass was 0.4. The accumulated equivalent strain was around 4 in each forging simulation. For the mechanical modeling of the cyclic, non-monotonic plastic deformation characteristic of the forming process, a control program and measurement arrangements have been developed. These controlled the equivalent logarithmic strain and the equivalent strain rate implemented in each forming step. It was also suitable for measuring the dimensions of the deformed material volume between the tools. These parameters and the measured force data were applied in the mechanical model, based on the principle of virtual velocities. In parallel with the cyclic experiments, monotonic plane-strain Watts-Ford compression tests were also performed. Strain rate influence for material properties has been investigated. Monotonous and cyclic flow curves were compared, and significant differences were found. Contrary to the monotonous flow curve, the cyclic flow stress showed the Bauschinger effect, occurring when the load direction was changed. Concerning the effect of strain rate it can be concluded that the applied strain rate influences the strain hardening, the resultant hardness and the characteristic properties of the generated ultrafine-grained microstructure.",60030035,Budapest University of Technology and Economics,Budapest,Hungary,['1702'],17.923076923076923,0.1273809523809524,0.49404761904761907,0

Manual measurement of plant phenotypes, such as height is inefficient, labor intensive and error prone. We present a robust, LiDAR based approach to estimate the height of biomass sorghum plants. A vertically oriented laser rangefinder onboard an agricultural robot captures LiDAR scans of the environment as the robot traverses between crop rows. These LiDAR scans are used to generate height contours for a single row of plants corresponding to a given genetic strain. We apply ground segmentation, iterative peak detection and peak filtering to estimate the average height of each row. Our LiDAR based approach is capable of estimating height at all stages of the growing period, from emergence e.g. 10 cm through canopy closure e.g. 4 m. Our algorithm has been extensively validated by several ground truthing campaigns on biomass sorghum. These measurements encompass typical methods employed by breeders as well as higher accuracy methods of measurement.

1164,1164,Element balance formulation in reactive compositional flow and transport with parameterization technique,"We present a novel nonlinear formulation for modeling reactive-compositional flow and transport in the presence of complex phase behavior due to a combination of thermodynamic and chemical equilibria in multi-phase systems. We apply this formulation to model precipitation/dissolution of minerals in reactive multiphase flow in subsurface reservoirs. The proposed formulation is based on the consistent element balance reduction of the molar (overall composition) formulation. To predict the complex phase behavior in such systems, we include the chemical equilibrium constraints to the multiphase multicomponent negative flash calculations and solve the thermodynamic phase and chemical phase equilibria simultaneously. In this solution, the phase equilibrium is represented by the partition coefficients, whereas the chemical equilibrium reaction is represented by the activity coefficients model. This provides a generic treatment of chemical and thermodynamic equilibrium within the successive substitution loop of mulmultiphase flash to accommodate chemical equilibrium reactions (precipitation and dissolution reactions). Equilibrium Rate Annihilation matrix allows us to reduce the governing component conservation equations to element conservation equations, while the coupling between chemical and thermodynamic equilibrium is captured by a simultaneous solution of modified multiphase flash equations. The element balance equation written in terms of overall component mole fractions is modified and defined in terms of element mole fractions. Therefore, the primary set of governing equations are the element balance equations and the kinetic equations. This element composition of the mixture serves as an input to the modified multiphase flash computations, whereas the output is fractions of components in each phase, including solids. The nonlinear element–based governing equations are solved with the modified version of the operator-based linearization (OBL) approach where the governing equations are formulated in terms of space- and state-dependent parameters constrained by the solution of the extended multiphase flash. The element balance molar formulation along with the modified multiphase flash has been tested in a simple transport model with dissolution and precipitation reactions. The simulation of multidimensional problems of practical interest has been performed using the adaptive OBL technique. This is the first time when a robust multiphase multicomponent flash based on element fractions is coupled with an element balance–based compositional formulation and tested for multidimensional problems of practical interest. The proposed technique improves both robustness and performance of complex chemical models.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,"['1706', '1703']",24.733333333333334,-0.03035714285714285,0.27967687074829933,1

Strossmayer University of Osijek , Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology. All rights reserved.This paper provides a systematic comparative study of position tracking control of nonlinear robotic manipulators. The main contribution of this study is a comprehensive numerical simulation assessing position tracking performances and energy consumption of integral sliding mode control (ISMC), a linear-quadratic regulator with integral action (LQRT), and optimal integral sliding mode control (OISMC) under three conditions; namely, Case I) without the coupling effect, Case II) with the coupling effect on Link 1 only, and Case III) with the coupling effect on Link 2 only. The viability of the concept is evaluated based on three performance criteria, i.e., the step-response characteristics, position tracking error, and energy consumption of the aforementioned controllers. Based upon the simulation study, it has been found that OISMC offers performances almost similar to ISMC with more than 90% improvement of tracking performance under several cases compared to LQRT; however, energy consumption is successfully reduced by 3.6% in comparison to ISMC. Energy consumption of OISMC can be further reduced by applying optimization algorithms in tuning the weighting matrices. This paper can be considered significant as a robotic system with high tracking accuracy and low energy consumption is highly demanded to be implemented in smart factories, especially for autonomous systems.",60025577,Universiti Putra Malaysia,Serdang,Malaysia,"['1708', '1705']",27.25,0.13629761904761903,0.4890595238095238,1
1166,1166,Subjective evaluations on perceptual image brightness in high dynamic range television,"Viewers of high dynamic range television (HDR, HDR-TV) expect a comfortable viewing experience with significantly brighter highlights and improved details of darker areas on a brighter display. However, extremely bright images on a HDR display are potentially undesirable and lead to an uncomfortable viewing experience. To avoid the issues, we require specific production guidelines for subjective brightness to ensure brightness consistency between and within programs. To create such production guidelines, it is necessary to develop an objective metric for subjective brightness in HDR-TVs. A previous study reports that the subjective brightness is proportional to the average of displayed pixel luminance levels. However, other parameters can affect the subjective brightness. Therefore, we conducted a subjective evaluation test by using specific test images to identify the factors that affect the perceived overall brightness of HDR images. Our results indicated that positions and distributions of displayed pixel luminance levels on video affect brightness in addition to the average of displayed pixel luminance levels. The study is expected to contribute to the development of an objective metric for subjective brightness.",60103907,Nippon Hoso Kyokai,Tokyo,Japan,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",19.555555555555557,0.023333333333333345,0.4670175438596491,1

IoT refers to a system of interrelated users and objects that are interconnected and have a significant impact on our lives. However, one of the most important challenges facing the ubiquitous adoption of IoT technology is security. In this regard, key distribution refers to the core process of setting up secure connection through a communication channel. This paper surveys the status of research until 2019 related to key distribution schemes in the context of IoT. Moreover, the classification of a key distribution is presented. In this study, we have conducted comparisons between different key distribution schemes in terms of memory storage, communication costs, and computation costs. Additionally, we propose a new taxonomy of symmetric key distribution while proposing a hybrid hierarchical architecture for the key distribution in the context of fog computing.

1171,1171,Learning face perception without vision: Rebound learning effect and hemispheric differences in congenital vs late-onset blindness," This Cognitive-Kinesthetic Drawing approach previously developed by Likova (e.g., 2010, 2012, 2013) enabled us to rapidly train and study training-driven neuroplasticity in both the blind and sighted groups. The five-day two-hour training taught participants to haptically explore, recognize, memorize raised-line images, and draw them free-hand from memory, in detail, including the fine facial characteristics of the face stimuli. Such drawings represent an externalization of the formed memory. Functional MRI was run before and after the training. Tactile-face perception activated the occipito-temporal cortex in all groups. However, the training led to a strong, predominantly left-hemispheric reorganization in the two blind groups, in contrast to right-hemispheric in blindfolded-sighted, i.e., the post-training response-change was stronger in the left hemisphere in the blind, but in the right in the blindfolded. This is the first study to discover interhemispheric differences in non-visual face processing. Remarkably, for face perception this learning-based change was positive in the CB and BF groups, but negative in the LB-group. Both the lateralization and inversed-sign learning effects were specific to face perception, but absent for the control nonface categories of small objects and houses. The unexpected inversed-sign training effect in CB vs LB suggests different stages of brain plasticity in the ventral pathway specific to the face category. Importantly, the fact that only after a very few days of our training, the totally-blind-from-birth CB manifested a very good (haptic) face perception, and even developed strong empathy to the explored faces, implies a preexisting face schema that can be “unmasked” and “tuned up” by a proper learning procedure. The Likova Cognitive-Kinesthetic Training is a powerful tool for driving brain plasticity, and providing deeper insights into non-visual learning, including emergence of perceptual categories. A rebound learning model and a neuroBayesian economy principle are proposed to explain the multidimensional learning effects. The results provide new insights into the Nature-vs-Nurture interplay in rapid brain plasticity and neurorehabilitation.",60020968,Smith Kettlewell Eye Research Institute,San Francisco,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",22.357142857142858,0.0904529993815708,0.5123469387755102,0
1172,1172,Modelling and design of new stainless-steel welding alloys suitable for low-deformation repairs and restoration processes," Published by Elsevier B.V.The plasticity associated with low-temperature martensitic transformation can be exploited to reduce the stresses developed due to thermal contraction of the weldments. The key feature of stress-mitigating welding alloys is their transformation from austenite to martensite at low temperatures e.g. ideally close to ambient temperature. Thermodynamics databases (MTDATA and SGTE) were used to model and design new welding alloys with low martensitic transformation temperatures (Ms) around 200 °C. The modelling, conducted in this work, was based on this assumption that martensitic transformation starts at a certain temperature when the free-energy change for austenite to transform to ferrite reaches a critical value. Since martensitic transformation is a diffusion-less process, the change in free-energy vs. temperature was calculated for the austenite and ferrite phases with the same composition. Three prototype welding alloys, CamAlloys 4 & 5 and OpenAlloy 1, were successfully designed and made in the University of Cambridge (UK) and the Open University (UK). The design of these alloys was purely based on thermodynamics equations. Comprehensive characterisation, examinations and mechanical tests showed this family of alloys could substantially reduce contraction-induced deformations in stainless steel weldments. One of the applications of these alloys is in the repair and restoration of damaged stainless-steel components.",60031101,University of Cambridge,Cambridge,United Kingdom,['1702'],18.636363636363637,0.17070964749536177,0.5268552875695732,0
1173,1173,On architectural decay prediction in real-time software systems," All rights reserved.As the number of software applications including the widespread of real-time and embedded systems are constantly increasing and tend to grow in complexity, the architecture tends to decay over the years, leading to the occurrence of a spectrum of defects and bad smells (i.e., instances of architectural decay) that are manifested and sustained over time in a software system’s life cycle. Thus, the implemented system is not compliant to the specified architecture and such architectural decay becomes an increasing challenge for the developers. We propose a set of constructive architecture views at different levels of granularity, which monitor and ensure that the modifications made by developers at the implementation level are in compliance with those of the different architectural timed-event elements of real-time systems. Thus, we investigated a set of orthogonal architectural decay paradigms timed-event component decay, timed-event interface decay, timed-event connector decay and timed-event port decay. All of this has led to predicting, forecasting, and detecting architectural decay with a greater degree of structure, abstraction techniques, architecture reconstruction; and hence offered a series of potential effectiveness and enhancement in gaining a deeper understanding of implementation-level bad smells in real-time systems. Furthermore, to support this research towards an effective architectural decay prediction and detection geared towards real-time and embedded systems, we investigated and evaluated the effect of our approach through a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) case study.",60027252,Northwest Missouri State University,Maryville,United States,['1700'],38.5,-0.0333333333333333,0.6296296296296297,0
1174,1174,Low-dimensional estimation and prediction framework for description of the oscillatory traffic dynamics," All rights reserved.Large majority of control methodologies used in traffic applications require short-time prediction of the environment. For instance, in widely-used Model Predictive Control [1] employed to reduce fuel and energy consumption of vehicles in a platoon, information about future velocity profiles of leading vehicles is necessary. In such case, the dynamic model should provide information more detailed than prediction of averaged and global quantities. Additionally, if the control input is to be applied at high-frequencies, traffic model must be solved in a short period of time. We propose a novel framework which addresses aforementioned problems by estimating the vehicle velocity at any location in the domain based on the real-time information from induction loops downstream. Additionally, our formulation is linear and low-dimensional (i.e. consists of few degrees of freedom) meaning that the estimation can be executed at high frequencies. First a mapping is constructed from velocities at discrete locations to the smooth continuous field, which is subsequently projected onto its most significant principal components. Next, current state of such system is estimated using Kalman filter by combining the linear, wave-like dynamics of the traffic with the instantaneous information provided by induction loops. Short-term traffic prediction is then achieved by integration of the model forward in time. The proxy methodology is validated using SUMO simulation on the test case of the vehicles approaching a traffic junction. The performance is evaluated based on sampling reconstructed continuous waveform at the locations and timestamps of the vehicles in the reference data and calculating velocity errors. Separate cases are considered where drivers follow Intelligent Driver Model perfectly and with varying levels of uncertainty.",60025225,University of Southampton,Southampton,United Kingdom,['1700'],20.76923076923077,0.19022727272727272,0.41090909090909095,0

The paper provides an extension for the existing standardized short-term video quality model mode 0 for new codecs i.e., H.265, VP9 and AV1 and resolutions larger than full-HD (e.g. UHD-1). The extension is based on two subjective video quality tests. In the tests, in total 13 different source contents of 10 seconds each were used. These sources were encoded with resolutions ranging from 360p to 2160p and various quality levels using the H.265, VP9 and AV1 codecs. The subjective results from the two tests were then used to derive a mapping/correction function for P.1203.1 to handle new codecs and resolutions.

However, even though various classification method has been proposed, the detection of malware behavior remains a challenging task as the detection method focusing more on traffic data classification. Consequently, there is a lack of classification approach employed to classify Windows Registry data for malware detection.

The cylinder specimen of magnesium rare earth alloy could reach the three-dimensional compressive stress state by canning compression test. Firstly, the equivalent plastic strain and stress triaxiality, that the magnesium rare earth alloy could reach by compression test at 350 °C without canning or with canning on different materials, were compared. The simulation results showed that the equivalent plastic strain could reach 2.5 and the stress triaxiality was more than -7. Then high stress cladding material was chosen to use in the experiments. Canning compression tests at different temperatures (350 ° C, 400 ° C, 450 ° C) and different strain rates (0.01 s-1, 0.1 s-1) were conducted.

A set of colour pairs applied to food colourings was rated on a 1-10 scale of harmony, in two different locations, Norway and Taiwan. The results indicate that the harmoniousness of the colour pairs was rated slightly lower by the colour-deficient observers, but that other factors - the type of food object and the different nationalities of the observers - had a greater effect. It was also found that the results of showing deuteranope simulations of the colour pairs to normal observers did not agree with judgements made by those observers with an actual colour vision deficiency.",60013141,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",30.25,0.06354166666666666,0.4552083333333333,0
1188,1188,A low-cost hardware trojan mitigation method for securing untrusted thirdparty cryptographic intellectual property cores,"Background/Objectives: This paperproposes a methodfor curtailing the effects of hardware Trojans in cryptographic third-party intellectual property (3PIP) cores without having access to the internal circuitry of the cores. Methods/Statistical analysis: The proposed method obscures inputs to the 3PIP core and detects suspicious outputs thereby preventing the leakage of sensitive information. The proposed hardware architecture consists of XOR gates, multiplexers, and comparators. The hardware architecture was designed using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) and was synthesized using a Virtex4 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. The synthesis was done using Xilinx ISE 14.7 Software which includes ISIM for simulation. Findings: The time-to-market of an electronic product is diminishing due to the competitive nature of the hardware design space. To help cope with the short time-to-market, hardware manufacturing companies tend to integrate 3PIP cores in their designs. The recent surge of hardware Trojans in 3PIP cores make it extremely dangerous to integrate them in designs without thorough evaluation and testing. This is particularly harmful when Trojans in cryptographic 3PIP core leak sensitive information like encryption keys. Most of the proposed methods to detect or prevent the influence of hardware Trojans require a Trojan free model of the Intellectual Property (IP). The main issue with these methods is that many 3PIP cores come as black boxes which prevent designers from having access to the internal workings of the core.This work implements a method that curtails the effects of a hardware Trojan in 3PIP cryptographic cores without having access to the inner working of the design. The synthesis results indicate an area, flip-flop, and Look-up-Table overhead of 7.7%, 10.6%, and 4.6% respectively. Improvements/Applications: The proposed method is applicable to hardware design houses that integrate untrusted 3PIP cores in their designs.Improvingthe resource consumption of the proposed method will be addressed in future works.",60068689,Hanbat National University,Yusong,South Korea,['1700'],22.923076923076923,0.08640350877192983,0.40614035087719297,1

The numerical method approach for modelling the carbon nanotubes and nanocomposite materials is proven and effective, but nevertheless has some disadvantages. Also, different defects within carbon nanotubes structure, like vacancies, as well as the waviness of the nanotubes, considerably influence the mechanical properties of the nanotubes and thus deteriorate the final mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. The paper at hand presents and examines the equivalent beam finite element model of single and double walled carbon nanotubes of different patterns, based on the data obtained by structural mechanics FEM model from authors' previous works.

1190,1190,Investigation of multilevel inverter for the next distributed generation using low-cost microcontroller,"J. Strossmayer University of Osijek , Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology. All rights reserved.Nowadays, more research projects have described a converter that is widely used at the distributed generation (DG) level in order to increase the amount of electrical power generation. The converter is known as an inverter when only one DG source is used or as a multi-inverter when several DGs are used. Here, the application of a multilevel inverter with a C2000 microcontroller (Texas Instruments (TI) TMS320F28335 microcontroller), which can be implemented with a current feedback loop, is investigated. This microcontroller acts as a communication interface between MATLAB SIMULINK and the multilevel inverter. Meanwhile, the current control model is modeled in MATLAB for designing the control strategy. It is where the multilevel inverter switches are triggered by using pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals generated by the microcontroller output. At the same time, the proportional integral derivative (PID) current control is used in order to allow the loadcurrent to follow the reference current. Basedon the results, it can be summarizedthat the multilevelinverter is a very useful device for the next DG sources when it is combined with current control for load current distribution. From this investigation, it can be seen that in the future DGs could be connected to a multilevel inverter structure, where it will reduce the dependency on filter design and have a more sinusoidal output to the load for different DG power ratings.",60090656,Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia,Batu Pahat,Malaysia,"['1708', '1705']",21.818181818181817,0.080625,0.35312499999999997,1

Methods/Statistical analysis: In this study, we propose an optical sensor module for the hydrogen storage tank of a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle charging station. A fiber Bragg grating device with a sensor was constructed to monitor strain variations in order to measure the level of liquid hydrogen in the hydrogen storage tank. Findings: A fuel cell vehicle injects liquid hydrogen from a hydrogen station and operates on the electrical energy obtained it. Hydrogen stations have a risk of explosion. If an electrically operable element that can detect the level of the combustible liquid used, combustible vapor generated from the combustible liquid by the electric arc may ignite and cause a fire or an explosion. Therefore, methods to electrically detect the level of liquid pose a risk of safety. This risk can be eliminated by using a fiber module instead of an electrical signal to measure the flow rate and level of hydrogen.In this study, we propose and fabricate a fiber optic sensor for detecting the level of liquid hydrogen using optical signals. A hydrogen gauge based on a pulley type optical sensor module was implemented and its validity was demonstrated through experimental verification of each component. Improvements/Applications: The results demonstrate that the proposed optical fiber sensor can stably detect the level of liquid hydrogen while preventing the risk of fire or explosion by using optical signals.",60026511,Honam University,Gwangju,South Korea,['1700'],25.4,0.1,0.4,1
1202,1202,Stochastic request handling and mutual request handling scheme for enhancing the performance and security of noc in internet of things platform,"The design paradigm of Network-on-Chip (NoC) has been viewed as an empowering solution for the integration of an extremely great number of storage and computational blocks in a single chip in Internet things Platform (IoT). Network congestion is a main drawback of the NoC performance; because of this packet delay is increased and data reliability has decreased. Thus, this paper proposes a stochastic request handling and mutual request handling scheme to avoid packet delay in NoC in IoT platform to improve the performance and reliability of data. The proposed NoC based node storage has emerged as solution to enhance the packet throughput and improve reliability of data. This ideaology is useful in applications such as soldier health monitoring, Bio-medical sector, Data security, cloud management services etc. It supports a high degree of reusability, parallelism and scalability in network performance during data analysis from Soldiers. The newly proposed NoC-based stochastic request handling system allows Dynamic Queuing (DQ) Process to reduce the error rate and improve the performance. However, the DQ process suffers from queuing stability problem. In order to overcome this problem, work was proposed to support symmetric and asymmetric queue process which helps to monitor an uncountable number of soldiers.

A critical step in the Cryo-EM pipeline is 3D refinement. In this procedure, an initial 3D map and a set of estimated projection orientations is refined to obtain higher resolution maps. State-of-the-art refinement techniques rely on projection matching steps in order to refine the initial projection orientations. Unfortunately projection matching is computationally inefficient and it requires a finite discretization of the space of orientations. To avoid repeated projection matching steps, in this work we consider the orientation variables in their continuous form. This enables us to formulate the refinement problem as a joint optimization problem that refines the underlying density map and orientations. We use alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and gradient descent steps in order to update the density map and the orientations, respectively.

Then the decompressed and smoothed BPG image is used for calculation and quantization of DCT coefficients in 8x8 image blocks using quantization tables of the source JPEG image. A difference between obtained quantized DCT coefficients and quantized DCT coefficients of the source JPEG image (prediction error) is calculated. The difference is lossless compressed by a proposed context modeling and arithmetical coding. In this way the source JPEG image is replaced by two files: compressed BPG image and the compressed difference which needed for lossless restoration of the source JPEG image.

1210,1210,A study for the behavior of mechanical property around through defects on the thin tube,"Background/Objectives: This paper is to investigate the mechanical properties occurring around the penetration defects when the bending moment acts on the thin tube. Methods/Statistical analysis: We analyze the stress occurring when a holepasses through a thin tube with regularly arranged tubes of different diameters using the finite element analysis, which is a numerical analysis technique. The hole was treated as a micro-defect. We calculated the maximum stresses in the case of no micro hole and micro hole, and analyzed the influence of the through micro hole by comparing the ratio of the maximum stresses. Findings: The stress ratio is the same or slightly decreased even if the displacement increases at 0°. Based on this result, the result was obtained that the stress concentration effect is hardly observed even when there is a micro circular hole at 0°.When the twist angle was 0.03°, the stress ratio was 13 or more when the displacement was small. As the displacement increases, the ratio of the stress decreases sharply, and when the displacement exceeds 5 mm, the difference of stresses between the cases with and without defects is not very large. The displacement with the maximum stress ratio gradually decreases with increasing displacement. When the torsion angle is 0.21 or more, it is seen that the stress value increase is low even if there is a micro circular hole. In the presence of defects, the stress is larger than the case where there is no defect as a result of the prediction. When the deformation amount is less than 9 mm, the difference of the maximum stress depending on the presence or absence of the defect is increased. However, when the deformation amount is more than 9 mm, the difference of the maximum stress is not large.

1212,1212,A review on rectangular heat sinks under natural convection,"In the paper review of studies of heat sinks under natural convection is taken up. The discussions are mainly on experimental works carried out on rectangular fin arrays, optimization of heat sink dimensions and heat transfer enhancement. The geometries of heat sinks, fin spacing, fin height, fin length, fin thickness and fin material and base to ambient temperature difference are the important parameters on which heat transfer rate depends. So the design and optimization of the heat sink geometries becomes essential. It was found that the optimum fin spacing is ranging from 6.1-11.9mm which gives maximum heat dissipation; the base to ambient temperature difference is 20-1500C. During most of the experimental work carried out a good thermal conductivity material which is cost-effective was chosen.",60104193,Karnatak Law Society’s Gogte Institute of Technology,Belgaum,India,['1700'],20.666666666666668,0.06666666666666665,0.5416666666666666,1

1214,1214,Method of hardenability bands calculation for low alloy steels," Published by Elsevier B.V.Method of hardenability bands calculation for low-alloy steels has been proposed. The method is based on the Grossman method for calculating hardenability from chemical composition, included in the ASTM A255 standard. In contrast to the ASTM method, which allows calculating hardenability curves for a certain chemical composition, the proposed method allows calculating hardenability band for a range of compositions of a certain steel grade. For calculating a hardenability band, several hundred virtual heats with different chemical compositions are generated. The method can be used for hardenability based selection of steels for manufacturing quenched and tempered parts, as well as for developing quenching regimes for parts made of steels for which there is no reference hardenability data. As a part of the verification of the method, calculation results have been compared with hardenability bands for different steel grades present in various metal products specifications.

Furthermore, for use cases which have a bidirectional dependency between communication and mobility, changes in communication lead to changes in mobility and vice versa, thus requiring an online coupling between models. Therefore, bidirectional coupling to incorporate realistic mobility patterns is state of the art in the analysis of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) applications. However, the same need exist for use cases where the mobile users are pedestrians rather than vehicles. Therefore, this paper introduces our current, on-going work on connecting OMNeT++ and Vadere, an open source simulation framework for microscopic pedestrian dynamics, to benefit from state of the art pedestrian mobility models in mobile communication use cases.

1218,1218,"Autocorrelation-based, passive, non-contact photoplethysmography: Computationally-efficient, noise-tolerant, extraction of heart rates from video"," All rights reserved.Photoplethysmography (PPG) is the detection of blood flow or pressure by optical means. The most common method involves direct skin-contact measurement of light from an LED. However, the small color changes in skin under normal lighting conditions, as recorded by conventional video, potentially allow passive, non-contact, PPG. Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) was used to demonstrate that small color changes in a subject's face can be amplified to make them visible to a human observer. A variety of methods have been applied to extract heart rate from video. The signal obtained by PPG is not a simple sinusoid, but has a relatively complex structure, which in video is degraded by ambient lighting variations, motion, noise, and a low sampling rate. Although EVM and many other analysis methods in the literature essentially operate in the frequency domain, fitting the video data to their model requires extensive preprocessing. In this paper a time-based autocorrelation method is applied directly to the video signal that exhibits superior noise rejection and resolution for detecting quasi-periodic waveforms. The method described in the current work avoids both the preprocessing computational cost and the potential signal distortions.",60015941,University of Kentucky,Lexington,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",21.22222222222222,0.061542443064182197,0.4828674948240166,0

1221,1221,Evaluation of mobile augmented reality application for building evacuation," All rights reserved.Building occupants must know how to properly exit a building should the need ever arise. Being aware of appropriate evacuation procedures eliminates (or reduces) the risk of injury and death occurring during an existing catastrophe. Augmented reality (AR) is increasingly being sought after as a teaching and training tool because it offers a visualization and interaction capability that captures the learner’s attention and enhances the learner’s capacity to retain what was learned. Utilizing the visualization and interaction capability that AR offers and the need for emergency evacuation training, this paper explores mobile AR application (MARA) constructed to help users evacuate a building in the event of an emergency such as a building fire, active shooter, earthquake, and similar circumstances. The MARA was built for Android-based devices using Unity and Vuforia. Its features include the use of intelligent signs (i.e. visual cues to guide users to the exits) to help users evacuate a building. Inter alia, this paper discusses the MARA’s implementation and its evaluation through a user study utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the System Usability Scale (SUS) frameworks.

Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians arise naturally when one wish to study a subsystem interacting with a continuum of states. Moreover, quantum subsystems with probability sinks or sources are naturally described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Herein, we discuss a non-Hermitian formalism based on the density matrix. We show both how to derive the equations of motion of the density matrix and how to define statistical averages properly. It turns out that the laws of evolution of the normalized density matrix are intrinsically non-linear. We also show how to define correlation functions and a non-Hermitian entropy with a non zero production rate. The formalism has been generalized to the case of hybrid quantum-classical systems using a partial Wigner representation. The equations of motion and the statistical averages are defined analogously to the pure quantum case. However, the definition of the entropy requires to introduce a non-Hermitian linear entropy functional.",60011576,Università degli Studi di Messina,Messina,Italy,['1700'],18.4,0.07142857142857142,0.37,0

1224,1224,Context-free grammar for aspect-oriented UML design modeling diagrams,"It is well known that aspect orientation (AO) has the potential to support the continued smooth running of software programs. In AO, before developing a program that may need to be updated all the aspects (crosscutting concerns) contained therein must be meticulously assessed to ensure that a change to one or more of those aspects will not have an adverse effect on other parts of the program. To address this issue, in this paper, three main objectives are targeted. First, a formal representation for aspect-oriented unified modeling language (UML) design modeling diagrams is proposed in which context-free grammar (CFG) is used for the aspects. An aspect model encompasses pointcuts, advice, inter-model declarations and aspect precedence, as well as references the behaviors of other classes and aspects. To ensure that there is consistency in a system, the aspect-oriented UML design model of the system is converted into a CFG that consists of set of rules for all the strings that could be present in the formal language being assessed. Second, the extended Backus–Naur form (EBNF) is applied to represent the CFG rules for the aspect-oriented model. Third, the potential use of the proposed EBNF transformation for all aspect-oriented UML diagrams is investigated. This study is inspired by the results of existing research on object-oriented UML transformation using EBNF. As AO is an extension of object orientation, it seemed natural to extend the idea of using EBNF to AO and assess whether it would be beneficial in transforming aspect-oriented UML modeling diagrams.",60044065,Yarmouk University,Irbid,Jordan,['1700'],25.0,0.09722222222222222,0.40138888888888896,1

The pipeline first performs preprocessing tasks such as intensity normalization or snow pixel modification to better prepare the images, and then localizes various candidate regions of interest (ROIs) where the defects of interest may reside. The resulting candidate ROIs are then analyzed by trained classifier(s) to determine whether the defect is present. The classifiers are trained off-line using labeled training samples. While the system is being used in the real-world, more samples can be gathered. This gives us opportunity to refine and improve the initial models.

Therefore, the results of this study may suggest ways to minimize airflow congestion that may occur in a residential redevelopment project or in a planned area. Methods/Statistical analysis: This study is to analyze the airflow change of the redevelopment block when the poor building in the downtown area is developed as a high-rise building through redevelopment project. For analysis, program used is ECOTECT analysis, an eco-friendly design and environment analysis program. Findings: In low-rise housing complexes that do not have sufficient distance before the housing redevelopment project, airflow is often stagnated or the airflow speed is less than 0.5 m/s. This seems to have the effect of preventing the cold wind in winter, but in urban heat island phenomena, if the airflow stagnates and fails to pass, it increase the atmospheric temperature and causes the urban heat island phenomenon. After the housing redevelopment project, the gap between building and building is widened, so that the airflow in not stagnant in general, and it is possible to reduce the rise of atmospheric heat that can occur in summer and reduce the occurrence of urban heat island phenomenon in winter. It is necessary to suggest ways to plant trees and change the layout of building to prevent airflow.

To further study the influence of solidification condition on the as-cast structure and the relevant mechanism, the numerical investigation of grain growth of pure copper under LVPMF was conducted in the present work. The calculation result indicates that the temperature field and the cooling rate in the melt of pure copper become more uniform for the condition with LVPMF, meanwhile the cooling rate of melt in central region is much higher than the case without LVPMF. It is found the grain refinement by LVPMF is strongly related to the cooling condition. For the case without LVPMF, the larger the cooling rate is, the smaller the arm spacing of columnar grain structure.

1231,1231,Limits of color constancy: Comparison of the signatures of chromatic adaptation and spatial comparisons,"Color Constancy has two hypothetical mechanisms: Chromatic Adaptation and Spatial Comparisons. These mechanisms have different fundamental properties. Adaptation models work with small individual scene segments. They combine radiance measurements of individual segments with the modeler's selected parameters that scale the receptor's cone quanta catches. Alternatively, spatial models use the radiance map of the entire field of view to calculate appearances of all image segments simultaneously. They achieve independence from spectral shifts in illumination by making spatial comparisons within each L, M, S color channel. These spatial comparisons respond to color crosstalk caused by the overlap of spectral sensitivities of cone visual pigments. L, M, and S cones respond to every visible wavelength. Crosstalk causes the spatial comparisons of cone responses to vary with changes in spectral illumination. Color Constancy works best in spatially uniform, and variable spectral illumination. Measurements of Color Constancy show systematic departures from perfect constancy. These limits of Color Constancy are predicted by spatial comparisons with cone Crosstalk. These limits do not correlate with Chromatic Adaptation models. This paper describes cone Crosstalk, and reviews a series of measurements of the limits of Color Constancy in variable spectral, spatial and real-life illuminations.",113660628,McCann Imaging,Arlington,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",13.857142857142858,0.21875,0.46562499999999996,1

In this system, the interaction between the qubits and the resonator field can be achieved by turning the gate voltage and the external flux.The operation time is independent of the number of qubits involved in the scheme, and the gates operations are insensitive to the initial state of the resonator. These quantum logic gates can be realized in a time (nanosecond-scale) much smaller than decoherence time (microsecond-scale), and it is more immune to the 1/f charge noise and has longer dephasing time due to the favorable properties of the transmon qubits in the circuit QED.

The software developed with agile methodology are not secure, because of security is not the phase of in software development models. Therefore security has be inserted externally to the software development model to make the software secure. Security is one of the significant issues in the present profoundly coordinated programming improvement industry. More underscore is on to create a safe programming, in order to limit the measure of hazard and harm brought about by the product utilizing the lithe advancement approach. Creating secure programming with high deft qualities is constantly a hard undertaking to do in view of substantial weight nature of security exercises. In this postulation a novel methodology is proposed by which security exercises which are not the piece of programming improvement models, can be integrated with agile activities. The embodiment of the security activities and agile activities is based upon the fact that as the security activities are heavyweight which may reduce the agility i.e. the measure of rapidness, incremental delivery of the software etc. of the agile methodology is in such a manner that the agility of the agile activities are affected least. For this least impact in nimbleness this methodology the mean readiness estimation of the two exercises for example deft just as security are determined dependent on the different light-footed attributes. The different factors, for example, cost, time, repeat, benefits influencing the deftness of the action are additionally considered. Based upon the importance of these factors a Influencing Factor Value Table (IFVT) are also created for both the activities. By using fuzzy value compatibility table (FVCT), extend of compatibility of embodiment of both the activities is estimated based upon the observations of various software experts.

1237,1237,Hot rolling strips at the casting and rolling unit during coil-to-coil and endless rolling modes," Published by Elsevier B.V.The study of hot rolled steel production technology with an assessment of the impact of the main technological processes and operations on the quality of the finished product, the possibility of expanding the range of steel grades and production efficiency is an important condition for improving the technical level and development of rolling production. Combining the processes of casting billets and hot rolling was a very relevant and economically profitable solution, which in turn was the prerequisite for the creation of casting and rolling units. Production of hot rolled products at the casting and rolling units in compared with the traditional multistep technology, reduces the production cycle and, despite the low production volumes, can compete with the hot rolling mills in the cost of products due to the specific equipment layout and resource-saving and energy-saving technologies. For studying the thermal state of the metal in line of the casting and rolling unit a modular mathematical model was developed. The spatiotemporal temperature distribution of the metal was described with use non-stationary heat conduction equation with boundary conditions of the second and third kinds depending on the type of heat exchange. The algorithm for calculating the production of hot rolled products is based on a combination of modules, each of which describes a specific boundary condition and carries information about the object or objects, as well about the working and additional tools used in the simulation. The model uses the results obtained during laboratory research under plane strain compression on the installation of the Gleeble 3800. Simulation of the rolling process is performed in «Deform 3D». The developed model can be used to study the thermal state of the metal in the hot rolling production of high-quality steel grade.",60012120,Lipetsk State Technical University,Lipetsk,Russian Federation,['1702'],32.33333333333333,0.14103174603174604,0.509920634920635,0

During the master packing process, the three products will be weighing in 3 different line, where each product has weight references (standard). This process less effective considering if there are a new product that has a different weight, because new lines are needed or manufacturing products in turn. When the product does not comply with the standard, rejector will work to separate the product, which will then be checked by the operator. This is usually done manually by using the scales manual. Based on this, a digital scales software is needed. The research methods used are library research method, field research methods, and laboratory research methods.This study aims to design and create a digital weighing software using the ModBus protocol to communicate data from the scales to the program and to read the barcode using scanner through RS-232 serial communication. This new system will also use the jet printer to print the weight of the products with communication over UDP (User Datagram Protocol).Based on the results of the design and testing that carried out on more than 1000 products, the software was able to perform its function properly that gives information about the weight of the product.

With the deterioration of lubrication conditions, the tendency of alloy tubes to crack or fracture is greatly increased. The influence of glass lubricant on the tube hot extrusion procedure of Inconel 625 alloy was investigated by numerical simulation with the ABAQUS software. The results show that the billet temperature and extrusion load increased with the rise of coulomb friction factor. When the coulomb friction factor over 0.15, the billet is overheated. The heat transfer coefficient increase result in the decrease of billet temperature and the rise of extrusion load. In addition, glass lubricants should be reasonably used in actual production to improve lubrication and insulation conditions, which is important to improve the quality and reduce the cost of Inconel 625 alloy tubes during hot extrusion.",60025945,Lanzhou University of Technology,Lanzhou,China,['1702'],23.285714285714285,0.2833333333333334,0.7037037037037037,0

1246,1246,Smart integrated nanosystems for biomedical applications: Critical issues and perspectives," This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).During the last decades the progresses of nanoscience and nanotechnology for biomedical application stimulated the transition from traditional drug delivery systems to the development of smart integrated nanosystems with stimuli-responsive characteristics. A wide range of smart integrated nanosystems have proven their effectiveness for various types of biomedical tasks, including stimuli-responsive liposomes, polymeric and metal nanoparticles, silica and hybrid (organic/inorganic) nanostructures. Moreover, these nanoplatforms include the possibility to develop within the same nano-platform a diagnostic imaging system with the monitoring of the temporal evolution of the molecular response of a disease for each patient. This theranostic approach could enable the selection of the appropriate treatment therapy planning, thus paving the way for the modern approach of the personalized medicine. However, these nano-structured platforms present lack of toxicity assessment tests, and lack of experience between the pre-clinical and clinical studies, thus resulting in the huge difficulties to obtain regulatory and ethics approval. As a result, most of these relatively complex stimulus-sensitive/responsive nano-platforms are not currently approved for clinical use. In this article we review the main breakthroughs for the rational design of theranostic nano-systems for therapeutic treatment in nanomedicine. We also discuss the open questions with the aim of offering possible novel insights to overcame the critical issues which are still present when we want to translate theranostic approaches into the clinical practise.",60021199,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,Rome,Italy,['1700'],30.375,0.10432900432900434,0.4663961038961039,0
1247,1247,A comparison of bound-constrained and positivity-constrained optimization method to estimate head tissue conductivities by scalp voltage information,"J. Strossmayer University of Osijek , Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology. All rights reserved.Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive method used to estimate the conductivity of head tissues. Estimation based on the unconstrained Gauss-Newton (GN) method is conventional, but it may result in negative-value or extraordinary high-value estimates, which are unexpected. In this study, the bound-constrained method and the positivity-constrained optimization method were investigated and compared to the unconstrained optimization method. A two-dimensional model was created for conductivity estimation containing five head tissues, i.e., the scalp, the skull, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM), and white matter (WM). The results showed that the accuracy, the robustness, and the estimation convergence of the estimation of this approach were significantly improved by constraining. All unexpected values also disappeared. The investigation proved that very high sensitivity of the skull region caused the unexpected outcome of the unconstrained cases. This high sensitivity can be significantly reduced by constraining. However, a degree of estimation nonlinearity can be increased by constraining as well, causing some estimation accuracies in the case of the positivity-constrained optimization method to be poor. Therefore, it is recommended to use only the bound-constrained optimization method.",60000316,Srinakharinwirot University,Bangkok,Thailand,"['1708', '1705']",16.583333333333336,0.07056507936507937,0.6166095238095238,1

Using point clouds is a popular way to represent volumetric video for augmented or virtual reality applications. This representation, however, requires a large number of points to achieve a high quality of experience and needs compression before storage and transmission. In this paper, we study the subjective and objective quality assessment results for volumetric video compression, using a state-of-the-art compression algorithm: MPEG Point Cloud Compression Test Model Category 2 (TMC2). We conduct subjective experiments to find the perceptual impacts on compressed volumetric video with different quantization parameters and point counts. Additionally, we find the relationship between the state-of-the-art objective quality metrics and the acquired subjective quality assessment results. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to consider TMC2 compression for volumetric video represented as coloured point clouds and study its effects on the perceived quality.

1251,1251,A SVM model for candidate y-chromosome gene discovery in prostate cancer," All rights reserved.Prostate cancer is widely known to be one of the most common cancers among men around the world. Due to its high heterogeneity, many of the studies carried out to identify the molecular level causes for cancer have only been partially successful. Among the techniques used in cancer studies, gene expression profiling is seen to be one of the most popular techniques due to its high usage. Gene expression profiles reveal information about the functionality of genes in different body tissues at different conditions. In order to identify cancer-decisive genes, differential gene expression analysis is carried out using statistical and machine learning methodologies. It helps to extract information about genes that have significant expression differences between healthy tissues and cancerous tissues. In this paper, we discuss a comprehensive supervised classification approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to investigate differentially expressed Y-chromosome genes in prostate cancer. 8 SVM models, which are tuned to have 98.3% average accuracy have been used for the analysis. We were able to capture genes like CD99 (MIC2), ASMTL, DDX3Y and TXLNGY to come out as the best candidates.

In order of the wide use of aluminum alloy the study on the joining method of steel and aluminum dissimilar materials is very important. In order to expose the mechanism of the interface bonding between steel and aluminum dissimilar materials under the thermal and mechanical coupled loading, steel sheets were joined to 6061 aluminum sheets by a thermal and mechanical simulation system. The applied temperature and pressure were both able to be controlled precisely in the Gleeble simulation testing system. The effects of welding temperature and zinc coating on interfacial bonding were both studied. It was shown that without zinc coating a continuous interface layer between the steel and aluminum could be observed when the temperature was above 550°C. There was a FeAl3 phase existing in the interface layer with a high micro hardness. When welding temperature higher than 550°C the shear strength of the joint increased with temperature.

1261,1261,M-QuBE3: Querying big multilayer graph by evolutive extraction and exploration," All rights reserved.Although node-link representations of graphs are widespread and even sometimes preferred to other approaches, they suffer from obvious limitations when graphs become large or dense, inducing visual cluttering and impeding the traditional visual information seeking process. This article presents a new strategy of exploration particularly suitable when graphs are large and dense. Users iteratively drive the exploration through the visualization of small sub-networks of interest. Our technique is particularly useful with multilayer networks, where layers typically combine into a large and dense network. Our iterative exploration process called M-QuBE3 computes a score for each node of a graph based on structural and semantic information where more interesting nodes from a user point of view have higher scores. This in turn translates into a procedure to select sub-networks of interest. Within each sub-network, the user can select nodes to enhance the semantic context (and thus impact their interest score) and iteratively refine the exploration towards more relevant sub-networks. The M-QuBE3 process natively handles multilayer network and allows the use of layers as a semantic apparatus when driving the navigation.",60105942,Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology,Esch-sur-Alzette,Luxembourg,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",22.625,0.17986411736411737,0.4397366522366523,0

Dynamic Light Scattering measurements were carried out in the physiological temperature range up to 45◦C. The analysis of the results provided the temperature dependences of the macromolecular hydrodynamic radius and the ζ-potential. For albumin the hydrodynamic radius remained unchanged, while the ζ-potential increased sharply at approximately 40◦C. For fibrinogen the radius increased significantly above 45◦C and the ζ-potential increased similar to albumin at slightly below 40◦C. The dynamics of albumin macromolecule was simulated using classical Molecular Dynamics, which showed no change in the gyration radius, root mean square deviation, and the composition of disulfide and salt bridges, but substantial change in the secondary structure of the protein. We conclude that these changes in the structure and dynamics of the proteins are correlated with the qualitative change of water dynamics at 42◦C in the hydration shell of the proteins.",60070112,Palladin Institute of Biochemistry of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine,Kiev,Ukraine,['1700'],26.428571428571427,-0.015476190476190473,0.37291666666666673,0

The case study involved two students who had repeated the same writing course in three consecutive semesters. The research had two main objectives. One was to explore the challenges the repeaters faced in learning second language writing and the other was to elicit their needs with regard to learning that particular skill. The main data collection method was face-to-face semi-structured interviews. With regard to the difficulties that the repeaters faced in learning ESL writing, they highlighted low motivation and their inability to identify their own weaknesses in writing as their main challenges. They also pointed that these problems were further aggravated by lack of support from their teachers. In terms of their needs, the repeaters cited that they would want individual help and support from their writing teachers so that they could learn and perform better.

1265,1265,Quack: A youth-targeted game for english comprehension," All rights reserved.Second grade is a critical year in the development of a child’s understanding of literature. Studies have shown that students who struggle with reading at the second grade will continue to struggle with reading for the rest of their lives. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new method for increasing English comprehension for at-risk youth. In this paper we propose a fun and easy-to-use game called Quack. Our approach is to leverage new technologies with an existing school program, such as one-on-one mentoring, in addition to a targeted English comprehension game to enhance the educational experience of second graders struggling with reading comprehension. The Quack game implements a spelling challenge system to test the student’s vocabulary and spelling ability. Part of the game, an options system, allows instructors and students to customize the experience to each individual’s needs. Quack provides a novel approach to educational gaming through three new concepts: (i) Quack is free to use and open source (ii) Quack is customizable to the individual’s English comprehension needs (iii) Quack incorporates a rewarding English-comprehension system, effectively “gamifying” learning proper spelling.",60009841,Central Michigan University,Mount Pleasant,United States,['1700'],23.375,0.014363636363636356,0.39854545454545454,0
1266,1266,Study on welding deformation numerical simulation for ultrahigh strength steel BS960E," Published by Elsevier B.V.Now days there are more and more customers using high-strength steel and ultra-high-strength steel. Upon the steel sales expanding, welding deformation control is one of the most challenges encountered in its application. In this paper, the welding deformation of ultra-high strength steel BS960E is studied by means of welding numerical simulation. The results are as shown as following. 1) The solid-state phase transformation occurring in HAZ of ultra-high strength steel has a significant impact on the prediction of welding deformation. The reason is that Bainite and Martensite phase transformation have a great impact on the welding deformation during the welding process. 2) The proportion of Martensite and Bainite phase transformation in the HAZ of the ultra-high strength steel BS960E has little influence on its welding deformation. The model of welding deformation of ultra high strength steel based on solid-state phase transformation improves the prediction accuracy greatly.",60089797,"Baoshan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd.",Shanghai,China,['1702'],18.75,0.38305555555555554,0.5572222222222222,0
1267,1267,Enhanced guided image filter using trilateral kernel for disparity error correction,"Stereo matching methods estimate the depth information from stereoscopic images using the characteristics of binocular disparity. We try to find corresponding points from the left and right viewpoint images to obtain the disparity map. Once we get the disparity value between the two correspondences, we can calculate the depth information of the object. If there is no texture in the image, the stereo matching operation may not find the accurate disparity value. Especially, it is quite difficult to estimate correct disparity values in occluded regions. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect disparity errors in the disparity map and correct those errors using the enhanced guided image filter (GIF). An error correction using the GIF causes disparity-smoothing near the occluded region because of a coefficient-smoothing process in the GIF. Thus, our method employs a trilateral kernel for the coefficient smoothing process to alleviate the problem.",60068688,Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology,Gwangju,South Korea,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",18.5,0.06029684601113172,0.5747990105132963,1

1271,1271,Alkylphosphates as low-cost inhibitors in silver tarnishing," This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Tarnishing is a process taking place in silver surface causing corrosion. This is due to the presence in the atmosphere, even in small amounts, of reactive species like water, sulphidric acid and carbonyl sulphide which can be physisorbed onto the silver surface thus reacting with it. We propose the use of alkylphosphates to protect the silver surface against corrosion: the polar head group should interact with the silver surface with the formation of a thin film of opportunely oriented surfactant molecules. This would shield the silver surface from the attack of reactive agents present in the atmosphere and from the adsorption of humidity water helped by the surfactant scarce hydrophilicity. The joint Raman and XPS experiments showed the protective action exerted by dibutylphosphate or bis (2-etylhexyl) phosphate according to the different sulphidizing conditions.

The drivers' efforts to take back control from the automation are accompanied by a change of driving behavior and may lead to increased error rates, altered headways, safety critical situations, and, in the case of a failing takeover, even to minimum risk maneuvers. In this work we present modeling approaches for these processes, which have been introduced into SUMO recently in the framework of the TransAID project.

In the first part of the paper, by the example of fission materials we demonstrate the chain of MD simulation techniques developed to evaluate material properties change due to self-irradiation (so-called ageing). Starting from detailed microscopic Monte Carlo + MD calculations of damage cascade development and annealing resulting in a system of Primary Radiation Defects (PRD), the problems of PRD and radiogenic products accumulation and clustering are resolved by the application of Thermodynamic Integration Method. Finally, virtual samples of a material containing defects of determined morphology corresponding to a given age are subjected to a ‘mechanical loading' to evaluate the effect of self-irradiation on mechanical strength properties. In the second part we consider issues of MD simulations of nano-structured materials, including effects of samples processing history (dislocation density) on mechanical properties, solidification and thermal recrystallization, as well as resistance to radiation loading.

The energy expended in the test mode has been found to be often much higher than in normal mode. This project aims mainly for the creation of an effective RAM based on MGDI and a low power Test Pattern Generator. LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) is commonly employed in various Built in Self-Test (BIST), cryptography applications to generate pseudo-random numbers. Its theory discusses the possibilities of reducing energy during research applications on VLSI complementary metal oxide (CMOS) systems as power consumption during tests remains higher in contrast to normal operation. By selectively choosing the appropriate reversible gates for RAM design, this concept will be useful for low density and low power applications. A novel design of these 16*8 RAM architecture is designed with modified Gate Diffusion Technique for further improvement of area and power. Development of Low Transition Test Pattern Generators (TPGs) remains a common way of reducing consumption of power. In the Linear Feedback Shift Register with Low Density Modified Low Transition Low Power (LDMLTLP), dissipation of power during the experiment is minimized by lowering the switching operation between successive test vectors in contrast to two subsequent test vectors.

As technology evolved, it has become usual to exploit virtual reality and serious games as tools for motor and cognitive rehabilitation. However, despite the increasing use of games in rehabilitation, evidence of the impact of their use in multi user settings remains scarce. To our knowledge, there are no comparative studies on stroke patients assessing the specific benefits of Competitive, Cooperative and Collaborative gaming modes for motor rehabilitation. In this study we propose to use a multiplayer motor rehabilitation gaming system, and evaluate the impact that these different game modes can have on patient's engagement and social involvement, and also to research the influence that different motor and cognitive skill levels can produce in those three different multiplayer settings. To that end, we developed a multiplayer setup - using tangible objects and a large screen interactive table - for upper limb rehabilitation purposes. We implemented a game that, while keeping the same basic mechanics, can be played on the three different multiplayer modes (Competitive, Cooperative and Collaborative). We performed a preliminary study with 11 stroke patients, and results show that behavioral involvement and positive affect is promoted more effectively with the Collaborative mode, specifically with participants with less motor and cognitive difficulties.",60016979,Universidade da Madeira,Funchal,Portugal,['1705'],27.125,0.01547103689960833,0.39360441146155434,1

1285,1285,Violence and partition: Representation of women in amrita pritam’s Pinjar,"The partition of the sub-continent was one of the most distressing and bloodiest massacres in the history. Partition created fissures among the people and countries. The partition of the Indian sub-continent was announced by Lord Mountbatten on 3rd June, 1947. The declaration of the splitting of the continent leads to mass exodus of people. This exodus leads to brutal killings on both sides. That is why the separation is often remembered as one of the bloodiest massacre in the history of India. Ritu Menon and Kamla Bhasin in Borders and Boundaries define partition ‘as the unfortunate outcome of sectarian and separatist politics and as a tragic accompaniment to the exhalation and promise of a freedom fought for with courage and valor.’(3) The intensity of violence and the brutality held at the time of partition is the matter of conversation in this proposed paper in novel Pinjar by Amrita Pritam.

1287,1287,Trust based cluster head selection with secure routing algorithm for wireless sensor network,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) contain an excellent quantity of battery-driven small nodes that have sensing, computing and communication capabilities. Therefore, it's essential to design an energy-efficient routing protocol to cleverly use the limited energy of WSNs. One-way of managing the energy efficiency is grouping sensors to form a cluster and choose a node as lead to manage referred to as cluster head (CH). In case a malicious node or lower energy node is chosen as a cluster head, the throughput of the network is greatly affected. Thus selection of cluster heads with higher trust and residual energy becomes crucial for the overall network performance. To deal with this problem, this work proposes a Trust based Cluster Head Selection with Secure Routing (TCHS_SR) algorithm for wireless sensor network. The proposed method relies on an effective distributed trust model for cluster head selection and it also considers the secure route for data transfer. The experimental result shows that the proposed TCHS_SR algorithm reduces energy consumption and end-to-end delay, furthermore increases the throughput and packet delivery ratio efficiently.",60114767,Sir C.R.Reddy College of Engineering,Eluru,India,['1700'],21.875,0.2611721611721612,0.5635531135531134,1

The combined effect of physical and cognitive tasks is of great interest, as both efforts share central nervous system reserves. Amid a larger study that is aimed to create an ecologically validated virtual reality (VR) - based experimental protocol to explore the effect of high-load physical and cognitive efforts on young individuals, the present report focuses on comparing new cognitive tasks presented in the context of simulated military missions with physical load to already established cognitive testing battery. Twelve young participants performed a 10 Km loaded march on a treadmill in VR settings with or without additional cognitive tasks (VR-COG). Each experimental day, subjects underwent pre-and post-evaluation, in which cognitive (trail making test - the color trail test CTT version, and SYNWIN battery for multitasking evaluation) and physical tests (time to exhaustion test - TTE) were conducted. In general, strong or moderate correlations were found between VR-COG performances and the cognitive tests. The VR-COG tasks, together with CTT components, were able to successfully predict the effect of the combined physical and cognitive load on the multitasking performance. Multitasking was evaluated by the SYNWIN score. We believe that our protocol allows optimal conditions for measurement of the effect of high-load physical and cognitive efforts for an extended period of time, thus contributing to the motor-cognitive interaction model knowledge base.

1310,1310,Dfs ads-b implementation in high density radar controlled airspace – experiences and challenges," All rights reserved.The German Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) is operating a surveillance infrastructure mainly based on radars and multilateration systems, which provides surveillance information and receives aircraft derived data. The implementation and use of the new surveillance technology Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) has to provide benefits in terms of safety, performance or costs. DFS operations require a permanent double surveillance coverage for the area of responsibility. This requirement actually means triple surveillance coverage (in order to provide a seamless service also in case of system outages or planned down times). DFS is implementing ADS-B as the third surveillance layer to reduce costs. Each surveillance layer has to fulfil the performance and safety requirements independently. The fulfilment of safety requirements, integrity and continuity, will require validation of the passively received ADS-B information. Data integrity and continuity need to be considered w.r.t. safety requirements, but may also have to address security. The integrity of ADS-B data can be ensured either by comparison with data from other surveillance sensors (dependent validation) or by analyzing the properties of the data itself (independent validation). The independent validation of the ADS-B data is a necessary prerequisite for providing a self-contained independent surveillance layer using the ADS-B technology. In a first step, DFS will implement ADS-B as a dependent layer: (1) for validation of the assumption on surveillance performance, (2) to gain experience on data integrity and data continuity, (3) to prepare possible mitigations e.g. against spoofing or jamming and (4) to recognize potential shortcomings in the airborne installations and identify possible mitigations. This first step will support necessary developments (e.g. ADS-B Validation Unit) to move with ADS-B towards the use as an independent surveillance layer reducing infrastructure costs and improve radio spectrum protection.",107192752,DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH,Langen,Germany,['1700'],19.666666666666668,-0.005796602387511482,0.4065197428833793,0

1315,1315,High-dimensionality graph data reduction based on a proposed new algorithm," All rights reserved.In recent years, graph data analysis has become very important in modeling data distribution or structure in many applications, for example, social science, astronomy, computational biology or social networks with a massive number of nodes and edges. However, high-dimensionality of the graph data remains a difficult task, mainly because the analysis system is not used to dealing with large graph data. Therefore, graph-based dimensionality reduction approaches have been widely used in many machine learning and pattern recognition applications. This paper offers a novel dimensionality reduction approach based on the recent graph data. In particular, we focus on combining two linear methods: Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE) method with the aim of preserving the local neighborhood information of a given dataset, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method with aims of maximizing the mutual information between the original high-dimensional data sets. The combination of NPE and PCA contributes to proposing a new Hybrid dimensionality reduction technique (HDR). We propose HDR to create a transformation matrix, based on formulating a generalized eigenvalue problem and solving it with Rayleigh Quotient solution. Consequently, therefore, a massive reduction is achieved compared to the use of PCA and NPE separately. We compared the results with the conventional PCA, NPE, and other linear dimension reduction methods. The proposed method HDR was found to perform better than other techniques. Experimental results have been based on two real datasets.",60018805,Deakin University,Geelong,Australia,['1700'],21.0,0.106366341991342,0.44334415584415593,0

This cancer is caused by various factors such as mutagenic substances and carcinogenic chemicals in the environment. Overexpression of some genes including CA125 and HE4 is involved in ovarian cancer. CA125 tumor marker is considered a tumor index to confirm disease diagnosis, determine the extent of the disease and evaluate the response to treatment and application in non-mucinous epithelial ovarian tumors. Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) has been approved for the evaluation of disease or progression of ovarian epithelial cancer. The medical smoke from natural resources is used in many countries around the world. One of these medicinal smokes is the smoke from burning the female donkey dung called Anbar Nesara. Anbar Nesara can be used as a useful drug for treating diseases such as sinusitis, cold and cervical and vaginal diseases. Material and method:Anbar Nesara contains large amounts of organic materials and nitrogen and also plant materials consumed by the animal. MTT test was performed by the triplicate method. Then, the effect of CA125 and HE4 biomarkers on cells was evaluated. Results:The results of MTT‏ assay demonstrated that the cells of both lines show a significant dose-dependent decrease in CA125 and HE4 gene expression in treatment withAnbar Nesara, which may be a reason for the tumor suppressive effect through apoptosis.

The sample includes 129 rights offerings and 142 private placement announcements during the period 2002 to 2012. We use two measures of discretionary current accruals (DCA): i) cross-sectional modified-Jones model (1991) developed by Dechow,Sloan and Sweeney (1995); and ii) cross-sectional modified-Jones model adjusted for return on assets (ROA) as utilised by Bartov, Gul and Tsui (2001). We find that unit offerings firms manage earnings upward prior to the announcements and we do not find any evidence of earnings management around rights offerings of equity and private placement. This means that firms issuing equity offeringsvia rights issue or private placement methods, do not manage earnings prior to the announcement. It further suggests that the management of earnings prior to corporate events depends on institutional features that vary internationally. The DCA is derived from the modified-Jones cross-sectional model as a dependent variable in the cross-sectional regression analysis, and we report that firms with higher operating cash flows and higher total current accruals are significantly related to discretionary currents accruals.

Subjects can observe the model from various directions: the orientation of the model's trunk doesn't accord with that of the subjects when viewing from a direction other than from behind the model. It prevents the subjects from learning the model's reference motions easily because the subjects need to rotate the model mentally (it is called the ""mental rotation""). On the other hand, when viewing from behind the avatar in order to avoid the mental rotation cost, subjects would occasionally encounter occlusion problems. Therefore, we have studied perceptual characteristics of various observation views through a psychophysical experiment. Two kinds of physical values were employed for evaluating subject's responses. One is the delayed time for reproduced motion onset, and the other is the error rate of reproduced motion direction. The results suggest that the perception suffers ill-effects from the mental rotation in two ways: the amount of the mental rotation increases the delayed time, and the presence of the mental rotation does the directional errors.",60018873,Mie University,Tsu,Japan,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",22.22222222222222,-0.08446969696969697,0.42543290043290033,1

1360,1360,An improved energy efficient routing through a rotated and polled clustering protocol (GCRCHS) in WSN,"Wireless sensor networks have been gaining widespread significance both in terms of research as well as its widespread utility due to its immense potential that could be effectively harnessed for a number of remote applications which include monitoring and surveillance followed by control. Nodes form the backbone for any wireless sensor network and are provided with limited power and processing capabilities. These nodes sense the information from source and relay them to the destination or base station. Routing is an integral part of any WSN implementation as it defines the flow of data path from source to destination in an optimal manner. Clustering have been researched actively in recent times due to their inherent ability to drastically reduce the network complexity by grouping them based on some similarity measure. The issue of clustering has been effectively utilized in this research paper by proposing a partition based clustering and rotated clustering policy based routing mechanism for a typical wireless sensor network. This algorithm has been compared against benchmark techniques such as LEACH, C-LEACH, E-LEACH and HEED protocols which are a class of hierarchical routing methods. Performance comparison with respect to network lifetime justifies the superiority of the proposed GCRCHS (graph cut rotated cluster head selection model) over the other techniques.",60027171,Annamalai University,Chidambaram,India,['1700'],26.125,-0.024084249084249085,0.5629120879120879,1
1361,1361,On the robustness of active learning," All rights reserved.Active Learning is concerned with the question of how to identify the most useful samples for a Machine Learning algorithm to be trained with. When applied correctly, it can be a very powerful tool to counteract the immense data requirements of Artificial Neural Networks. However, we find that it is often applied with not enough care and domain knowledge. As a consequence, unrealistic hopes are raised and transfer of the experimental results from one dataset to another becomes unnecessarily hard. In this work we analyse the robustness of different Active Learning methods with respect to classifier capacity, exchangeability and type, as well as hyperparameters and falsely labelled data. Experiments reveal possible biases towards the architecture used for sample selection, resulting in suboptimal performance for other classifiers. We further propose the new ”Sum of Squared Logits” method based on the Simpson diversity index and investigate the effect of using the confusion matrix for balancing in sample selection.",60022995,Bergische Universitat Wuppertal,Wuppertal,Germany,['1700'],22.714285714285715,-0.038977272727272735,0.6294507575757576,0
1362,1362,Dls-forgetter: An implementation of the dls forgetting calculus for first-order logic," All rights reserved.DLS-Forgetter is a reasoning tool that aims to compute restricted views of a knowledge base of first-order logic formulae via semantic forgetting. Semantic forgetting achieves this by eliminating predicate symbols in an equivalence preserving way up to the remaining symbols. Forgetting has many applications such as information hiding, explanation generation and computing logical difference. DLS-Forgetter combines ideas from two Ackermann-based approaches: the DLS algorithm and a modal logic inference system inspired by the algorithm. The tool enhances the DLS algorithm by incorporating an ordering over the symbols in the forgetting signature. This allows more control over the forgetting process and the application of the elimination rules. The theory behind the tool is provided by a first-order Ackermann calculus, a first-order generalisation of the rules outlined by the modal logic inference system. The purpose of the tool is to provide the research community with an experimental tool to allow further research to be conducted in the area. This paper describes the DLS-Forgetter tool along with its underlying calculus, it outlines the forgetting process used in the implementation, and presents results of an empirical evaluation.",60003771,University of Manchester,Manchester,United Kingdom,['1700'],20.666666666666668,0.027777777777777773,0.49444444444444435,0

By definition, anomalies are rare occurrences, and therefore, annotation of anomalies using human workforce is difficult and costly, as large amounts of mostly non-anomalous data need to be checked. To alleviate this problem, we use satellite images from Planet.com as the source of visual data, and combine them with ADS-B data to detect airplanes in a semi-automatic way. This way, our definition of anomaly is an appearance of an airplane on mostly airplane-free images. This not only speeds up annotation, but also provides the exact specification of what constitutes an anomaly, in an objective way. The resulting meta-dataset, containing references to Planet.com imagery and accurate annotations will be published in the near future.

1377,1377,A contextual deep clustering based intrusion detection method for cloud,"With the growth in the recent internet-based services and the information generated by these services have attracted many attackers to intrude in the services, infrastructure and the information generated by the services. The services many of the times must make itself visible for opening service features to the end user. The intruders take the advantages of these situations for making the attacks on the internet services. Many of the parallel research attempts have aimed to detect the intrusions by automating the process of detections basedon the characteristics of the attacks. Although interruption location frameworks screen systems for conceivably malevolent movement, they are likewise arranged to bogus alerts. Subsequently, associations need to tweak their IDS items when they initially introduce them. It implies appropriately setting up the interruption discovery frameworks to perceive what ordinary traffic on the system resembles when contrasted with vindictive action. Nevertheless, the characteristics-based approaches apply a primary technique called classification for the detection of the attacks or intrusions. Most of the instances, it is been realized that the detection mechanism ignores some of the events as the parametric or characteristics-based detections cannot interpret the contexts of the values for these parameters at some events. This leads to the vulnerability of the security methods deployed to detect and prevent intrusions by attacks. The problem can be resolved using clustering the complete attack situations and identifying the overlaps between the attack events. Nonetheless, the clustering methods can be tricky as a smaller number of clusters can again stimulate the older problem of contextual insensitivity and the greater number of clusters can identify regular accesses also as attacks or intrusions. Henceforth, this work proposes a contextual deep clustering method using the deep analysis of the Euclidian distance measures for finding the accurate number of clusters for better intrusion detection. As an outcome of the research this work demonstrates nearly 90% accuracy in the detection for the overall system and for selected clusters it demonstrates nearly 100% accuracy.",60023311,Osmania University,Hyderabad,India,['1700'],23.357142857142858,0.15266666666666667,0.37774358974358985,1

Studies have established construct validity of VR assessment tools with their paper-and-pencil versions by demonstrating significant associations with their traditional construct-driven measures. However, adaptive rehabilitation tools for intervention are mostly not equivalent to their counterpart paper-and-pencil versions, which makes it difficult to carry out comparative studies.

COHs extend the well-known object-oriented paradigm by adding identity constraints, trigger constraints, goal constraints, and some primary methods that can be used by capable beings to accomplish various intelligence, such as deduction, induction, analogy, recognition, construction, learning and many others. In the paper we will first argue the need for such a generic model of the world and intelligence, and then present the generic model in detail, including its important constructs, the primary methods capable beings can use, as well as how different intelligent behaviors can be implemented and achieved with this generic model.",60018510,Athabasca University,Athabasca,Canada,['1700'],45.0,0.14876543209876544,0.37376543209876545,0

They are instrumental in enabling sound composability properties for complex circuits, and their randomness requirements dominate the performance overheads in (very) high-order masking. In this paper, we improve a proposal of mask refreshing algorithms from EUROCRYPT 2017 that has excellent implementation properties in software and hardware, in two main directions. First, we provide a generic proof that this algorithm is secure at arbitrary orders—a problem that was left open so far. We introduce parametrized non-interference as a new technical ingredient for this purpose that may be of independent interest. Second, we use automated tools to further explore the design space of such algorithms and provide the best known parallel mask refreshing gadgets for concretely relevant security orders.

We have recently shown in healthy subjects that the effect of cross-education is significantly augmented by provision of real-time manipulated bi-modal (visual and kinesthetic) sensory feedback, creating an illusory sensation of voluntary training with the other hand. Here we tested whether this training method may be applicable also in pathological conditions affecting one side of the body. We present here data showing behavioral gain accompanied by changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging dynamics following training with this setup in the case of patient LA, a young man with significant unilateral upper-limb dysfunction stemming from hemi-Parkinson's disease. Following two weeks of daily sessions in which he intensively trained the non-affected upper limb, he showed improvement in motor capacity of the affected limb, accompanied by enhanced activation in the pre-frontal cortex and a widespread increase in functional coupling in the brain.

1390,1390,Differentiable soft quantization: Bridging full-precision and low-bit neural networks,"Hardware-friendly network quantization (e.g., binary/uniform quantization) can ef?ciently accelerate the inference and meanwhile reduce memory consumption of the deep neural networks, which is crucial for model deployment on resource-limited devices like mobile phones. However, due to the discreteness of low-bit quantization, existing quantization methods often face the unstable training process and severe performance degradation. To address this problem, in this paper we propose Differentiable Soft Quantization (DSQ) to bridge the gap between the full-precision and low-bit networks. DSQ can automatically evolve during training to gradually approximate the standard quantization. Owing to its differentiable property, DSQ can help pursue the accurate gradients in backward propagation, and reduce the quantization loss in forward process with an appropriate clipping range. Extensive experiments over several popular network structures show that training low-bit neural networks with DSQ can consistently outperform state-of-the-art quantization methods. Besides, our first efficient implementation for deploying 2 to 4-bit DSQ on devices with ARM architecture achieves up to 1.7× speed up, compared with the open-source 8-bit high-performance inference framework NCNN [31].",60120944,SenseTime Group Limited,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707']",24.285714285714285,0.12115384615384615,0.43653846153846154,1

1410,1410,The techniques of distribute sources of financing long-term investments between the state and oil-producing companies: The experience of Russia and Iraq,"It should be noted that in most countries of the modern world the subsoil belongs to the people (government, state, sovereign)-one of the few, although striking exceptions, is the United States, where some of the subsoil is privatized. The participation of oil producing corporations in the market is usually carried out based on a license for the development of mineral resources, or on the basis of production sharing agreements (PSAs). The difference between the models of such participation is that in the first case, corporations pay fiscal or fixed cash payments for the use of subsoil resources, in the second, they transfer part of the extracted oil to state ownership [1]. In the Russian Federation, both main mechanisms for the distribution of capital and ownership of oil in the oil and gas market are applied. A similar approach is characteristic of many Western states, although the following global trend is taking place: in countries, even the most developed, democratic ones, whose socio-economic development largely depends on oil and gas revenues, states seek either to monopolize oil and gas production, or to maximize state participation and control in this area, combining such a task with ensuring the highest possible revenue differential rent at the expense of the state.",60071176,University of Technology- Iraq,Baghdad,Iraq,['1700'],41.4,0.11428571428571431,0.35054112554112554,1

Multiple advances in technology typical of our modern era overwhelmingly affect today's environment. Operating these technologies, which are necessary for performing a wide variety of basic and instrumental activities of daily living, often require perfecting new manual skills. A touchscreen is an excellent example of a modern technological application which has become prevalent in all aspects of modern life and its use requires fine motor skills to perform a range of activities such as tapping, swiping, and virtual pinching. However, traditional hand assessment tools are not able to capture the skills necessary to operate a touchscreen. The ability to assess these skills is essential for the development of appropriate treatment protocols as well as for determining technological adaptations necessary for making touchscreens accessible to all.The Touchscreen Assessment Tool (TATOO) is a software application developed to comprehensively and objectively assess the hand performance abilities necessary for operating a touchscreen. The current pilot study examined the usability of the TATOO application by individuals in two age groups: elderly individuals (over 75 years) and middle-aged adults (over 45 years). The validity of the TATOO was examined by comparing the performance of the two age groups. Additionally, the correlations between the results of the TATOO and with traditional hand assessment tools (e.g., prehension strength and dexterity) were determined for the elderly group.Usability as assessed with the System Usability Scale was very good in both age groups. Discriminative validity was demonstrated with elderly individuals demonstrating less accurate and significantly longer performance time. No correlation was found between the TATOO variables and prehension strength (grip and pinch strength) or dexterity skills.The TATOO has the potential to become an important novel supplement to the toolbox available to clinical professionals treating the elderly in the modern world.

As a result of this, the manufacturing firms are looking for suppliers with high level of efficiency and better quality. The problem arises when there is wide array of suppliers which are to be selected based on awide range of criteria. This leads to a multi criteria decision making problem i.e., MCDMproblem. Thesuppliers need to be ranked as per their efficiency based on a number of criteria and the best supplier needs to be chosen.The current research work deals with the selection best supplier for a Nickel plating industry using Grey relation analysis &Fuzzy AHP. The grey system theory was developed by Deng Julong of China in 1982.the concept of grey system is Arepresentation of an incomplete or uncertain information system as the grey color lies between black (no information) and white (all information).The method can convert a multiple response problem into a single response optimization problem by finding grey relation grades (GRG).Fuzzy AHP is different from AHP in the sense that it accommodates the imprecision and partial truth or rather the ambiguity in the input data. A hybrid of fuzzy logic with the conventional AHP becomes a much more effective MCDM tool to handle the subjective and linguistic inputs from the survey or feedback. FAHP makes use of a triplet of triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) to include the ambiguity in the priorities during pairwise comparisons. Thecriteria under consideration for supplier selection are,Quality, Warranties& Claims Policies, Production Facilities and Capacity, Geographical Location of the supplier, Packaging Ability& FinancialPosition. Thesecriteria are given grey relation grades using GRA and the three most important criteria are shortlisted. In the next step, the suppliers are evaluated using Fuzzy AHP and the ranked accordingly.

1445,1445,Stock price prediction using lstm on indian share market," All rights reserved.Predicting stock market is one of the most difficult tasks in the field of computation. There are many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. physiological, rational and irrational behavior, investor sentiment, market rumors,etc. All these aspects combine to make stock prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy. We investigate data analysis as a game changer in this domain.As per efficient market theory when all information related to a company and stock market events are instantly available to all stakeholders/market investors, then the effects of those events already embed themselves in the stock price. So, it is said that only the historical spot price carries the impact of all other market events and can be employed to predict its future movement. Hence, considering the past stock price as the final manifestation of all impacting factors we employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques on historical stock price data to infer future trend. ML techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights we didn’t see before, and these can be used to make unerringly accurate predictions.

1447,1447,Exercise intensity is increased during upper limb movement training using a virtual rehabilitation system,"Upper-limb (UL) training interventions are increasingly being developed using virtual reality (VR) platforms. However, since motor recovery is related to exercise intensity and task difficulty, it is important to determine whether these factors are considered in VR applications applied in different centers for patients with different motor impairment levels. We define exercise intensity as the total number of movement repetitions divided by the total minutes in active therapy.The main objective of this study was to determine the training intensity of a clinically-applied treatment program using VR in 3 centers involved in a multi-site study. Our secondary objective was to determine if training intensity differed among patients with different levels of UL sensorimotor impairment.Patients with sub-acute unilateral stroke in the middle cerebral artery area (<6 mo post-stroke) with Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UL) scores ranging from 14-57, completed 10 50-minute UL training sessions with a VR rehabilitation application over 2 weeks, in rehabilitation centers located in 3 countries. Total training time (minutes), total number of movement repetitions, and success rates were extracted from game activity logs. Intensity was calculated for each game for each participant, related to UL impairment and compared between centers.Exercise intensity was higher in one of the 3 centers (p<0.01). Participants had most difficulty with the games involving bilateral coordination and lateral reaching. Participants with higher FMA-UL scores had longer total training times (r = 0.40, p = 0.03) and started the training earlier within the subacute phase (r = -0.38, p = 0.04). Participants who used the VR system later in the subacute phase trained at a higher intensity than those who started earlier (r = 0.43, p = 0.02). However, their level of training intensity was not related to UL impairment.The level of intensity attained with this training program was much higher than that reported in current stroke therapy practice. Despite different training centers, therapists progressed patients through the training program using similar training principles. Therefore, VR rehabilitation systems can be used to deliver intensive exercise programs in a standardized way and can be tailored to individual impairment levels.",60121990,Manipal College of Health professions,Manipal,India,['1705'],28.416666666666668,0.02095238095238095,0.4652380952380953,1

1460,1460,Thermal characteristics analysis of 50kVA individual and shared transformer/reactor model,"Background/Objectives: Transformers and reactors make up the largest share volume and weight of PCS components. Therefore, a shared transformer/reactor was introduce for decrease volume and weight. So characteristic analysis was conducted. Methods/Statistical analysis: The shared model broadens the space between the coil primary and secondary sides of the basic transformer and inserts the reactor core. The individual model (transformer, reactor) was compared with that using a shared transformer/reactor. The comparison characteristic was power, inductance, and thermal analysis. The core and coil were set to the same material and size for a proper comparison. Characterization was performed using finite element analysis (FEA). Findings:The purpose of using a shared transformer / reactor is to increase the effectiveness of the PCS. In particular, the weight and volume can be reduced. Some individual models (transformers, reactors) are commonly used to make a shared transformer/ reactor in a combined form. If each individual model requires two supporters and two spaces, the shared model needs only one supporter and one space. When the individual model was compared with the shared model by finite element analysis, the weight of 50kg was reduced and the model had similar characteristics. And the total volume can save about 3,600〖 cm〗 ^3.This shows that the output density improves from 0.22 kVA/kg to 0.26 kVA/kg. In this process, the distance between the individual models was close to each other. The difference between the thermal and saturation flux density was found. On the other hand, smaller volume and lighter weight devices with the desired power and efficiency can be used to solve this problem. This study examined the interrelationships when common devices are combined. Improvements/Applications: The transformer and reactor are installed separately when using a PCS.

1463,1463,An approach to game prototyping with a tangible interface,"In this paper, we explore the use of tangible user interfaces in the context of prototyping digital game design. Traditional approaches to game design use a combination of digital and nondigital prototyping techniques to identify core game mechanics and object placements when designing levels followed by a labourious process where the non-digital prototypes are translated into digital counterparts in a game engine. The presented system aims at reducing the need for non-digital prototypes by providing an easy to use interface that doesn't require technical expertise and results in a playable digital prototype in a modern game engine. The presented system uses Augmented Reality markers as the tangible interface to facilitate specific functionality in a modern game engine.

This analysis study aims at investigating the thermal and structural characteristics of drum brake by shape. Methods/Statistical Analysis: As the braking system for a car works by changing kinetic energy into thermal energy for braking, we employed the thermal and structural analyses to explain braking situations. After conducting these analysis techniques on models and A and B, both of whichhave different shapes, we compared theresultsto discern the structural characteristics. Based on the findings, the structural characteristics of the drum brakeswere examined by shape. Findings: In this study, we conducted the thermal and structural analyses on drum brake discs. Models A and B variedin the thickness of lining. For model A, the thickness of lining was set to be 40mm, while it was 80mm for model B. From the thermal analysis, we discovered that model B was hotter than model A, which indicated that model B had a higher effect of heat dissipation. In the structural analysis, we confirmed the maximum equivalent stress points of models A and B. Both models had the maximum equivalent stress at the point where the lining and the inside of the drum contacted. The value of maximum equivalent stress on model A was 27.099MPa, while that of model B was 22.433MPa. This difference allowed us to infer that stress distribution varied depending on the liningthickness, and thus low stress could be resultant. Judging from these findings, we could see that the lining wear reduced the braking forces and heating values of the drum brake discs. Improvements/Applications: When comparing the results, the lining thickness due to the wear atdrum brakes can be improved.

The government has established a Consumer Dispute Settlement Agency (BPSK) whose initial goal is to provide legal protection for consumers who are often ignored by the law itself, but in its development BPSK has not run as it should because the fact is that BPSK currently lacks independence because of its position in the ministry trade and industry, from this fact the researchers tried to apply it through the concept of the rule of law. The research method is carried out with a doctrinal and non-doctrinal approach, because the law is not only in concepts as a whole of principles and rules, but also includes institutions and processes that realize the enactment of rules in society. The results of the study are that the concept of consumer protection in the concept of legal state is how to realize the rights and obligations carried out between legal relations of consumers and suppliers of balanced goods or services and must realize the concept of equality before the law and uphold human rights as the main requirement.

On the other hand, petroleum resources are depleting due to the increasing population and scarcity of it. Hence it is necessary to find alternative sources for fossil fuels. Household plastic wastes can be converted into petroleum products by pyrolysis. It gives LDPE, HDPE, and PP. Before pyrolysis shredding, washing and drying of plastic wastes were done manually. The pyrolysis was carried out with and without catalysts at a temperature from 150-degree centigrade to 400-degree centigrade, In this research-based project, selective forms of plastics are situated concerning their catalytic conversion. Further characterization of products and their utility was also screened scientifically to showcase a practical and small-scale option to resolve these significant environmental challenges. Though recycling of plastic waste can be done by thermal, mechanical, chemical means, they have certain limitations. Compared to mechanical and chemical recycling, thermal treatment of plastic waste is gaining more importance in recent years because of the simple process and flexibility in raw material availability. In the pyrolysis process, plastic waste is heated at a higher temperature ranging from 100 to 390 degrees Celsius in absence of oxygen for a certain period for breaking of polymer molecules into monomers and vapours generated are condensed to obtain liquid and gaseous fuel.

1503,1503,Biomedical application of the evolutionary higher-order spectrum," All rights reserved.Most of the biomedical signals are considered non-stationary since the human behavior depends on time. The ECG signal is one of the most important signals in cardiogram analysis. Although it provides a valuable basis for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of several diseases, it can be easily affected by various interferences caused by the power of magnetic field, patient respiratory motion or contraction. The overlapping interference affects the quality of the ECG waveform, leading to a false detection and recognition of wave groups. Therefore, the elimination of the interference of the ECG signal and the subsequent wave group identification has been a hot research topic. Since the ECG signal is not considered a stationary signal, neither the regular power spectrum nor the bispectrum can handle this problem because they do not reflect the time variation of the process characteristics. With the recent introduction of the evolutionary higher-order spectrum (EHOS) in digital signal processing, an approach for analyzing the ECG signal is proposed. The work in this paper is focusing on the reduction of the noise interferences of the ECG signal using the EHOS. This approach exploits the fact that the EHOS contains information regarding both the phase and the magnitude of the signal. Also, we will show that if the ECG signal is corrupted by stationary/non-stationary noise with symmetric distribution, the noise can be eliminated using the properties of the EHOS. Some simulation is declared to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",60025518,Al Qassim University,Buraidah,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],22.363636363636363,0.09861111111111111,0.39668803418803417,0

1513,1513,Mitigation of inrush current in three phase power transformer by prefluxing technique,"Transformers are major component for electrical energy transfer in power system. Stability and security of the transformer protection are important to system operation. At the time of transformer energization, a high current will be drawn by the transformer. The mentioned current is called transient inrush current and it may rise to ten times the nominal full load current of transformer during operation. Energization transients can produce mechanical stress to the transformer, cause protection system malfunction and it often affects the power system quality and may disrupt the operation of sensitive electrical loads such as computers and medical equipment connected to the system. Reduction and the way to control of energization transient currents have become important concerns to the power industry for engineers. One of the methods to reduce inrush current is use of point on wave switching at the time transformer is initially connected to supply. It is called controlled switching or point-on-wave switching. In the point on wave switching, the energization of three phases is controlled according to the residual flux which remains in the transformer. Conventionally, controlled switching or point on wave switching was the method being used to counter this problem, but this method required the knowledge of residual fluxes of transformer before energization which is quite tedious to get. So a technique has been proposed to mitigate inrush current in three phase transformer, by a process called pre-fluxing. After setting the initial fluxes of transformer it is energized by conventional controlled switching. A system of power transformer of specified rating is simulated in MATLAB simulink and results were obtained. This Paper describes the modeling of inrush current of 3-phase, 300 MVA, 11/400 KV, 50 Hz transformer, and mitigation of inrush current with both techniques using point on wave switching and prefluxing.

The research method used is a normative research method by reviewing the laws and regulations and related legal materials. The need to find a fair policy model in terms of the distribution of bankrupt assets between tax debts and labor debt in a company declared bankrupt by the commercial court is so that no more debate takes place first. Where the position between tax debt and labor debt is the same, namely as preferential creditors who have special rights which are equally protected by the repayment law. Especially with the issuance of the Constitutional Court's decision No.67 / PUU-XI / 2013 which places outstanding wages as a bill that must take precedence over all types of creditors including bills of separatist creditors, state rights bills, auction offices and government-formed public bodies. Of course this raises contradictions between laws and regulations, but if analyzed from the principle of justice, the wages of workers and other rights must be prioritized over repayment compared to the repayment of other creditors.

1518,1518,Artificial intelligence agents for crowd simulation in an immersive environment for emergency response,"Virtual crowds for non-combative environments play an important role in modern military operations and often create complications for the combatant forces involved. To address this problem, we are developing crowd simulation capable of generating crowds of non-combative civilians that exhibit a variety of individual and group behaviors at a different level of fidelity. Commercial game technology is used for creating an experimental setup to model an urban megacity environment and the physical behaviors of human characters that make up the crowd. The main objective of this work is to verify the feasibility of designing a collaborative virtual environment (CVE) and its usability for training security agents to respond to emergency situations like active shooter events, bomb blasts, fire and smoke. We present a hybrid (human-artificial) platform where experiments for disaster response can be performed in CVE by including AI agents and User-controlled agents. AI agents are computer controlled agents to include behaviors such as hostile agents, non-hostile agents, leader following agents, goal following agents, selfish agents, and fuzzy agents. User-controlled agents are autonomous agents for specific situation roles such as police officer, medic, firefighter, and swat official. The novelty of our work lies in modeling behaviors for AI agents or computer-controlled agents so that they can interact with user-controlled agents in an immersive training environment for emergency response and decision making.

1521,1521,A reliable data sharing protocol for increasing data availability in manet,"— Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is an indivisible part of wireless network where the nodes are placed randomly. Due to dynamic nature, data availability plays a major role which may degrade the network performance. Data availability defines number of replicated data to be shared between nodes to increase network efficiency. If network partition occurs, the data may not be accessed by the node which leads to network unavailability. In previous work, balancing of data availability and delay was focused. To overcome this issue, a Reliable Data Sharing Protocol (RDSP) is introduced to achieve high data availability and to balance energy efficiency. In first phase of the proposed protocol, neighbor routing is adopted to find reliable node. In second phase, data availability procedure is adopted in the network where the node consumes less energy to replicate the data.

1542,1542,ERL-Net: Entangled representation learning for single image de-raining,"Despite the significant progress achieved in image de-raining by training an encoder-decoder network within the image-to-image translation formulation, blurry results with missing details indicate the deficiency of the existing models. By interpreting the de-raining encoder-decoder network as a conditional generator, within which the decoder acts as a generator conditioned on the embedding learned by the encoder, the unsatisfactory output can be attributed to the low-quality embedding learned by the encoder. In this paper, we hypothesize that there exists an inherent mapping between the low-quality embedding to a latent optimal one, with which the generator (decoder) can produce much better results. To improve the de-raining results significantly over existing models, we propose to learn this mapping by formulating a residual learning branch, that is capable of adaptively adding residuals to the original low-quality embedding in a representation entanglement manner. Using an embedding learned this way, the decoder is able to generate much more satisfactory de-raining results with better detail recovery and rain artefacts removal, providing new state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets with considerable improvement (i.e., on the challenging Rain100H data, an improvement of 4.19dB on PSNR and 5% on SSIM is obtained).

1543,1543,Formal development and verification of quorum based static voting replica control protocol using event-b,"ⓒ 2019 SERSC.Modelling is imperative for the development of complex systems. Formal modelling of complex systems is a difficult task. Data replication improves availability of data in distributed environment on same time maintaining consistency is a challenging issue. Majority based replica control protocol is used to maintain consistency but if half of the sites are unavailable due to network partitioning or any failure reason, system will not proceed further. Quorum based static voting replica control protocol is one solution in which even half of the sites are not available but most promising sites on which the frequency of transaction is high are available then system allows to execute if quorum test succeeds. We are using formal methods to define the system using mathematical notations. Event-B is a formal method, which is based upon event driven approach. Event-B is used to develop a model in distributed environment. In this paper, we have done formal development and verification of quorum based static voting replica control protocol using Event-B.",60115426,Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology,Kanpur,India,['1700'],18.444444444444443,0.07289473684210525,0.45649122807017545,1

1546,1546,Multi-modal approach with deep embedded clustering for social image retrieval,"Multi-Modal Approach (MMA) was proposed for social image retrieval which provided relevant and diverse result set of images for user query. It returned a set of images based on the text and visual features related to the images. However, for large collection of images it is more difficult to identify the connection between text and visual feature descriptors in social media. So, an Improved MMA (IMMA) was proposed to know the relevance between text and visual feature descriptors using optimized AlexNet for social image retrieval. In order to design a robust, accurate and computationally efficient deep learning method for social image retrieval, an IMMA with deep clustering (MMA-DeepCluster) is proposed in this paper. In MMA-DeepCluster, a fully connected layer of optimized AlexNet is replaced with clustering layer where both text and visual feature descriptors are clustered. The cluster feature descriptors are used to classify the images as relevant and non-relevant images using an activation function. Then, the feature vectors of the relevant images are mapped into binary codes using binary function. Finally, a hamming distance between relevant image and database image is used to rank the images. The experiments are conducted in terms of precision, recall and accuracy to prove the effectiveness of the proposed MMA-DeepCluster approach.",60114470,Erode Arts and Science College,Erode,India,['1700'],20.7,0.07369614512471656,0.45374149659863955,1

Problems caused by the brake system of particle and humidity in wind turbines involve significant downtime and cost, including the costs of hiring the crew and equipment required for the replacement. A rotor brake of wind turbine is located adjacent to the gearboxes which are used to decrease the speed of wind turbine blade. In this paper, an experimental study of the drive train system of the turbine is conducted to look at the influence of environmental conditions on the mechanical brake system behaviors. The mechanical engineering behavior of the turbine brakes is studied. The influence of the silica sand particle size as found in the environment on the friction coefficient of turbine brakes is examined. The results show that the friction coefficient is increased with all turbine shaft speed. It is also found that by inserting humidity between the rotor and brake pads, the coefficient friction increased dramatically with increasing the wind turbine shaft speed from 200 rpm to 1000 rpm.",60018623,South Valley University,Qena,Egypt,['1700'],24.5,0.07222222222222222,0.45444444444444443,1

It is an indirect technique, in which the signals are analyzed for flaw characterization. Though various methods are cited in literature, probability of detection and sensitivity of detection are yet to be improved. Hence in this work, a novel flaw characterization technique is attempted by decomposing the ultrasonic signals into Walsh Hadamard transformed co-efficient and by determining statistical parameters. These parameters are then used for characterizing the defects. In order to improve the performance, a pseudorandom signal is also added to the ultrasonic signal and its performance is measured. It is found that Probability of Detection for the processed signals is better than that of unprocessed signals.

Having missing data in the data set affects the quality of the data set dramatically. In real-world databases and data warehouses, the data is inaccurate, incomplete and inconsistent. There can be numerous reasons behind this such as human or computer errors in the data entry procedure, purposefully submitting incorrect answers, faulty measurements, and many more. Missing data can have several negative effects on the knowledge discovery process such as biased results, invalid conclusions, and so on. Analyzing the data becomes an arduous task when there are missing data in the dataset. The main reason being, data mining algorithms primarily perform well on dataset that is consistent and complete. Luckily, this problem can be solved with the help of several techniques that can be employed in the data preprocessing stage to handle missing data.

The complexity of learning classes for a single object associated with multiple term sets is a key issue for multi-term data sets. Existing methods learn based on the feature discrimination observed for similar term sets, but the discrimination measures the deviation of class values rather than associations. Such a method may not be suitable for classification, because each term contains a specific feature. This paper proposes a Multi-Term Association (MTA) Approach that uses term features to describe and use association rules to discover term correlations for data classification. The MTA aims to find accurate classes for data objects using a ""knowledge class"" structure that suggests binary associations between them to build terminology patterns to handle multi-term database classification. A comprehensive experimental analysis was performed on a set of MULAN datasets to verify the efficiency of MTA relative to other recent classifiers.

We ran a pilot study on blindfolded sighted adults (n=5) to test the extent to which users can locate objects' spatial positions after short training with the Topo-Speech, as well as their ability to locate untrained spatial positions. Participants were trained for ~30 minutes on the detection of objects' positions on a 3×3 grid. Then they were tested on the same spatial locations (though using different stimuli). Finally, participants were tested on identifying the positions of objects on a 5×5 grid (i.e. additional spatial locations) without any specific training. Our results showed that participants performed significantly above chance for both trained and untrained spatial positions.

A cross-sectional online survey that included the Assessing Determinants of Prospective Take-up of Virtual Reality (version 2; ADOPT-VR2) Instrument was conducted in 2014-2015 (Canada) and replicated in 2017-2018 (US). Recruitment took place via convenience and snowball sampling, using email, social media and newsletter postings. Therapists in the US reported greater past experience with, current use of, and intention to use VR/AVGs than did those in Canada. They also rated facilitators more positively and barriers less negatively. Use of customized VR systems was low, with specific system prevalence differing between countries. The most frequently used AVG systems, populations and settings of use, functional goals, predictors of use, learning needs and preferred forms of support were similar between countries. These similarities support the generalizability of educational interventions for both countries. Materials to be developed will focus on non-customized AVG systems. Subsequent work will examine how uptake relates to country-specific health care funding and policies, probe differences in learning needs between therapists with experience using customized versus non-customized VR/AVG systems, and extend the survey to other countries where VR/AVG use is prevalent.",60028628,Northeastern University,Boston,United States,['1705'],22.545454545454547,0.07428030303030304,0.3160822510822511,1

The task constituted of crossing a canyon along a slack-rope, positioned at three different heights (2,50 & 100 meters above a river) and in three velocities (slow, medium & fast). Time (s) of crossing of the canyon was measured as the outcome measure. The results show that the time was directly dependent upon the height of the rope above the river, i.e., the higher the rope, the slower the time, in the fast (F(2,18)=5.24, p=0.016) and in the slow (F(2,18)=8.469, p=0.003) velocities. However, subjectively, all participants reported they felt no difference in their own performance in the different heights. Thus, this gap between the objective performance and the subjective perception of performance may indicate a height-time trade-off in performing a virtual balance task.",60080064,Ariel University,Ariel,Israel,['1705'],23.666666666666668,0.060714285714285714,0.41428571428571426,1
1601,1601,Feature space selection for cyber-physical system based on improved feature space partitioning tree,"Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a new generation of the digital systems based on dynamic interdependencies and convergence between the physical world and cyberspace. There are various data mining techniques are used to handle the data in CPS. A novel deep learning inference runtime called DeepRT was designed to support predictable inference performance both spatially and temporally. It comprised of two main processes like feature pre-processing system and deep learning system. In the feature preprocessing system, data collected from the mobile devices and sensors were unwrapped. Then, the feature elements were used as the input of the deep learning engine which classifies the input data and infers results. Nevertheless, the feature scope which has insufficient training data usually has a much higher error rate. Hence, the performance of DeepRT is degraded due to feature space lacking. So in this paper, Improved Feature Space Partitioning Tree with DeepRT (IFSPT-DeepRT) is proposed to decrease the feature scope lacks in the training data. Initially, IFSPT-DeepRT splits the feature space into number of partitions using classification and regression tree (CART) which constructs a tree for feature partitioning. Also, a new splitting criterion called weighted gain in Gini index is introduced for selecting the splitting points in the tree. The feature space partition is evaluated using Shapley Feature Importance (SFI) measure and selects the feature space partition which has high SFI value. It is given as input to the DeepRT to classify the input data and infer results.",60114470,Erode Arts and Science College,Erode,India,['1700'],18.615384615384617,0.01714962121212121,0.33855925324675323,1
1602,1602,The taxonomy of indonesian criminal offense in proving the corporate criminal liability,"The development of technology, business models, and the varied income streams which are influenced by the human behaviour changes and the dynamics of social processes have created a diversification of new types of crimes that committed by corporations which called by corporate crime. The attention to the importance of criminal responsibility for corporate crime appeared because this type of crime was capable of causing greater damage than the individual crimes with conventional crime typologies. Moreover, unlike the individual crimes, not all of the corporate crimes can be easily criminalized. Criminal liability is more difficult to prove when the motives and intentions of a crime cannot be attributed to the corporation even though the harm caused are very broad. This article aims to provide recommendations to the taxonomy model of Indonesia's corporate criminal liability. The classification process is chosen as a method to generalize corporate actions that can be imposed by the corporation. This classification uses data analysis techniques that use abstraction and legal interpretation in qualitative normative research. The results of this study are expected to be able to assist in the preparation of taxonomy models of criminal acts so that all corporate criminal cases brought by the Public Prosecutor to the Court will have a proper basis that can be criminally responsible in accordance with corporate characteristics.",113128777,University of Sebelas Maret,Surakarta,Indonesia,['1700'],27.25,0.0013807720057720037,0.33698683261183265,1
1603,1603,Saliency map based multi-view rendering for autostereoscopic displays,"With the provision of motion parallax and viewing convenience, multi-view autostereoscopic displays have been popular in recent years. Obviously, increasing the number of views improves the quality of 3D images/videos and produces to better motion parallax. The tradeoff is the larger number of view images required to generate in real time leading to the need of the huge amount of computing resources for the systems. In fact, people often focuses on the distinctive objects in a scene. For achieving the same level of motion parallax, it can use more views to present distinctive objects and less views for the rest. As a result, fewer computing resources are required for rendering multi-view images. With exploiting this principle, a new multi-view rendering scheme based on visual saliency is proposed for the application of autostereoscopic displays. The new method uses saliency maps to extract distinctive regions with different saliency level in a scene and dynamically control the number of views to generate for them. Points in the distinctive regions with high saliency use more views, while points in the regions with low saliency use less views. By controlling the number of views in use for different salient regions, the proposed scheme can maintain low computation complexity without causing significant degradation in 3D experience. In this paper, a 2D+Z format based multi-view rendering system with the use of saliency maps is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the new scheme. Subjective assessment results demonstrate that the saliency map based multi-view system has slight degradation in 3D performance compared with true 28-view system and achieves 55% reduction in computation complexity.",60103941,Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute,Hong Kong,China,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",22.083333333333332,0.1397636363636364,0.4201454545454545,1

1624,1624,"Head Mounted Display Application for Contextual Sensory Integration Training: Design, Implementation, Challenges and Patient Outcomes","Patients with vestibular disorders display difficulty with multisensory integration and complain of dizziness and imbalance in busy and complex visual environments. Patients who experience symptoms or a fall within a certain environment are likely to develop fear of that situation. It has been suggested that multisensory integration should be addressed in conditions as close as possible to real-life situations, but these are often challenging to replicate in the clinical setting. Virtual reality (VR) can provide a non-threatening method for patients to practice multisensory integration in a functional context. Advances in technology make Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) accessible and affordable in the clinic. We developed a VR HMD application that allows patients to practice contextual sensory integration (C.S.I) while sitting, standing, turning or stepping within diverse scenes. This application can become an integral part of vestibular rehabilitation. For successful implementation, usability is critical. In this pilot, usability and preliminary outcomes were tested in a mixed-methods descriptive study.

1625,1625,The impact of organizational factors on strategic management practices of firms in jordan,"Strategic Management (STM) has the ultimate goal of establishing, evaluating, developing and maintaining the organization's position in its markets and activities. This includes extensive knowledge, full awareness, capabilities, assimilation and analysis, and this extends to all aspects of the organization in the environment in which it operates and its community. According to Jordanian businesses, there is a lack of research on how to identify regulatory factors for the successful implementation of STM practices. Consequently, the purpose of this paper was to identify factors affecting STM among companies in Jordan. To achieve this goal, the paper uses empirical data from 261 trading companies in Jordan. 151 valid questionnaires for main study after uncompleted items in their questionnaires were excluded. A structured questionnaire was prepared for data collection. The results showed that regulatory factors in Jordan have a positive and significant impact on STM practices. Moreover, organizational cultures may be another reliable factor to rely on research findings that have shown that most participants strongly agreed that organizational cultures do indeed affect the effectiveness of strategic management.

1628,1628,"Multi-touch-based assessment of hand mobility, dexterity and function. Preliminary study of validity, reliability and sensitivity to upper limb impairment severity in individuals with stroke","Impairments of the upper limb function are among the most common and disabling sequelae after stroke, and their rehabilitation poses a major challenge for current physical and occupational therapy interventions. While restoration of certain degree of proximal and global movements and function is expected, the recovery of premorbid hand mobility and dexterity is less likely to occur. Although great efforts are usually made to rehabilitate these skills, with customized particular and analytic exercises, their assessment is rarely made with the same level of specificity. In general, hand and finger mobility and functionality are indirectly assessed in the clinic with standardized clinical scales and tests that require the use of these skills to perform some tasks. Although these scales are easy to administer, they can present poor accuracy, be biased, and do not allow for isolated assessment of joints and movements. Multi-touch technology enables interaction with electronic devices, such as smartphones and tablets, with on-screen finger touches. Although there is a very limited number of studies that investigate the potential of this technology to rehabilitate hand mobility and dexterity, the use of this technology for assessment of these skills remains unexplored. This study evaluates the feasibility of a multi-touch-based assessment tool (app) of hand mobility and dexterity in a sample of post-stroke survivors. Our results provide preliminary evidence that this technology can be used to design valid and reliable instruments for assessing hand mobility and dexterity that, in addition, are sensitive to the severity of the motor impairment of the upper limb after stroke, which could complement conventional clinical assessment.",60011476,Universitat Politècnica de València,Valencia,Spain,['1705'],28.77777777777778,0.04516941391941392,0.43521062271062266,1

1635,1635,Is the room moving? Muscle responses following visual perturbations,"Postural adjustments are essential for balance control and to reduce risk of falling. One emerging method to train reactive postural control consists in exposing individuals to safe and controlled destabilizing perturbations that intend to simulate changing conditions that can lead to falls. Studies using virtual reality suggest that visual perturbations engage mechanisms of motor adaptation, increase electrocortical activity and modulate balance performance. What is not yet clear is the impact of trunk and limb muscles activation on the postural adjustments responsible to maintain balance control. This paper aims to map the response of trunk and limb muscles to visual perturbations, and compare them to those of physical perturbations. Additionally, our study includes vertical perturbations (i.e. balance disturbances in the vertical plane) known to be a major cause of falling. Therefore, this paper also compares muscles responses to both horizontal and vertical perturbations. Fourteen healthy participants (ten males; age: 27±4; BMI: 23.8±2.6 kg/m2) stood on a moveable platform within a virtual reality system projecting visual scenes over a 360° dome-shaped screen such that the participant appeared to be standing in the middle of a room. Concomitantly, the electrical activity of tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, rectus femoris, hamstring, rectus abdominis, paraspinal, external oblique and deltoid muscles was captured. Amid a larger protocol, this paper reports on randomly presented 1) visual perturbations; i.e. the virtual room moves during 0.35 seconds a distance corresponding to 14 cm in four directions (forward - FP, backward - BP, upward - UP, downward - DP), each repeated three times; and 2) physical perturbations (12cm displacement in one second) for the four directions and two sensory conditions: static camera (SC; virtual room remains static) and dynamic camera (DC; corresponding transitions in the visual scenery). We calculated three muscle activation parameters: onset latency, duration of activation, and magnitude. Separate 2-factor repeated-measures ANOVA were applied for each outcome measure across factors of perturbation direction (FP, BP, UP and DP) and condition (VIS, SC, DC). Forward visual perturbations led to longer onset latencies when compared to upward and downward visual perturbations (e.g. in the gastrocnemius: respectively, 443±56.6 ms vs. 326±39.6 ms and 334±51.1 ms, P<0.05). Duration of activation was longer following downward visual perturbations than after backward visual perturbations in the rectus femoris (respectively, 630±120 ms vs 335±81.2 ms, P<0.05). All lower limbs and the paraspinal muscles presented with a longer onset latency in response to visual perturbations in comparison to both types of physical perturbations (SC and DC) (P<0.05). The magnitude of activation following visual perturbations was smaller than both types of physical perturbations in all muscles (P<0.05). Duration of activation was also longer in the gastrocnemius following visual perturbations when compared to both SC and DC conditions of physical perturbations (P<0.05). Overall, magnitude of responses was often larger following horizontal perturbations in comparison to vertical perturbations. Our results suggest that visual perturbations alone activate limb and trunk muscles. Although perturbation direction seems to regulate the timing of response following visual perturbations in some limbs muscles, no differences were observed in the magnitude of activation within visual perturbations. Physical perturbations significantly increased EMG responses compared with visual perturbations. Overall, horizontal perturbations often led to faster and more intense responses than vertical perturbations. Our findings that different types of perturbations lead to more or less intense muscle responses and to different activation timing may have translational benefits for the optimization of rehabilitation strategies implementing destabilizing perturbations and oriented to persons at risk of falling.",60011766,Chaim Sheba Medical Center Israel,Tel Aviv-Yafo,Israel,['1705'],21.185185185185187,0.06089181286549708,0.24559314954051792,1

At the same time, the research about spectrum utilization shows that the usage is not efficient creating unutilized portions called as white spaces. The Cognitive Radio (CR) technology enables nodes to use unutilized portions of the spectrum for communications causing increase in the efficiency of spectrum usage. But in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) the design of protocols at various layers of the protocol stack is tedious. At network layer, routing of packets from source to destination is difficult and challenging as compared with normal wireless networks. Use of clustering in CRNs shows better network-wide performance. It increases stability of route, helps in route discovery and maintenance, rediscovery of route in case of link failure. It also causes reduction in routing overhead. This paper introduces a routing protocol for CRNs called Cluster based Cognitive Radio Routing Mechanism with Link Stability (C2R2M-LS).

1646,1646,Creating high fidelity 360° virtual reality with high dynamic range spherical panorama images," English language.This research explores the development of a novel method and apparatus for creating spherical panoramas enhanced with high dynamic range (HDR) for high fidelity Virtual Reality 360 degree (VR360) user experiences. A VR360 interactive panorama presentation using spherical panoramas can provide virtual interactivity and wider viewing coverage; with three degrees of freedom, users can look around in multiple directions within the VR360 experiences, gaining the sense of being in control of their own engagement. This degree of freedom is facilitated by the use of mobile displays or head-mount-devices. However, in terms of image reproduction, the exposure range can be a major difficulty in reproducing a high contrast real-world scene. Imaging variables caused by difficulties and obstacles can occur during the production process of spherical panorama facilitated with HDR. This may result in inaccurate image reproduction for location-based subjects, which will in turn result in a poor VR360 user experience.

The dominance of the monoistic approach in law enforcement to hate speech has been criticized for being very vulnerable to abuse. A monoistic approach that emphasizes the fulfillment of elements of offense must be evaluated because the main subject that is tested or tried in a hate speech case is speech or words. Speeches or words can have multiple meanings, therefore, to ascertain whether the perpetrator of hate speech really intends or intentionally disseminates information that can cause hatred based on Tribe, Religion, Race and Intergroup (SARA), the inner attitude of the perpetrator when delivering the utterance must be taken into account. The dualistic approach is important in order to portray clearly whether the elements of offense are fulfilled and the action of the perpetrator can be accounted for legally.

And also, MANETs are more susceptible to attacks due to its infrastructure less and dynamic nature. That is, the networks are not having centralized management and monitoring point. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) give auditing and monitoring abilities to the network that can provide local security to each node and also provides way to attain determined hopes on other nodes. Enhancement of the prior works on anomaly detection, Integrated Clustering Based Intrusion Detection Model (ID-IDM) combines the clustering procedure of networking with the IDS working structure to detect the intrusions with minimal computational overhead and minimal power consumptions. On considering that the nodes in MANET are power and battery constrained, an honest monitoring node must be avail to monitor and response against the intrusions periodically. For that, a novel procedure is also incorporated for evaluating the Node Honesty Rates (NHR) in the network. The nodes within the clusters are needed to monitor the overall network operations and additionally, node revocation procedure has also been included for the better performance of the proposed model. Integrated clustering is involved in detecting intrusions collectively since a single node in the network can neither perceive the attacks by the malicious node alone nor the malicious node has been revoked from the network. Hence, the IC-IDM results in précised intrusion detection with low processing and memory overhead irrespective of network traffic and nodes mobility. The performance of the affirmed model is validated using NS2 simulations based on clustering overhead, packet delivery ratio, energy utilization and power consumption.",60013041,Bharathiar University,Coimbatore,India,['1700'],24.90909090909091,0.13816137566137565,0.39570105820105816,1

The particle number and size distribution are crucial metrics for toxicological analysis and aerosol-cloud interactions. The modern aircraft engines are characterized by decreasing levels of mass emissions of particulate matter, leading to little contribution to the mass concentration. However, the abundant ultrafine particles in the aviation exhaust with diameters less than 100 nm may significantly increase the particle number concentration (PNC). Here we will introduce our recent studies on utilizing the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) from OpenSky network to develop the black carbon (BC) particle number emission inventory for global civil aviation and to investigate the influences of aviation emissions on the particle number concentration near Zurich airport. The developed inventory indicated that the BC particle number emission was approximately (10.9±2.1)×1025 per year with an average emission index of (6.06±1.18)×1014 per kg of burned fuel, which was about 1.3% of the total ground anthropogenic emissions, and 3.6% of the road transport emission.

The annual mean contributions of the Zurich airport to the particle number concentrations ranged from about 105 cm-3 at the airport entrance to about 103 cm-3 at ETH Honggerberg (about 6 km away). There were about 1000 hours per year for the investigated locations to have more than 1000 cm-3 from the airport, with medians of about 104 cm-3. The OpenSky network ADS-B database provides a new opportunity to estimate the aviation emission using the detailed flight trajectory data.

1686,1686,Dynamic multi-view autostereoscopy," It is obvious that increasing the number of views improves the quality of 3D images/videos and leads to better motion parallax. However, it requires huge amount of computing resources to generate large numbers of view images in real time. In principle, objects appearing near the screen plane have very small absolute disparity. It can use fewer views to present these objects for achieving the same level of motion parallax. The concept of dynamic multi-view autostereoscopy is to dynamically control the number of views to generate for the points in 3D space based on their disparity. Points with larger absolute disparity use more views, while points with smaller absolute disparity use fewer views. As a result, fewer computing resources are required for real-time generation of view images. Subjective assessments show that only slight degradation in 3D experience is resulted on its realization over 2D plus depth based multi-view autostereoscopic display. However, the amount of computation for generating view images can be reduced by about 44.3% when 3D scenes are divided into three spaces.",60103941,Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute,Hong Kong,China,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",19.22222222222222,0.1123677248677249,0.511494708994709,0

Our method is based on query rewriting, a well-known technique for ontology-based query answering (OBQA), where the knowledge provided by the ontology is compiled into the query so that the rewritten query can be evaluated directly over a database. This technique reduces the problem of query answering w.r.t. an ontology to query evaluation over a database instance. Specifically, we consider members of the DL-Lite family extended with unary and binary concrete domain predicates over the real numbers. While approaches for query rewriting DL-Lite with these concrete domain have been investigated theoretically, these approaches use a combined approach in which also the data is processed, and require the concrete domain values occurring in the data to be known in advance, which makes the procedure data-dependent.

This model is done in three stages, namely reducing data, presenting data and conclusions. In order to establish an election law system which in this study focused on the Presidential Election, it is necessary to reconstruct the dispute resolution of the Presidential Election results with a progressive legal approach. Referring to the progressive legal paradigm regarding the existence of structured, systematic and massive presidential election violations, the approach that must be taken is to ensure that there is a causal relationship between violations that are not merely administrative, but there are also fraudulent actions that make them more dominant. The occurrence of Presidential Election violations, both the procedure, the process and the mechanism carried out by TSM at all stages of the Election, more pointed to the dominant position of one candidate (Paslon).

1700,1700,Antecedents of brand personality,"People who treat their car, computer or dog as a friend or a member of family can be found easily in everyday life. In the same vein consumers tend to humanise brands too.Managing brands play a pivotal role in the company’s marketing strategy. In particular the brand personality concept represents a strategic tool allowing the establishment of strong brands. Despite the importance of and the increased attention to the concept of brand personality, limited research has been conducted to identify the antecedents of brand personality. The various brand personality dimensions differ in their nature and are perceived by consumers from different causes. Thus, knowing which antecedents effectively influence a brand personality is necessary in order to manage a brand’s personality. To fill this research gap a research model was developed with the constructs hedonic perception, utilitarian perception, brand personality dimensions sincerity and excitement, cognitive branding outcomes and emotional branding outcomes and the model was tested in this paper. This paper explored customer perception of brand personality in the two wheeler industry. By developing a conceptual model, this article contributed to the theoretical advancement of the concept.

1701,1701,Feasibility study of conversion of coal into synfuel,"India is the third largest consumer of crude oil in the world, after the United States and China. India accounted 4.8% of total world oil consumption in 2016-17. The estimated total consumption of crude oil in India rose from 156.1 million tons in 2007-08 to 245.4 million tons in 2016-17 . Petroleum oil consumption in India is ever increasing at an average rate of 8% per annum in the past five years. With inadequate crude oil reserves, India is heavily dependent on imports. The problem of the rising cost of fuel and consumption are obstacle for country’s development due to outflow of money resulting in trade deficit adversely affecting Rupee exchange rate for $. Nevertheless, India ranks 2nd in the coal production after it surpassed USA and Russia in terms of volume and 4th in terms of Energy ( tons of crude oil equivalent) due to high ash content in the Indian coal in the range of 8-17% by weight. Further, India has huge reserves of coal which is sufficient for 400 years consumption. Dwindling oil reserves in the world and abundance of coal necessitates synthetic oil which can be used in Engines. This paper focuses on the feasibility of conversion of coal to synthetic fuel, production methods and utilization as an alternative fuel. The economics of synthetic fuel is compared to the petroleum products produced from crude oil. The feasibility method compared are Karrick and Fischer-Tropsch. Karrick process is an hydrogenisation process of coal at high pressure and high temperature for direct production of synthetic fuel without gasification stage. In Fischer Tropsch process coal is fully gasified after mixing with steam to form Gas. This Synthetic Gas is further processed to produce synthetic fuel known as Synfuel. The paper also deals with the suitability of these technologies to Indian conditions. The final conclusion based on the above analysis is that, based on the energy content, Coal is suitable for conversion to synfuel using both the processes. The tendency of many oil companies investing billions of dollars in the synthetic oil projects indicates that the Synfuel option is inevitable in the future since the existing automobile and aviation sectors with their infra-structure can be used as it is without any modification compared to the option of bi-fuel and flexible fuel vehicle / hybrid options which call for a significant amount of additional investment by the end user.",60114613,Sreenivasa Institute of Technology and Management Studies,Chittoor,India,['1700'],22.055555555555557,-0.04637931034482755,0.6075862068965516,1

1724,1724,A non-linear kernel feature subset selection based semi-supervised framework for medical disease prediction,"As the size of the medical datasets increases, the prediction of disease patterns also increases in biomedical applications in the high dimensional features. Micro-array data play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the various diseases. Many existing methods are not applicable to the prediction of disease without identified genes and semi-supervised learning. Meanwhile, several other approaches have struggled to prioritize associations for all diseases at the same time. Therefore, the development of an algorithm that can identify reliable candidates for disease using existing gene-disease associations verified by the biological experiment is essential to solve these problems effectively. To overcome these problems, a semi-supervised learning model based on nonlinear feature selection is proposed to overcome the problem of prediction of disease. The wrapperbased hybrid correlation approach is used to partition the space of the function into k-related features. Ultimately, the deep neural network architecture was designed and implemented to enhance the prediction of disease on datasets of large dimensions. Experimental results have shown that the current model is more reliable compared to existing models in terms of true positivity and receiver operating characteristics (ROC).",60017411,Acharya Nagarjuna University,Guntur,India,['1700'],20.444444444444443,0.15731092436974792,0.4584453781512606,1

Authentication and encryption are basic procedures to ensure secure communications over a public network due to tamper-resistance and convenience in dealing with a password file. Most of the used protocols; HTTP, FTP, and SMTP of the Internet applications use text stream that is more and more vulnerable to attacks. Encryption represents the main security for the most computer applications. This work proposes enhanced secure actions for transferring data using FTP protocol by using a smart token. A smart token has the capabilities of the smart card, but more secured beside some interesting operations. A practical and secure user scheme, based on a smart token device, is proposed. A Secure Platform has been developed using implemented APIs and PKCS#11 as RSA standard interface. The proposed API is called SAFEST (Secure Actions for FTP Environment with Smart Token). SAFEST API wraps a standard protocol for implementing the communication between a token and the application using it. This API is a platform independent, scalable to support more functionality, optimizing token usage and adding more security for accessing token objects. The smart token can process the cryptographic key operations on its own rather than on the host computer, which supports high-level platform independence.

1748,1748,A virtual scribe system using convolutional neural network to aid the physically challenged,"Around the world 30% of the people are suffering from various disabilities, many of them are physically and visually impaired. Such physically and visually challenged students often require a scribe to assist them during exams and also finding a scribe is a tedious task. Speech recognition technology is one of the emerging and fastest growing engineering technologies. It has become an integral part of our lives nowadays in many forms like Voice based assistants, Navigation, Searches, and education. Speech recognition system can be used as a replacement for scribes. Though the most commonly available speech recognition systems like Ok Google, Siri has very good accuracy for general speech, they are not suitable in domain-specific applications like recognizing chemical equations. So the aim is to develop an automatic speech recognition system for chemical equations in order to make the examination process easier for the physically challenged. This system uses a conventional neural network to recognize speech. It takes a speech signal recorded using a microphone containing chemical equation and converts it into text in real time. Additionally, this system can also be used for similar tasks like voice-based dialing, voice-based data entry and documentation.

1770,1770,Vat to the future: Extrapolating visual complex event processing," All rights reserved.A key technology to analyze high volume spatio-temporal data streams is complex event processing (CEP). CEP is unique in its ability to not only continuously process data as it arrives through common operations such as aggregations, but also to support pattern matching queries. Pattern Matching allows to detect a user-defined sequence of temporal predicates on event streams. The high volume flight data as provided by the OpenSky Network has a lot of characteristics that make it a perfect match for CEP. In particular, pattern matching operators can be utilized to detect a plethora of movement (landing, starting, evasion) and group patterns (airplanes closing in on each other) in a timely manner. However, CEP queries can be complex in nature and may require a combination of domain expertise and historical data analysis in order to deliver the desired results. In order to address these issues, we have combined a database-backed CEP system (Chroni-cleDB) with a scientific toolbox for interactive data exploration and geo visualization (Vat System). This allows users to interactively execute CEP queries and visually confirm the validity of their results, thus, simplifying the parameter tuning considerably. In addition, our solution supports efficient and interactive time travel queries. It allows to combine event streams with additional data sources (e.g., remote sensing images) and processing technologies (e.g., machine learning models) to extract higher level knowledge. Finally, our ongoing work on visual analytics explores extrapolating query results to provide more timely feedback for critical situations and multi-query optimization techniques to allow for an even more efficient system in general.",60012556,Philipps-Universität Marburg,Marburg,Germany,['1700'],23.636363636363637,0.08902777777777778,0.5057638888888888,0

1776,1776,An agricultural-related information elements and provision for agripreneurship one-stop information portal,"Unemployment and job creation is one of the big issues after student graduation. Agriculture is one of the main sectors that provides employment and job opportunities for graduates in many countries over the world. In Malaysia, one of the government initiatives is the Agricultural NKEA of Malaysia’s ETP that put emphasis on the agri-based entrepreneurship in aquaculture, organic farming, seaweed farming, herbal products, fruits and vegetables and premium processed food. On top of firm physical infrastructures and monetary aids in operating those initiatives, information management plays its role by the provision of integrated information services composing all critical aspects of agricultural-based agripreneurship. However, an initial scrutiny on agricultural-centric web portals provided by government’s agricultural-related departments and agencies indicated that agricultural information resources, services and products are isolated and scattered. This circumstance may strain potential entrance to explore opportunities and employment in agricultural-based business or agripreneurship. Subsequently, this paper reports the examination of relevant and critical online information resources and services provided and available from governments’ agricultural-related departments and agencies. The potential outcome of the proposed study partly presented in this paper is the identification of the uniformed, integrated, and critical agripreneurship information resources, services and products into a framework of online agripreneurship one-stop information portal retrievable by potential agropreneurs for know-what, know-when, know-why, know-who, know-where and know-how pertaining to the agripreneurship.",60004351,Universiti Teknologi MARA,Shah Alam,Malaysia,['1700'],27.625,0.11041666666666666,0.5453869047619048,1

To verify that the movements practiced in virtual reality applications are similar to the movements to be retrained when performing everyday activities, it is important to understand if movements performed in a virtual and a physical environment (real-life) are similar. The aim of this study is to estimate the extent to which unilateral reach to grasp movements performed in a 2D low-cost virtual environment are kinematically similar to movements performed in a comparable physical environment in healthy individuals. Using a cross-sectional design, 12 right-handed, healthy participants performed reaching to grasp movements with the dominant arm in a low cost 2D virtual and a comparable physical environment. Each movement was repeated 20 times in each environment. Arm and trunk kinematics were recorded using the Optotrak motion analysis system (13 markers; 120 Hz) and 3D kinematics were reconstructed. Temporal and spatial characteristics of the endpoint trajectory and arm and trunk movement patterns were compared between environments using ANOVAs. In the virtual environment, movements were slower, more segmented and the endpoint trajectory was straighter. Ranges of motion of arm and trunk movements did not differ between environments. When using 2D virtual environments for upper limb rehabilitation, differences in movement performance between virtual and physical environments should be taken into account.",60002494,McGill University,Montreal,Canada,['1705'],22.2,0.075,0.3982142857142858,1

Blockchain is a kind of an appropriated database that is utilized to repeat, share, and synchronize information spread crosswise over various geological areas, for example, different destinations, nations, or associations. The primary property of blockchain is that there is no focal director or brought together information stockpiling system. Agreement calculations administer the peerto-peer decentralized system. Various advantages and uses of blockchains have brought about it getting well known among an expansive range of organizations, yet is it the case in the development business? Given, the regressive idea of the development business in digitalisation and its hesitance to transform it gets imperative to dissect the potential effect of Blockchains as a potential troublesome innovation. In spite of the fact that there exists a critical research hole and the potential probability to test blockchain in the development area, the development business is generally announced as the second most reduced part to have embraced data innovation.

Many VEs feature complex audiovisuals designed to motivate and engage children in repetitive use; however, the value of these enhancements remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a simple versus a complex VE on motor learning of a novel balance task in typically developing (TD) children and children with cerebral palsy (CP). In addition, we explored the relationship between children's motivation, engagement and their motor learning outcomes in each VE. Twenty-seven TD children and 6 children with hemiplegic or diplegic CP participated. Participants were randomized to practice the same novel postural control task in either a simple or a complex flat-screen display VE. Motor learning was measured by an error metric per trial. Following 40 acquisition trials, children completed motivation (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory) and engagement (User Engagement Scale) measures. They returned 2-7 days later for retention and transfer tests. Children with CP had significantly greater performance errors as compared to TD children at all sessions; however, there was no difference in performance between simple and complex VE conditions at any session, nor were there any differences in engagement or motivation between conditions or groups. Lower self-reported motivation was associated with greater performance error at retention and transfer in all participants.

They have been characterized as well for their potential promotion of physical activity (PA). Games may be designed specifically for rehabilitation, or adapted from their intended recreational use for serious application such as rehabilitation or promotion of PA. A major limitation of the commercially available games is their lack of customization of movement parameters and inability to record performance metrics that are useful for practice. They are however, considered engaging and may promote high intensity of therapy (repetitions and physiologic correlates). This study compared the performance of persons in the chronic phase post-stroke playing a custom rehabilitation game to a comparable recreational active video game. The goal of the study was to determine, which game promoted greater exercise intensity and which was more enjoyable and less effortful. Fifteen participants in the chronic phase post-stroke were studied. The recreational game was played at a significantly higher intensity, both for repetitions, and energy expenditure while the experience of playing the custom game was reported as more enjoyable and less effortful. Further, movement accuracy was greater during custom game play. While intensity for metabolic equivalents (METs) and % of maximum heart rate were significantly greater when the recreational game was played, both games were played in the same intensity band to promote moderate activity.

Numerous models for affinity prediction have been developed through machine learning and deep learning. The basic deep neural network architecture uses a linear stack of layers and sharing of layers is not feasible whereas the functional deep neural network uses sharing of layers but the models are affected, when there is a change in layer. Hence complex models cannot be constructed and cannot predict binding affinity efficiently. This problem can be overcome by customizing the layers in deep neural network architecture. In this research work, the network layers are defined by sharing features with several layers and weights are trained and updated for every iteration to obtain accurate prediction. The work is implemented with 626 protein structures for protein-protein interaction and 313 complexes are attained from the protein-protein interaction. Binding site is identified by passing the 3D protein structures into convolutional neural network. Features like energy calculations, physio-chemical properties and interfacial and non-interfacial properties are extracted from interacted complex for building the model. Feature representations are learned automatically by deep learning through trainable weights in customized layers.

However, natural fibres and polymer is chemically incompatibility. So, in order to enhance the interfacial bonding between the kenaf fibre and PP, NWKFM was chemically treated using 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was used to determine the chemical structural and functional groups in both treated and untreated NWKF. The mechanical and physical testing for both untreated and treated non-woven kenaf fibre mat filled PP (NWKFPP) composites were conducted. Overall, the result shows that, 3% MAPP-treated NWKFPP demonstrated the optimum performance in mechanical and water absorption properties compared to others amount of MAPP. Thus, the addition of MAPP as coupling agent in NWKFPP enhances the fibre-matrix adhesion, which is also contributed to the increasing of mechanical and physical properties of NWKFP.",60090705,Universiti Malaysia Kelantan,Pengkalan Chepa,Malaysia,['1700'],21.571428571428573,0.20714285714285713,0.4765306122448979,1

One of the difficulties in deep learning-based malware detection and classification tasks is lacking of training malware samples. With insufficient training data the classification performance of the deep model could be compromised significantly. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a method which uses the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic malware samples. Our experiment results show that by using the DCGAN generated adversarial synthetic malware samples, the classification accuracy of the classifier - a 18-layer deep residual network is significantly improved by approximately 6%.",60007652,Old Dominion University,Norfolk,United States,"['1712', '1706']",26.0,0.13512396694214876,0.5549586776859504,1

The validity is verified through comparison of the proposed method and FEM. Methods/Statistical analysis: The basic model was selected for the IPMSM with an output of 15 kW. The bridge reluctance is assumed to be 2T, ignoring the leakage reluctance of the basic model and the rotor and stator reluctance.The barrier form is finally derived using a equivalent magnetic circuitfor complementing and improving the gap flux density. Findings:Equivalent magnetic circuit is applied to IPMSM. The equivalent magnetic circuit shows the average of the relative permeability verified by FEM, the relative permeability of the saturated part of the barrier and the value of the stator relative permeability, the leakage magnetic resistance, the rotor magnetic resistance and the stator The assumption is made that magnetic resistance is ignored. In addition, assuming that the flux density of the barrier is 2T, an error occurs between the FEM and the equivalent magnetic circuit. As a result of confirming the equivalent magnetic circuit, the gap flux density is increased by increasing the length of the barrier. Comparing the characteristics of the basic model with the final model complemented by the equivalent magnetic circuit, it can be seen that the torque ripple decreases and the torque increases as the air gap flux density increases. Improvements/Applications: The air gap flux density is compared with FEM through a equivalent magnetic circuit to derive an improved the air gap flux density through the equivalent magnetic circuit.",60068689,Hanbat National University,Yusong,South Korea,['1700'],25.4,-0.016666666666666666,0.30833333333333335,1

This is focused and handled in the previous work via using the technique called Interference Reduction aware Optimal Routing Scheme (IRORS). However this work doesn’t focus on intermediate path breakages which might affect the successful data transmission. Path breakage prediction during run time is more difficult where the uninterrupted data transmission is more complex. This is handled in the proposed work through enhancing the technique called as Route Breakage concerned Non-Interference Multipath Routing Protocol (RB-NIMRP). In this work, reliable faster data transmission is guaranteed by introducing the non interfering multi path selection method. Through this multiple route paths data transmission will be performed. And then these route paths will be monitored dynamically in terms of their individual nodes resources. In terms of lacking resources immediately rerouting will be done before path failure. Here monitoring node is responsible for finding the node failures which should be selected more optimally. This is done with the help of dynamic monitor node selection process.

The present study focuses on kinematic and dynamic adaptation and post-adaptation effects of lower limb segment coordination, during and after a 15 N tensile force exposure by presenting two representations of 3D coordination - planar and phase diagrams. One chronic stroke subject (73 y.o., 8 months post-stroke, RH) and one age-matched control subject (71 y.o, RH) walked on a self-paced treadmill in a virtual environment holding a robot-controlled haptic leash. The paradigm consisted of a 30 s pre-force baseline epoch, followed by a 60 s tensile force and a 60 s post-force epoch. Both the chronic stroke and control subject showed evidence of changes in bilateral intersegmental coordination of the lower limb to accompany gait speed increases during force and post-force epochs. In particular, both subjects increased dorsiflexion of the non-dominant leg during and after the 15 N force exposure. Changes in limb segment coordination also corresponded to bilateral increases in 3D intersegmental trajectory areas. While there was no evidence of increased symmetry based on left and right leg plane comparisons, slight increases in angular velocity were noted just prior to and during the swing phase of the paretic leg during force and post-force epochs. These findings were further substantiated by Sobolev norms which increased bilaterally and proportionally for force and post-force epochs. Adaptation and post-adaptation effects seen in bilateral lower limb coordination when haptic forces were present and released suggest proportional increases in the kinematic and dynamic outcomes. Further investigation involving a wider range of chronic stroke functional levels should be conducted.",60009729,Jewish Rehabilitation Hospital,Laval,Canada,['1705'],26.0,0.012885154061624654,0.2609243697478991,1

1850,1850,Understanding Ability of 3D Integral Displays to Provide Accurate Out-of-focus Retinal Blur," This out-of-focus blur rendered on the retina is an important stimulus for the accommodation response of the eye and hence is one of the major depth cues. Properly designed integral displays can render this out-of-focus blur accurately. In this paper, we report a rigorous simulation study of far-eye integral displays to study their ability to render depth and the out-of-focus blur on the retina. The beam propagation simulation includes the effects of diffraction from light propagation through the free space, the apertures of lenslet and the eye pupil, to calculate spot sizes on the retina formed by multiple views entering the eye. Upon comparing them with the spot sizes from the real objects and taking into account depth of field and spatial resolution of the eye, we determine the minimum number of views needed in the pupil for accurate retinal blur. In other words, we determine the minimum pixel pitch needed for the screen of a given integral display configuration. We do this for integral displays with varying pixel sizes, lenslet parameters and viewing distances to confirm our results. One of the key results of the study is that roughly 10 views are needed in a 4 mm pupil to generate out-of-focus blur similar to the real world. The 10 views are along one dimension only and out-focus-blur is only analyzed for the fovea. We also note that about 20 views in a 4 mm pupil in one dimension in the pupil would be more than sufficient for accurate out-of-focus blur on the fovea. Although 2-3 views in the pupil may start triggering accommodation response as shown previously, much higher density of views is needed to mimic the real world blur.",60033010,Intel Corporation,Santa Clara,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",25.636363636363637,0.179375,0.5537500000000001,0

1854,1854,Subjective comparison of monocular and stereoscopic vision in teleoperation of a robot arm manipulator,"Remote operation of robot manipulators plays a crucial role in various safety-critical application areas such as forestry, mining, surveillance, etc. The capture and display of visual information of the real operation environment in an information-rich way is one of the key factors in achieving effective and robust teleoperation capability. In this paper, through subjective experiments, we comparatively investigate the roles of monocular, i.e. 2D, and stereo capture and display systems in the context of teleoperation of a robot arm. In particular, the positioning task is considered and, for both monocular and stereoscopic cases, two different modes of capture are implemented, which are static capture setup separately located from the robot arm and dynamic capture setup positioned at the tip of the robot arm. The experiments, conducted on 10 subjects (aged 24-33), show that stereo vision systems enable significant increase in accuracy of positioning compared to conventional 2D capture and display cases. In average, the tasks are completed with highest accuracy in the case of dynamic stereo capture setup.",60011170,Tampereen Yliopisto,Tampere,Finland,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",24.0,0.07934173669467788,0.4999299719887955,1
1855,1855,Enhancing mobile VR immersion: A multimodal system of neural networks approach to an IMU gesture controller,"An effect of immersion is a desirable quality in VR interfaces and its improvement has received a lot of attention in recent years. However, enhancing immersion by eliciting feelings of embodiment and presence through multimodal interactions often requires expensive and bulky dedicated tracking systems. This renders these interactions prohibitable for mobile VR platforms. Our work focused on developing a voice and motion gesture controller with tactile feedback to induce physical sensations and arouse the feeling of embodiment and presence in mobile VR platforms. A mobile virtual reality interface was designed to validate our system through a user experiment. The results indicate that the feelings of presence, embodiment and overall immersion in the mobile VR interface were increased by the use of our system.",60032619,Université Laval,Quebec,Canada,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",20.5,-0.125,0.2732142857142857,1
