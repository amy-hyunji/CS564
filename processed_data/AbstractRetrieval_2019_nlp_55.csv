0,0,Emitter threat evaluation based on IFS-TWD,"In view of the shortcomings of the existing radar emitter threat evaluation, the model is applied to emitter threat evaluation by utilizing the uncertainty problem processing ability and delayed decision making ability of intuitionistic fuzzy set(IFS)-three-way decision(TWD) model. Firstly, five PDW parameters of radar emitter are extracted, fuzzy matrix of target set and attribute set and weight matrix of PDW parameters are constructed, and then fuzzy transformation is used to construct synthetic intuitionistic fuzzy set matrix. Then, an intuitionistic fuzzy set-three-way decision model is constructed by combining threshold value and intuitionistic fuzzy set matrix. Finally, the threat degree of emitter is evaluated according to the model. The experimental results show that the model overcomes the uncertainty in the process of processing and avoids the judgment error easily caused by two-way decision. The emitter is divided into different domains according to the degree of emitter threat, and the emitter threat evaluation is realized with high speed and reliability.",60069720,Air Force Engineering University China,Xi'an,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",26.166666666666668,0.15722222222222224,0.6177777777777779,1

First of all, the malicious code file was converted into the byte stream sequences of the same length, with each byte element (ranging from [0x00, 0xff]) represented by one-hot encoding. The features of the sequences were fully learnt by BiGRU according to their contextual hidden states. The hidden states of all time steps were output. Then, the hidden states of malicious time steps were assigned with more weights by using the self-attention mechanism, and the linear weighted sum of the hidden states were taken as the deep feature representation of the sample sequence. Finally, the feature representation was input to the fully connected neural network layer and the softmax layer to output the prediction probability of the sample. According to the experimental results, the AR of the proposed method increased by 12.25%, and its FPR reduced by 66.42% compared with the suboptimal results.

10,10,Improve efficiency in multidimensional database queries through the use of additives aggregation functions," Published by Elsevier B.V.Frequently queries to multidimensional databases act on considerable amounts of information and their results are not stored for later use. Also, many of the measures stored in the multidimensional variables are not reusable because they represent measures that are only valid at a certain level of aggregation. However, many indicators of different types could be calculated indirectly from expressions based on additive functions, which have the potential to reuse previous results obtained at different levels of aggregation. If besides some results that can be subject to frequent queries to be stored are properly chosen, proper management of them has the potential to significantly reduce the volume of data and computational resources required to respond to a query. This paper presents an extension of a special formulation of the multidimensional model, which incorporates the ability to use and manage transparently for the user different levels of aggregation of a multidimensional variable initial called generator. Also, the operators and structures necessary to achieve this capacity in the model are defined. Initial estimates show that by choosing to store the aggregations frequently required in the consultations, in many cases it will allow to significantly reduce the amount of data and response times in other related consulates, due to the reduction in the volume of data involved.",60105368,Universidad Finis Terrae,Santiago,Chile,['1700'],31.0,0.09400352733686067,0.4849206349206349,0

Following the hypothesis of Environmental Kuznets Curve with collecting data from 1985 to 2015, this paper examines the relation between per capita emissions of main pollutants as well as CO2 and per capita GDP deflator in Heilongjiang Province. Empirical results present that different from the traditional inverted U-shaped curve that was proposed by Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, the curves between each type of emission and per capita GDP deflator have different shapes. Specifically, the shape of curves between per capita emissions of waste water, waste gas, solid waste, CO2 and per cap GDP deflator are the upright N-shape, inverted N-shape, upright U-shape, and inverted N-shape, respectively. With respect to the influencing factors for the disparity of their shapes, per capita annual total trade, regional energy intensity, industrial structure, and technology progress significantly affect the relation between each per capita emission and per capita GDP deflator, but government corruption can concurrently hinder and promote the environmental quality.

The experts' preferences are mapping as preference points with equal weight into two-dimensional space, and expert preferences for the same attribute of same alternative are belong to a point set. Then, the optimal aggregation preference point whose sum of Euclidean distance between expert preference points is the shortest is calculated by the plant growth simulation algorithm (PGSA). The closer the preference information is to the optimal aggregation preference point, the higher the expert weight is, and vice versa. Finally, in order to avoid falling into the trap of ""the minority is subordinate to the majority"", the final expert weight is obtained by modifying the predicted expert weight with iterative correction algorithm.

Nearly 200 projects in the world related to smart healthcare are in the implementation phase [1], and this number is gradually expanding. The smart healthcare is essential parts of creating a smart city, because anyone can go to the hospital for treatment. Especially in the case of a large population base and uneven medical conditions in China. So how to effectively allocate doctor-patient links, maximize the role of medical treatment and medical resources are major tasks. In this paper, we investigate the mobile phone software or hospital official network of smart healthcare in the current Chinese market, and analyze the main functions and shortcomings with the aboriginal lens. We try to use data aggregation screening and distribution technology to solve mainstream problems. Through data aggregation screening and distribution operations, we determine and implement health promotion strategies and approaches, which is also one of the frameworks under the Aboriginal lens. Not only that, but other factors in the framework will also be involved.",60030804,Swinburne University of Technology,Melbourne,Australia,['1700'],20.11111111111111,0.049578373015873006,0.46254960317460325,0
29,29,A CLAIM approach to understanding the pointnet,"Recently, a series of works directly process point clouds and have achieved superior performance in various 3D tasks. However, they are ignorant of the understanding and interpretation of decisions made by these 3D deep learning models. In this work, we focus on explaining the PointNet [1], the first deep learning framework to directly handle 3D point clouds. We propose a class attentive interpretable mapping (CLAIM) approach to visualize and understand what has been learned inside the PointNet. CLAIM quantifies the impact of each point during the decision-making process and indicates the discriminative point set regions used by the PointNet to identify the category. To conduct such a quantitative explanation of the PointNet, CLAIM adds a global average pooling layer after the per-point feature extraction module of PointNet and pass the output to a fully-connected layer that produces the categorical output. As such, CLAIM can associate the global feature directly with categorical scores so that to explore the decisionmaking process of the PointNet. The experiments on ModelNet40 demonstrate the efficacy of our work for getting better understanding the decision-making process of PointNet and the verification experiments further confirm the interpretability of the proposed method.",60073652,Tongji University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.125,0.11764705882352941,0.42843137254901964,1
31,31,An adaptive TDMA-based MAC protocol for underwater acoustic sensor networks,"Acoustic propagation through water suffers from attenuation that increases with both signal frequency and transmission range, with time-varying long propagation delays. The power spectral density of underwater ambient noise also changes with frequency. As a result, the usable channel bandwidth is heavily constrained and Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) is challenging. Striking a balance between channel utilisation and network end-to-end delay is particularly difficult. The Combined Free/Demand Assignment Multiple Access (CFDAMA) protocol has been shown to effectively minimise end-to-end delay and maximise channel utilisation, but existing approaches are reliant on synchronisation which is hard to achieve underwater. This paper introduces a novel robust MAC protocol, based on CFDAMA, exclusively designed for UASNs and called CFDAMA-NoClock. It is capable of providing an adaptive MAC solution without the need for synchronisation amongst independent node clocks. The protocol demonstrates a high level of practicality and simplicity. Both analytical models and comprehensive event-driven simulation of several underwater scenarios show that CFDAMA-NoClock can offer excellent delay/utilisation performance under two distinct traffic types and with various network parameters selected based on practical UASN technologies.",60016418,University of York,York,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",20.555555555555557,0.10114583333333334,0.5504166666666668,1

In this paper, we propose SISR based on a learning-based multi-path with adaptive skip connection model in order to enhance the ramification of super-resolution reconstruction and to fully explore the characteristic of diverse neural network architecture. The proposed method utilizes the characteristics that is coming from different architecture to extract the high-frequency and low-frequency feature of the original image separately through the deep and shallow path. The adaptive skip connection is deployed in the deep path to boost the correlation of the feature extracted which is coming from different layers. The last part that the fusion and reconstruction module use the features which were extracted by previously different path to construct the high-resolution version of the origin image.

36,36,Efficient faster-than-nyquist transceiver design for underwater acoustic communications,"Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling is an attractive technology to improve the spectral efficiency. In this paper, an efficient FTN transceiver is proposed for underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. At the transmitter, the FTN signaling is implemented via the serial concatenation of a sample-rate-convertor (SRC) based on the well-known Farrow filter and the Nyquist pulse shaping. Compare with the conventional FTN signaling, it facilitates the convolution operation and thus achieves the efficient FTN signaling. On the receiver side, the direct-adaptive turbo equalization is employed to combat the hybrid inter-symbol interference (ISI) of the artificial ISI introduced by FTN signaling and the UWA channel-ISI. Wherein the improved proportionate normalized least mean squares (IPNLMS)-based direct-adaptive equalizer (DAE) with the data reuse (DR) aid is adopted as the soft equalizer. As for the channel coding, an irregular convolutional code (IrCC) is designed by matching the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) curve of the DR-IPNLMS-DAE, leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of the turbo iteration. Underwater experimental results verify the advantage of the FTN transmission over the higherorder modulation in terms of improving the spectral efficiency, and they show the proposed FTN transceiver scheme has the better detection performance than the traditional turbo equalization.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.75,0.01446428571428573,0.5744642857142858,1

It has exhibited promising outcomes and has shown incredible potential in solving challenging machine translation exercises. One such exercise is the best approach to furnish great MT to language sets with a little preparing information. In this work, we inspect Zero-Shot Translation (ZST) for a low resource language pair. By working on high resource language pairs for which benchmarks are available, namely Spanish to Portuguese, and training on data sets(Spanish-English and English-Portuguese), we prepare a state of proof for ZST system that gives appropriate results on the available data. Subsequently, we test the same architecture for Sanskrit to Hindi translation for which data is sparse, by training the model on English-Hindi and Sanskrit-English language pairs. To prepare and decipher with the ZST system, we broaden the preparation and interpretation pipelines of the NMT seq2seq model in TensorFlow, incorporating ZST features.

40,40,Review on deep learning methods used for computer-aided lung cancer detection and diagnosis,"Cancer is one of the diseases with high mortality rates in the 21st century, with lung cancer being the first in all cancer morbidity and mortality rates. In recent years, with the large rise of data and artificial intelligence researches, the auxiliary diagnosis of lung cancer based on deep learning has gradually become a hot research topic. As the available and public datasets for lung cancer are mainly CT scans images with lung nodules annotations, the work on the assisted diagnosis of lung cancer using deep learning is mainly based on image data preprocessing, Pulmonary nodule segmentation, and lesion analysis and diagnosis. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools help radiologists to reduce diagnostic errors such as missing tumors and misdiagnosis. So our aim is to help the development of a new CAD system with higher performance than the existent ones to assist lung cancer detection in early stages. This paper presents an overview of the deep learning methods used for computer-aided lung cancer detection and diagnosis. It is mainly focused on the important processing and analyzing methods for the pulmonary image data obtained by medical instrument imaging, and which we can summarize into these 4 steps: Medical image data preprocessing, Pulmonary nodule segmentation, pulmonary nodule detection, and finally lesion diagnosis A full description of the CAD systems steps is given along with an overview of the state of art deep learning medical image processing methods.",60022281,Beijing University of Technology,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",33.285714285714285,0.0818759018759019,0.40085618085618085,1

In large corporations such an internal participatory process may easily involve a large number of people, however time and scheduling constraints are not compatible with gathering them together in presential meetings to reach an alignment around key decision objectives. One of these cases was the selection of a new Enterprise Management System (EMS) for GALP ENERGIA (a Portuguese energy company). The aim of this paper is to report on how a socio-technical process was designed and took place under the ""Collaborative Value Modelling"" framework, combining technical elements of the MACBETH multicriteria evaluation method with two social settings: firstly, Web-Delphi to elicit individual qualitative judgements from a large number of collaborators from the different departments of GALP ENERGIA; followed by a Decision Conference where a small steering committee used the knowledge collected in the Delphi to inform the construction of a quantitative model to compare the EMS alternatives proposed by information technology companies. To detail our rationale, we focus on the qualitative swing-weighting questioning MACBETH mode, implemented in the Welphi information technology platform in which GALP collaborators provided individual weighting judgements, and then in the decision conferencing for final weighting of criteria by the steering committee.

Existing approaches mainly suffer from the extreme density variations. Such density pattern shift poses challenges even for multi-scale model ensembling. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to tackle this problem. First, a patch-level density map is extracted by a density estimation model and further grouped into several density levels which are determined over full datasets. Second, each patch density map is automatically normalized by an online center learning strategy with a multipolar center loss. Such a design can significantly condense the density distribution into several clusters, and enable that the density variance can be learned by a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Our work outperforms the state-of-the-art by 4.2%, 14.3%, 27.1% and 20.1% in MAE, on the ShanghaiTech Part A, ShanghaiTech Part B, UCF-CC-50 and UCF-QNRF datasets, respectively.",60098464,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707']",17.88888888888889,0.07080200501253132,0.35244360902255634,1

46,46,Enhanced Classification Models for Iris Dataset," Published by Elsevier B.V.Data mining and machine learning are both useful tools in the field of data analysis. Classification algorithm is one of the most important techniques in data mining, therefore, it is of great significance to select suitable classification models with high efficiency to show superiority when solving classification problems with the use of Iris data. With this goal, a decision tree induction algorithm, namely graftedTree, is proposed to build randomized decision trees. Randomization is explicitly introduced into this algorithm, such that applying the algorithm several times on the same training data results in diversified models. An ensemble classification model is constructed using multiple randomized decision trees via majority voting. In order to show the performance of different models in classification, we propose the usage of precision, recall, F-Measure, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Gini coefficient as evaluation indexes of the classifying performance on the Iris dataset. The experimental results show that classification with Random Forests model has generally better performance than that with the Boosting Tree model and other three popular algorithms: KNN, SMO and Simple Cart. However, the Gini coefficient of the Random Forests model shows that it gets less pure training set than other models. The new GraftedTrees model inherits the advantages of Random Forest and further employs random mixture of two interchangeable node splitting rule inductions with the aim to obtain higher computational efficiency and better performance in terms of accuracy. With its superiority, it is expected that the new GraftedTrees model can prove to be the most powerful model with better performance in classification in the near future.",60030804,Swinburne University of Technology,Melbourne,Australia,['1700'],26.8,0.1185395976572447,0.45802648332060103,0
47,47,Varieties of chinese discrimination using hybrid squeeze-and-excitation network,"As linguistic differences among related languages are less obvious than those among different languages, automatic language identification in similar languages, varieties, and dialects is a much more challenging task. In this paper, we propose a hybrid SENet (Squeeze-and-Excitation network) based attention model to discriminate varieties of Chinese from six regions (i.e., Mandarin Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao, Malaysia, and Singapore). Firstly, we encode the word embeddings using Bi-LSTM, and automatically extract the discriminative words related to different varieties of Chinese based on SENet. Then, since the original word-embeddings can implicitly encode rich linguistic regularities and patterns, a max-pooling strategy is adopted to extract the most salient features. Finally, we successfully incorporate the SENet and max-pooling to conduct varieties of Chinese discrimination.

Therefore, the examination cheating detection has the vital significance. The existing cheating detection methods have disadvantages such as insufficient modeling accuracy for students, lag in cognitive diagnosis, difficulty in detecting multi-source plagiarism and low accuracy. In order to solve the disadvantages of traditional methods, this paper proposes a method for detecting cheating in multi-index examinations based on feed-forward neural network. This paper first proposes RAE algorithm which combines linear regression and EM algorithm for students' cognitive diagnosis. We use RAE algorithm and LSTM neural network to obtain the knowledge point mastery degree of each student based on the history problem solving and the knowledge point mastery degree based on the exam problem solving. Then, according to the information of students' cognitive level, seat distribution in the examination room, students' habit of guessing answers at normal times, similarity of examination papers, etc., we get several indicators to judge whether students cheat. Finally, we take various indicators obtained through various methods as characteristics and use feed-forward neural network to classify whether students cheat or not.

However, in the most multi-task works, labels are converted to meaningless one-hot vectors, which cause the loss of label semantics closely related to text semantics. Besides, shared and private features captured by previous shared-private multi-task learning framework are usually confused by the fact that the shared unit simply shares the parameters. In this paper, we propose the Adversarial Multi-task Label Embedding model. In this model, we integrate label semantics and improve the performance of multi-task learning. We introduce adversarial training and orthogonal constraints into the multi-task learning framework to prevent shared features and private features from interacting with each other.

Unfortunately, in general, it is an NP-hard problem. Several test generation methods have been proposed to generate a test suite with full fault detection capability. However, they usually generate large test suites with many sequences. In this paper, we propose a search-based software testing method aiming to generate test suites that represent a good trade-off between its cost and its fault coverage. A new encoding, called Node-depth-outdegree Encoding (NDOE) and its mutation and initialization operators are proposed. Also, a new fitness function is presented. The proposed fitness is composed of three objectives: Minimize the test suite length, minimize the number of test sequences, and maximize the fault coverage, which analysis is based on mutation score.

53,53,Memory efficient parallel SAT solving with inprocessing,"Automatic heuristic configuration and algorithm selection can tremendously improve performance in industrial use-cases of SAT solving. In contrast to attempting to select the best heuristic for the problem, portfolio approaches in parallel SAT solving run different heuristics and even algorithms in parallel. This kind of diversification can be very successful because different heuristics and heuristic configurations have better runtimes on different problems.

54,54,Fine-grained image classification combined with label description,"Fine-grained image classification faces huge challenges because fine-grained images are similar overall, and the distinguishable regions are difficult to find. Generally, in this task, label descriptions contain valuable semantic information that is accurately compatible with discriminative features of images (i.e., the description of the 'Rusty Black Bird' corresponding to the morphological characteristics of its image). Bringing these descriptions into consideration is benefit to discern these similar images. Previous works, however, usually ignore label descriptions and just mine informative features from images, thus the performance may be limited. In this paper, we try to take both label descriptions and images into consideration, and we formalize the classification task into a matching task to address this issue. Specifically, Our model is based on a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) over images and Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN) over label descriptions. We map the resulting image representations and text representations to the same dimension for matching and achieve the purpose of classification through the matching operation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the datasets of Stanford dogs and CUB-200-2011.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",23.25,0.056802721088435384,0.40365646258503407,1
55,55,High-speed rail operating environment recognition based on neural network and adversarial training,"Neural network is one of the key technologies for deep learning. Experiments on some standard test datasets show that their recognition ability has reached the level of human beings. However, they are extremely vulnerable to adversarial examples, that is, adding some subtle perturbations to the input example can cause the model to give a wrong output with high confidence. In this paper, we propose a non-contact approach based on neural network and adversarial training to recognize the high-speed rail operating environment. We first built the environment dataset and trained neural network models to do the recognition. We found that our model had high prediction accuracy, but with poor security since it was easy to attack our model using Basic Iterative Methods (BIM). To improve its security, we performed adversarial training based on the adversarial training dataset we built. The evaluation experiments indicated that this approach could improve the security of our model at the same time ensuring the prediction accuracy on the original test dataset.",60073652,Tongji University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",20.625,-0.023666666666666666,0.4831111111111111,1

It is successful in finding bugs in real-world code. The core reasoning techniques use constraint solving, path exploration, and search, which are also the same techniques used in solving combinatorial problems, e.g., finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). We propose CSP instances as more challenging benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of the core techniques in symbolic execution. We transform CSP benchmarks into C programs suitable for testing the reasoning capabilities of symbolic execution tools. From a single CSP P, we transform P depending on transformation choice into different C programs. Preliminary testing with the KLEE, Tracer-X, and LLBMC tools show substantial runtime differences from transformation and solver choice. Our C benchmarks are effective in showing the limitations of existing symbolic execution tools. The motivation for this work is we believe that benchmarks of this form can spur the development and engineering of improved core reasoning in symbolic execution engines.",60021988,Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,Kanpur,India,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",17.77777777777778,0.34761904761904755,0.6599206349206349,1
57,57,Feature-selected and -preserved sampling for high-dimensional stream data summary,"Along with the prosperity of the Mobile Internet, a large amount of stream data has emerged. Stream data cannot be completely stored in memory because of its massive volume and continuous arrival. Moreover, it should be accessed only once and handled in time due to the high cost of multiple accesses. Therefore, the intrinsic nature of stream data calls facilitates the development of a summary in the main memory to enable fast incremental learning and to allow working in limited time and memory. Sampling techniques are one of the commonly used methods for constructing data stream summaries. Given that the traditional random sampling algorithm deviates from the real data distribution and does not consider the true distribution of the stream data attributes, we propose a novel sampling algorithm based on feature-selected and -preserved algorithm. We first use matrix approximation to select important features in stream data. Then, the feature-preserved sampling algorithm is used to generate high-quality representative samples over a sliding window. The sampling quality of our algorithm could guarantee a high degree of consistency between the distribution of attribute values in the population (the entire data) and that in the sample. Experiments on real datasets show that the proposed algorithm can select a representative sample with high efficiency.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",20.9,0.07450113378684807,0.5170521541950113,1

Throughout the selection process, the decision maker interviews one after the other the new candidates and reveals a quality score for each of them. Based on that information, she can (re) assign each job at most once by taking immediate and irrevocable decisions. We relax the hard requirement of the class of dynamic programming algorithms to perfectly know the distribution from which the scores of candidates are drawn, by presenting extensions for the partial and no-information cases, in which the decision maker can learn the underlying score distribution sequentially while interviewing candidates.",60106084,Centre de Mathématiques et de Leurs Applications,Cachan,France,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",26.6,0.12459207459207457,0.367016317016317,1

In such activities, the importance of Web exploration through trial and error has increased. To satisfactorily conduct such exploration, it is important for users to comprehend the process of Web exploration and reflect on their search intentions when constructing queries. However, such tasks are difficult for inexperienced people. In this research, we focus on searchers' behaviors of page selection in the Web exploration process. On the basis of behavior analysis, we have developed methods to extract the clues so that unskilled searchers can become aware of the evaluation against pages they acquired and utilize them in further searches. We develop a novel mechanism for cultivating exploration skills by presenting clues in accordance with a searcher's degree of Web exploration experience.

Existing works tried to explore label information contained in unlabeled data, however most of them suffer from difficulties in separating samples from different categories and have great interference. This paper proposes a novel method named semi-supervised cross-modal hashing based on label prediction and distance preserving(SS-LPDP). First, we use the deep neural networks to extract the feature of the labeled data among different modalities and get the feature distribution of each category. Second, the similarity of the data among different modalities is maximized based on the extracted feature and the label information. A common objective function is proposed with distance preserving constraint, which can effectively separate data into different categories and reduce interference in retrieval. An optimization algorithm is used to update the network parameters of feature learning in each modality, and the label information of unlabeled data are dynamically updated according to the changes of the feature distribution in each iteration. Experimental evaluation on Wiki, Pascal and NUS-WIDE datasets show that the proposed method outperforms recent methods when we set 25% samples without category labels.",60028876,"Inha University, Incheon",Incheon,South Korea,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",23.75,0.14895833333333333,0.4916666666666666,1

A network of such devices forms a wireless sensor network (WSN). Today WSNs find application in various fields like battlefield awareness, environmental monitoring, agriculture etc. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can determine a minimum energy consumption path that also maintains smallest possible end-to-end delay. This will ensure that the data generated by sensor arrays reach their destination in shortest time while consuming minimum energy. The network parameters involved i.e. energy and delay are imprecise in nature, therefore to tackle the prevailing uncertainty, we represent them as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TFN) leading to the constrained fuzzy shortest path problem (CFSPP). To solve this problem, we use CoC ranking and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by simulation analysis. The method proposed in this paper can be integrated with any energy aware WSN protocol.",60121496,Bennett University,Greater Noida,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",17.666666666666668,0.0,0.53,1

63,63,Harnessing GAN with metric learning for one-shot generation on a fine-grained category,"We propose a GAN-based one-shot generation method on a fine-grained category, which represents a subclass of a category, typically with diverse examples. One-shot generation refers to a task of taking an image which belongs to a class not used in the training phase and then generating a set of new images belonging to the same class. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which represents a type of deep neural networks with competing generator and discriminator, has proven to be useful in generating realistic images. Especially DAGAN, which maps the input image to a low-dimensional space via an encoder and then back to the example space via a decoder, has been quite effective with datasets such as handwritten character datasets. However, when the class corresponds to a fine-grained category, DAGAN occasionally generates images which are regarded as belonging to other classes due to the rich variety of the examples in the class and the low dissimilarities of the examples among the classes. For example, it accidentally generates facial images of different persons when the class corresponds to a specific person. To circumvent this problem, we introduce a metric learning with a triplet loss to the bottleneck layer of DAGAN to penalize such a generation. We also extend the optimization algorithm of DAGAN to an alternating procedure for two types of loss functions. Our proposed method outperforms DAGAN in the GAN-test task for VGG-Face dataset and CompCars dataset by 5.6% and 4.8% in accuracy, respectively. We also conducted experiments for the data augmentation task and observed 4.5% higher accuracy for our proposed method over DAGAN for VGG-Face dataset.",60011047,Kyushu University,Fukuoka,Japan,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",26.4,0.0672077922077922,0.3744227994227994,1
64,64,Stealthy malware detection using RNN-Based automated localized feature extraction and classifier,"Malware analysis, detection and classification has allured a lot of researchers in the past few years. Numerous methods based on machine learning (ML), computer vision and deep learning have been applied to this task and have accomplished some pragmatic results. One of the basic assumption of these works is that malware is spawned as a separate thread and the distinguishing features can be extracted in a 'clean' manner irrespective of the malware obfuscation deployed. However, this assumption does not hold true for the advanced malware obfuscation techniques such as code relocation, mutation and polymorphism. Stealthy malware is a malware created by embedding the malware in a benign application through advanced obfuscation strategies to thwart the detection. To perform efficient malware detection for traditional and stealthy malware alike, we propose a two-pronged approach. Firstly, we extract the microarchitectural traces obtained while executing the application, which are fed to the traditional ML classifiers to detect malware spawned as separate thread. In parallel, for an efficient stealthy malware detection, we introduce an automated localized feature extraction technique that will be further processed using the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for classification. To perform this, we translate the application binaries into images and further convert it into sequences and extract local features for stealthy malware detection. With the proposed two-pronged approach, an accuracy of 94% and nearly 90% is achieved in detecting normal and stealthy malware created through code relocation obfuscation technique. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves up to 11% higher detection accuracy compared to the CNN-based sequence classification and hidden Markov model (HMM) based approaches in detecting stealthy malware.",60018319,"George Mason University, Fairfax Campus",Fairfax,United States,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.09090909090909,0.08409090909090909,0.4382575757575758,1

A two-stage motion planner is designed considering collision avoidance, noholonomic constraints and control convergence. In the first stage, the robot is controlled to trace a double-tangential S-shaped (DTS) curve from the starting point to an intermediate point. To ensure zero curvature, the DTS curve is composed of four segments: two arcs of circumference that forms a S-shape and two extension lines that connects to the initial and final configurations. A reference tracking controller is designed to enable the robot to move smoothly with continuous steering profile along the DTS curve. While in the second stage, leveraging on the singularity property of the non- holonomic system, the robot can be asymptotically stabilized at the pre-determined pose with zero steering angle. The proposed parallel system incorporating two control stages is verified to outperform the existing approaches in terms of efficiency and robustness using a differential-drive model through simulation.",60005510,Nanyang Technological University,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",23.285714285714285,0.11666666666666667,0.27037037037037037,1

Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for tumor analysis is one of the key techniques for clinical diagnosis. Experienced experts artificially segment the classical method of brain tumor segmentation according to their anatomical and pathological knowledge, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network structure, namely Feature Mining Networks (FMNet), for brain tumor segmentation. The proposed FMNet adopts three innovative structure, including semantic information mining unit (SIMU), macro information mining unit (MIMU), and a feature correction unit (FCU). These three units can enhance the mining of semantic information and spatial information, and further, modify the information in a direction that is conducive to segmentation results. Each unit can bring significant improvement in segmentation performance. We evaluate the proposed framework on BraTS2017 and BraTS2018 dataset.

67,67,Focus generator with score classification on fabric defect detection,"Fabric defect detection plays an important role in the production of fabrics. Thanks to deep learning and large-scale datasets, popular object detection tasks have made great progress. RetinaNet has been widely used in object detection tasks in various fields, such as face detection, due to its flexibility and operability. It's high accuracy and detection results are derived from datasets with rich features. So limited by the small-scale fabric defect dataset, RetinaNet is difficult to apply to fabric defect detection task. In this paper, we propose an effective neural network approach to solve the problem of small-scale fabric dataset and apply RetinaNet to this task. To overcome the insufficient features because of the small-scale dataset, we first propose a generative model to add Gaussian noise on latent space, called focus generator, which can be controlled with defect instances to generate more data. Then we add a classification model to limit influence produced by the focus generator, called score classification. Finally, we merge the focus generator and score classification with an improved RetinaNet to achieve fabric defect detection, therefore, we name our model FSR. By the way, the operations of adding noise are different on the steps of training and testing. The experimental result shows that our proposed method can achieve better performance comparing to our baseline RetinaNet and finally achieve accuracy of 83.4% on our small-scale fabric defect dataset.",60009860,Fudan University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",20.727272727272727,0.17564625850340135,0.5995804988662132,1
68,68,Salient textural anomaly proposals and classification for metal surface anomalies,"With a drastic growth in the development of Automated Visual Inspection (AVI) systems in the industries, the capabilities of such applications to aid human inspectors for anomaly localization and identification have also increased. However, some issues with anomaly detection and classification in AVI systems are that such anomalies are rare in occurrence and exhibit behaviours that are unique to the application. Hence, these anomaly datasets are small and imbalanced, and a robust framework is required for such datasets. This paper proposes a Salient Textural Anomaly Proposal (STAP) framework to generate and classify salient textural proposals of regions of anomalies on metal surfaces. These anomalies have both salient and texture characteristics that are dependent on the properties of the metal surface. Furthermore, when observed across different lighting conditions, the anomalies in this AVI anomaly dataset have a small inter-class variance and large intraclass variance. The proposed STAP framework uses a Fourier transformation based technique to generate proposals of salient and textural anomaly regions. Transfer learning of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learned from a large dataset is used to train a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the generated proposals. The proposed STAP framework performs the best when compared to state-of-the-art object recognition techniques on an AVI anomaly industrial dataset that has salient and texture anomalies on metal surfaces.",60118946,Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate Lab,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.22222222222222,0.12335164835164836,0.465934065934066,1

Approaches based on deep neural networks have become popular in this context, as a more effective alternative to previous feature-based outcome-prediction methods. However, these approaches rely on a pure supervised learning scheme, and unfit many real-life scenarios where the outcome of (fully unfolded) training traces must be provided by experts. Indeed, since in such a scenario only a small amount of labeled traces are usually given, there is a risk that an inaccurate or overfitting model is discovered. To overcome these issues, a novel outcome-discovery approach is proposed here, which leverages a fine-tuning strategy that learns general-enough trace representations from unlabelled log traces, which are then reused (and adapted) in the discovery of the outcome predictor. Results on real-life data confirmed that our proposal makes a more effective and robust solution for label-scarcity scenarios than current outcome-prediction methods.",60010325,"Istituto Di Calcolo E Reti Ad Alte Prestazioni, Rende",Rende,Italy,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",27.833333333333332,0.2204481792717087,0.5362745098039216,1

Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) uses temporal-difference error (TD error) as replay priority in Deep Q-Networks (DQN), so that agent can learn more effectively from important experiences. However, experiences with large TD error may appear near the edge of state space and these experiences do not help agent learn policy quickly. We present a novel technique called High-Value Prioritized Experience Replay (HVPER), which designs a combination of TD error and value (reward or state-action value) in replay priority. Specifically, we first propose prioritizing replay based on reward and TD error in sparse reward environment. Extendedly, we design prioritizing replay based on state-action value and TD error for more ordinary environment. We design experiments in the gym environment to evaluate the proposed HVPER. First, we verify that the combination of TD error and reward improves the training speed in two problems with sparse rewards compared to DQN algorithm and PER algorithm.

75,75,Gorthaur: A portfolio approach for dynamic selection of multi-armed bandit algorithms for recommendation,"Recommendation systems must reach a good global accuracy but also diversify their recommendations. Despite the theoretically grounded guarantees, we observe that multi-armed bandit algorithms obtain different results depending on the nature of the real-world applications or the offline datasets that is used. Thus, before choosing an algorithm, it is necessary to carry out a preliminary offline evaluation on the criteria of global accuracy and, if necessary, diversity. However, recommendation systems are notoriously hard to evaluate due to their interactive and dynamic nature. Hence, we have implemented a portfolio approach, entitled Gorthaur, which uses a heuristic to dynamically select multi-armed bandits algorithms used for recommending. Thus, Gorthaur aims at selecting algorithms by maximising the two criteria of global accuracy and diversity. Following our results, we observe that the advantage of using Gorthaur is twofold: 1) Find a trade-off in cases where there is no prior knowledge about the nature of the dataset or the recommendation application we want to deploy; 2) Rapidly shed light on a set of optimal algorithms.",60012772,Universite d'Angers,Angers,France,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.142857142857142,0.04880952380952381,0.37023809523809526,1
76,76,Monte carlo tree search with variable simulation periods for continuously running tasks,"Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is widely used for planning in domains where the potential actions can be represented as a tree of sequential decisions. To efficiently select an action, MCTS usually needs to perform many simulations to build a reliable tree representation of the decision space. As such, a bottleneck to MCTS arises when enough simulations cannot be performed between action selections. This is particularly highlighted in continuously running tasks, for which the time available to perform simulations between actions tends to be limited due to the environment's state constantly changing. In this paper, we present an approach that extends the time available for Monte Carlo simulations when allowed. Our approach is to effectively balance the prospect of selecting the right action with the time that can be spared to perform MCTS simulations before the next action selection. For that, we considered the simulation time as a decision variable to be selected alongside an action. We extended the Hierarchical Optimistic Optimization applied to Tree (HOOT) method to adapt our approach to environments with a continuous decision space. We evaluated our approach on tasks with a continuous decision space using OpenAI gym's Pendulum and Continuous Mountain Car environments and on those with discrete action space using the arcade learning environment (ALE) platform. The evaluation results show that, with variable simulation times, the proposed approach outperforms the conventional MCTS in the evaluated continuous decision space tasks and improves the performance of MCTS in most of the ALE tasks.",60025272,University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.7,0.11512896825396828,0.3303075396825396,1

Then, we approximate this mapping by a neural network with best fitting the data from the PDEs, where the initial and boundary conditions are cooperated to the loss function. The main contributions of proposed method are twofold. First, we adopt the quasi-Newton algorithm to minimize the loss instead of the stochastic gradient method, which is benefit from the relatively low sampling rate. It avoids the instability arising from the stochastic method. On the other hand, we adopt the piecewise strategy to improve the computational efficiency. To further understand the approximate process, we also investigate how the network architecture affect the performance. Finally, we compared the proposed method with some state-of-the-art numerical methods for PDEs. The experimental results validate that the proposed method is more flexible and can avoid the difficulties caused by the complexity of target PDEs, and hence obtains the best performance, even for nonlinear equation with shock.",60023813,Shanghai University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",19.3,0.12850877192982454,0.41271929824561404,1
78,78,A new effective neural variational model with mixture-of-gaussians prior for text clustering,"Text clustering is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing and text data mining. It remains challenging because texts have complex internal structure besides the sparsity in the high-dimensional representation. In the paper, we propose a new Neural Variational model with mixture-of-Gaussians prior for Text Clustering (abbr. NVTC) to reveal the underlying textual manifold structure and cluster documents effectively. NVTC is a deep latent variable model built on the basis of the neural variational inference. In NVTC, the stochastic latent variable, which is modeled as one obeying a Gaussian mixture distribution, plays an important role in establishing the association of documents and document labels. On the other hand, by joint learning, NVTC simultaneously learns text encoded representations and cluster assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that NVTC is able to learn clustering-friendly representations of texts. It significantly outperforms several baselines including VAE+GMM, VaDE, LCK-NFC, GSDPMM and LDA on four benchmark text datasets in terms of ACC, NMI, and AMI. Furthermore, NVTC learns effective latent embeddings of texts which are interpretable by topics of texts, where each dimension of latent embeddings corresponds to a specific topic.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",18.5,0.1803977272727273,0.47840909090909095,1

Aiming at the shortest path and the least energy consumption, an adaptive potential field ant colony algorithm (A-APFACO) suitable for path planning of lunar robot was proposed to solve the problems of slow convergence speed and easy to fall into local optimum of ant colony algorithm. This algorithm combines the artificial potential field method with ant colony algorithm, introduces the inducement heuristic factor, and adjusts the state transition rule of the ant colony algorithm dynamically, so that the algorithm has higher global search ability and faster convergence speed.

There are simple procedures to efficiently compute various functions of the data from the PCA approximation. The most important function is arguably the Euclidean distance between data items. This can be used, for example, to solve the approximate nearest neighbor problem. We use random variables to model the inherent uncertainty in such approximations, and apply the Maximum Entropy Method to infer the underlying probability distribution. We propose using the expected values of distances between these random variables as improved estimates of the distance. We show experimentally that in most cases results obtained by our method are more accurate than what is obtained by the classical approach. This improves the accuracy of a classical technique that have been used with little change for over 100 years.",60009415,University of Texas at Dallas,Richardson,United States,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",17.875,0.02569444444444445,0.4328042328042329,1

Taxi recommender system allows both passengers and drivers to minimize waiting times and obtain the current location of each other. In this paper, we present a taxi recommender system based on deep learning for catching taxis. In deep learning technique, random selections of hyperparameters lead to overfitting or underfitting problems in prediction or classification. In particular, determining number of hidden units is one of the critical issues facing research. Therefore, we investigated how hidden units affect the performance of deep learning for taxi recommender system and compared the results of these existing methods for determining number of hidden units.

A problem, however, can be divided into multiple independent subproblems in many cases. Therefore, it is possible to efficiently search for the optimal solution or a near-optimal one by performing optimization for each subproblem. In genetic algorithms (GAs), the relationship between two decision variables is called a linkage, and checking whether there is the linkage is called linkage identification. Identifying linkages enables GAs to perform the optimization for each subproblem. Such GAs use a crossover that does not damage the linkage. However, differential evolution (DE) has better search performance than GAs. Moreover, DE has a procedure similar to the crossover of GA. In this paper, we propose DE using the linkage identification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through numerical experiments of comparing with DE not using the linkage identification and GA using the linkage identification.",60031225,Kyoto Institute of Technology,Kyoto,Japan,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",15.0,0.1111111111111111,0.5027777777777778,1

The proposed Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model predicts the identity of the driver based on the individual's unique driving patterns learned from the vehicle telematics data. Given the telematics is time-series data, the problem is formulated as a time series prediction task to exploit the embedded sequential information. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on three naturalistic driving datasets, which gives high accuracy prediction results.

We use weighted automata decomposed in functions of bounded arity, incremental CFN solving, a simple form of predictive bounding and compressed representations of distance constraints for improved efficiency.

The use of semantic technologies is central to the proposed approach: event data are made available in a format more amenable to enrichment and analytics, and the actual data enrichment technique is based on semantic data reconciliation. The enriched data are represented as Linked Data and managed in a NoSQL database to enable processing of large amounts of data.

On the principle of minimizing cross entropy loss, we derive a new algorithm to iteratively train the deep CNN model on target and auxiliary labels. We demonstrate that by introducing auxiliary attributes to training images, uncertainty can be reduced in target classification tasks, and adversarial effects avoided in multi-task formulation. We evaluated our learning approach on three categories of overlapping image sets for identical, partial overlapping, and disjoint situations.

Currently, there are several ontologies related to food, but they are specialized in specific domains, e.g., from an agricultural, production, or specific health condition point-of-view. There is a lack of a unified knowledge graph that is oriented towards consumers who want to eat healthily, and who need an integrated food suggestion service that encompasses food and recipes that they encounter on a day-to-day basis, along with the provenance of the information they receive. Our resource contribution is a software toolkit that can be used to create a unified food knowledge graph that links the various silos related to food while preserving the provenance information. We describe the construction process of our knowledge graph, the plan for its maintenance, and how this knowledge graph has been utilized in several applications.

In the areas that require flexibility, the ability to analyze situations, human intelligence, and artificial intelligence is the brain that originates the wisdom of machines. The potential benefits they bring seem impossible to limit, and the new way to utilize artificial intelligence does not stop appearing. This paper mainly deals with the issues surrounding the application of artificial intelligence to life and in approaching a rather complex language like Japanese.

In this paper, we explore the idea of extending constraint programming with abstract domains, a structure from program analysis by abstract interpretation. Abstract domains allow us to efficiently process constraints of the same form, such as linear constraints or difference constraints. This classification by constraint sub-languages instead of sub-problems, makes abstract domains more general and more reusable in many problems. We contribute to the definition of an abstract domain encapsulating a constraint solver in a conservative way w.r.t. constraint programming. We also define a product of abstract domains based on reified constraints and under-approximations.

In order to recognize packed executables, the BinStat application was proposed. It is based on two major steps: The feature extraction, which involves the calculation of statistics and information theory properties from a given binary; and the classification, which adopts a decision tree learned from input features of packed and unpacked binaries previously known in order to classify new executables. The results obtained proved the effectiveness of the tool, but the choice of using only one classifier is arguably a weakness that we chose to improve on the present study. For that end, we rebuilt the training and test datasets and selected the following six classifiers to our analyses: Classification and regression trees, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, neural network and support vector machines. Our results show that the original decision tree algorithm adopted in BinStat (C5.0) is not the best choice for the proposed problem.

95,95,Improving irregular text recognition by integrating gabor convolutional network,"Scene text, especially irregular text, is difficult to recognize due to the arbitrary-oriented characters and irregular arrangement. Most existing methods address the irregular text by rectifying it into a regular one, which achieve good performance. However, these methods are possible to remove character information in some curved texts. To overcome this issue, we focus on extracting features that are robust to orientation changes instead of rectifying. In this work, we propose an end-to-end trainable model that combines a Gabor Convolutional Network (GCN) and a Sequence Recognition Network (SRN). The GCN is capable of extracting more robust features against the orientation, which is produced by incorporating Gabor filters of different orientations into Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The SRN is an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model that sequentially outputs characters from the robust features. We evaluate the recognition accuracy of the proposed method on various benchmark datasets of scene text, including both regular and irregular texts. The extensive experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art recognition performance on most of the irregular benchmarks as well as a regular benchmark.",60102426,Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,Suzhou,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",19.77777777777778,0.1171875,0.49619391025641024,1

However, most of the previous studies focus on solving such problem without explicitly considering the impact of severe real-life image degradation (e.g. blur and noise). We can show that robustly recover details from VLR images is a task beyond the ability of current state-of-the-art method. In this paper, we borrow ideas from 'facial composite' and propose an alternative approach to tackle this problem. We endow the degraded VLR images with additional cues by integrating existing face components from multiple reference images into a novel learning pipeline with both low level and high level semantic loss function as well as a specialized adversarial based training scheme. We show that our method is able to effectively and robustly restore relevant facial details from 16x16 images with extreme degradation.

Various models for nested named entity recognition are designed explicitly and usually do not perform well on non-overlapping named entity recognition compared to sequence labeling models. To tackle the aforementioned problem, we propose a novel model named Attention-Based Entity Region Networks (AERNs) for multi-grained entity recognition where multiple entities in a sentence could be non-overlapping or nested. AERNs consist of an entity region recognizer that examines all possible entity regions and an entity region classifier for classifying the regions. Context information is incorporated to improve the performance of named entity recognition by using an attention mechanism that helps the model focus on entity-related context information. Experiments show that AERNs can effectively recognize both nested and non-overlapping entities, and improves the state-of-the-art result by around 3% on several benchmarks datasets.",60021427,Communication University of China,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",26.0,0.153125,0.38125,1
98,98,Age-suitability prediction for literature using a recurrent neural network model,"Digital media holds a strong presence in society today. Providers of digital media may choose to have their content undergo an age-suitability analysis before being published. These analyses provide ratings that denote to which age group(s) a particular media item is appropriate. Content rating systems exist in many countries for television, music, video games, and mobile applications. These systems allow consumers to quickly determine whether or not a given media item is suitable to their age or preference. Literature, on the other hand, remains devoid of a comparable rating system. If a new, human-driven rating system for literature were to be implemented, it would be impeded by the fact that literary content is produced far more rapidly than are other forms of digital media; human working within such a system simply would not be able to read and analyze literature at its current rate of production. Thus, to provide fast, automated age-suitability ratings to works of literature (i.e., books), we propose a computer-driven rating system which predicts a book's content rating within each of eight categories: (a) crude humor/language; (b) drug, alcohol, and tobacco use; (c) kissing; (d) profanity; (e) nudity; (f) sex and intimacy; (g) violence and horror; and (h) gay/lesbian characters given the text of that book.

99,99,The KEEN Universe: An Ecosystem for Knowledge Graph Embeddings with a Focus on Reproducibility and Transferability,"There is an emerging trend of embedding knowledge graphs (KGs) in continuous vector spaces in order to use those for machine learning tasks. Recently, many knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have been proposed that learn low dimensional representations while trying to maintain the structural properties of the KGs such as the similarity of nodes depending on their edges to other nodes. KGEs can be used to address tasks within KGs such as the prediction of novel links and the disambiguation of entities. They can also be used for downstream tasks like question answering and fact-checking. Overall, these tasks are relevant for the semantic web community. Despite their popularity, the reproducibility of KGE experiments and the transferability of proposed KGE models to research fields outside the machine learning community can be a major challenge. Therefore, we present the KEEN Universe, an ecosystem for knowledge graph embeddings that we have developed with a strong focus on reproducibility and transferability.

However, many real-world scenarios do not match the classic TSP modeling. Thus, this paper proposes generating vendors' routes in a sales territory by extending and combining different TSP variants. The proposal deals with many constraints such as prioritizing the most valuable customers, resource limits to visit all customers, time and day windows, multiple days horizon, lunch stop, visit frequency and destination importance. We also introduce a permutational representation with a series of directed arcs, and with a slot to indicate customers that could not be visited. We evaluate SPEA2, NSGA-II, and IVF/NSGA-II Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms against three real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can produce good results in a realistic scenario, maintaining a balance between prioritizing important customers and economic routes. Besides, IVF/NSGA-II outperformed the other algorithms in most cases, and also the manually-created routes, e.g., reducing 35% the route's distance and increasing 60% the route's importance.",60027136,Universidade Federal de Goias,Goiania,Brazil,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",20.0,0.2625,0.42440476190476195,1
105,105,A Form and API Data Management Platform for Progressive Web Application and Serverless Application Architecture,"In the new global economy, web application has become a central issue for an enterprise organization with branches covering many countries around the world. One major issue in early business services research concerned in those organizations is that developing a web application that can support both global and local services at the same time is very difficult. Since at the local level, each country will have different languages, currencies, regulations. Therefore, to develop a system or web application to support business services around the world will have to be repeated the same, but with some details that are different, such as the same invoice form. However, to support services around the world that has repeated the same process but there is detailed information in each country or each language that is different. The objectives of this research are to determine whether to develop a platform that makes Form design to be shared in many countries more easily by automatically linking to the database via API. APIs can be embedded seamlessly into both the front-end and server side. The user interface can be designed smoothly. Export code can be used with HTML. In additional, it can work with serverless applications. Files can be managed in the form of JSON, csv and txt files. The results indicate that the designed platform can support the work that is intended to meet the objectives. Makes Form development in a web application very convenient and reduces many repetitive steps. In addition, data management is also effective. When creating this Form, it helps developers reduce the time it takes to create multiple Forms and reduces the form creation errors in the settings.

With the advent of RDF as a highly expressive knowledge representation language for the Web, various implementations for RDF lists have been proposed. Yet, there is no benchmark so far dedicated to evaluate the performance of triple stores and SPARQL query engines on dealing with ordered linked data. Moreover, essential tasks for evaluating RDF lists, like generating datasets containing RDF lists of various sizes, or generating the same RDF list using different modelling choices, are cumbersome and unprincipled. In this paper, we propose List.MID, a systematic benchmark for evaluating systems serving RDF lists. List.MID consists of a dataset generator, which creates RDF list data in various models and of different sizes; and a set of SPARQL queries. The RDF list data is coherently generated from a large, community-curated base collection of Web MIDI files, rich in lists of musical events of arbitrary length.

Any small vehicle navigation in such a scenario should be able to anticipate the approximate position of the people around it at the next moment, and adjust its path to avoid collisions based on the predicted results. Such a problem of trajectory prediction can be regarded as the task of sequence generation, and we are interested in how to predict the future trajectory of pedestrians based on their past trajectory. In recent years, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model has been successful in sequence prediction tasks. So, this paper proposes a model combining an attention mechanism and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) artificial neural networks, to solve this question. This model can predict a pedestrian's future trajectory by learning his past trajectory.

Directly applying it for multiple taxicabs may cause an excessive overlap of recommended routes. The multi-taxicab recommendation problem is challenging and has been less studied. In this paper, we first formalize a collective mobile sequential recommendation problem based on a classic mathematical model, which characterizes time-varying influence among competing taxicabs. Next, we propose a new evaluation metric for a collection of taxicab routes aimed to minimize the sum of potential travel time. We then develop an efficient algorithm to calculate the metric and design a greedy recommendation method to approximate the solution. Finally, numerical experiments show the superiority of our methods. In trace-driven simulation, the set of routes recommended by our method significantly outperforms those obtained by conventional methods.",60021182,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",16.75,0.05955988455988456,0.4843133718133718,1
110,110,Attribute reduction for partially labeled data based on hypergraph models,"Attribute reduction is an important process in many fields, such as knowledge discovery, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition and so on. However, totally labeled data are quite hard to obtain in real life. Thus, we often have to face the situation that not all the data have been associated with labels in advance. Due to the coexistence of labeled and unlabeled data, attribute reduction problem for partially labeled data becomes more complex and challenging. Many scholars have devoted themselves to solve this problem in the past few years. But current algorithms for partially labeled data are not efficient enough in terms of time complexity. To address this issue, we propose a hypergraph model, where two types of induced hypergraphs are designed from partially labeled decision systems. Then, a fast algorithm based on low-complexity heuristics is raised to compute the minimum vertex cover of a hypergraph. Finally, we propose two types of hypergraph models-based attribute reduction algorithms for partially labeled decision systems.

However, distant supervision may introduce incorrect labels, which harm the performance. Many efforts have been devoted to tackling this problem, but most of them treat relation extraction as a simple classification task. As a result, they ignore useful information that comes from related tasks, i.e., dependency parsing and entity type classification. In this paper, we first propose a novel Multi-Task learning framework for Relation Extraction (MTRE). We employ dependency parsing and entity type classification as auxiliary tasks and relation extraction as the target task. We learn these tasks simultaneously from training instances to take advantage of inductive transfer between auxiliary tasks and the target task. Then we construct a hierarchical neural network, which incorporates dependency and entity representations from auxiliary tasks into a more robust relation representation against the noisy labels.

In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to the joint modeling and interdependent fulfilment of both tasks. In particular, document clustering and topic modeling are seamlessly interrelated under an innovative Bayesian generative model of clusters, topics and contents in text corpora. Such a model assumes that text corpora result from a generative process, in which clusters and topics act as connected latent factors. Essentially, clusters are initially associated with descriptive and actionable topic distributions, that enforce cluster coherence. The individual documents are then assigned to one respective cluster and worded accordingly. Under the devised model, document clustering and topic modeling can be simultaneously performed in an interdependent manner simply by Bayesian reasoning. For this purpose, the mathematical details regarding collapsed Gibbs sampling as well as parameter estimation are derived and implemented into an approximate inference algorithm. Comparative experiments on standard benchmark text corpora reveal the effectiveness of our approach at jointly clustering text documents and unveiling their semantics in terms of coherent topics.",60010325,"Istituto Di Calcolo E Reti Ad Alte Prestazioni, Rende",Rende,Italy,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",20.555555555555557,0.04944444444444444,0.31769841269841265,1

Our evolution as a species is tightly linked to the ability to exchange learned knowledge with one another. It follows that experience sharing (ES) between autonomous and independent agents could become the key to accelerate learning in cooperative multiagent settings. We investigate if randomly selecting experiences to share can increase the performance of deep reinforcement learning agents, and propose three new methods for selecting experiences to accelerate the learning process. Firstly, we introduce Focused ES, which prioritizes unexplored regions of the state space. Secondly, we present Prioritized ES, in which temporal-difference error is used as a measure of priority. Finally, we devise Focused Prioritized ES, which combines both previous approaches. The methods are empirically validated in a control problem. While sharing randomly selected experiences between two Deep Q-Network agents shows no improvement over a single agent baseline, we show that the proposed ES methods can successfully outperform the baseline. In particular, the Focused ES accelerates learning by a factor of 2, reducing by 51% the number of episodes required to complete the task.",60024989,Universidade de Brasília,Brasilia,Brazil,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",19.0,0.030861244019138753,0.4348883572567783,1
114,114,Uplift modeling for cost effective coupon marketing in C-to-C E-Commerce,"E-commerce companies often provide marketing incentives such as price discount coupons to motivate new customers to make their first purchase. However, many customers make purchases only when coupons are distributed to them; they stop making purchases after using the coupons. Thus, for cost-effective marketing, it is desirable for companies to distribute marketing coupons to new customers that have the highest potential to make future purchases without continued coupon incentives. However, it is difficult for e-commerce companies to identify the new customers to be targeted within 30 hours of registration. In this study, we address this problem using uplift modeling for cost-effective marketing. Uplift modeling can be used to identify the time when there is a causal relationship between coupon distribution and future non-coupon purchases. The ability to identify these causal relationships can allow a company to distribute coupons to the most promising customers and improve its business. Several studies have explained the benefits of uplift modeling in real-world e-commerce businesses. In this study, we demonstrate the results of uplift modeling for coupon distribution in a real-world Customer-to-Customer (C-to-C) e-commerce platform. We show that uplift modeling decreases marketing costs by 39.0% with only a negligible reduction in the number of acquired customers who make non-coupon purchases.

115,115,Scaling up prediction of psychosis by natural language processing,"Mental health professionals currently diagnose and treat mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, mainly by analyzing the language and speech of their patients, a method that maybe improved with the usage of artificial intelligence. This study aims to use machine learning to distinguish between the speech of patients who suffer from mental disorders which cause psychosis from that of healthy individuals to improve early detection of schizophrenia. We analyzed forty interview transcripts from patients who have been diagnosed with first episode psychosis. Word embeddings and convolutional neural network were utilized for the classification of patients from healthy individuals. The preliminary test results achieved a prediction rate of 99%, which indicated that our speech classifier was able to discriminate speech in patients from healthy individuals' daily conversations. This suggested that machine learning models can learn and train upon features of natural languages to predict whether or not an individual is beginning to show the first signs of early psychosis based on their speech. This line of inquiry will contribute to the improved identification of individuals at risk for psychiatric symptoms and lead to the development of targeted therapies.

It involves not only ensuring the shortest route of travel but also minimising the effort of reloading goods. Traditional optimisation methods such as exhaustive search and greedy search are hard to achieve an optimal solution for such kinds of complex problems. In this paper, a hybrid heuristic algorithm for the 3L-PDP problem is extended by two key improvements: The usage of a tabu strategy for enlarging the local search space of the large neighbourhood search (LNS) algorithm, which is proposed in the framework of the simulated annealing process, and the employment of complex block generation and depth-first heuristic for incrementally finding one proper box at a time in the packing phase.

117,117,A unified approximation framework for compressing and accelerating deep neural networks,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in a variety of real world applications, i.e., image classification. However, tons of parameters in the networks restrict the efficiency of neural networks due to the large model size and the intensive computation. To address this issue, various approximation techniques have been investigated, which seek for a light weighted network with little performance degradation in exchange of smaller model size or faster inference. Both low-rankness and sparsity are appealing properties for the network approximation. In this paper we propose a unified framework to compress the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by combining these two properties, while taking the nonlinear activation into consideration. Each layer in the network is approximated by the sum of a structured sparse component and a low-rank component, which is formulated as an optimization problem. Then, an extended version of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with guaranteed convergence is presented to solve the relaxed optimization problem. Experiments are carried out on VGG-16, AlexNet and GoogLeNet with large image classification datasets. The results outperform previous work in terms of accuracy degradation, compression rate and speedup ratio.

118,118,Estimating vehicle speed on highway roads from smartphone sensors using deep learning models,"Speed estimation is an open research area because of its importance in many applications and the necessity of replacing GPS due to smartphones battery drainage. Relying on integrating accelerometer values is challenging and generally requires continual utilization of external references to correct speed, because of error accumulation. Therefore, highway speed estimation, in particular, is a difficult problem due to the maintenance of high speeds by vehicles for a long time and the scarcity of reference points like uneven road surfaces, turns, and stops. In this paper, we investigate exploiting micro road surface unevenness that results in vibrations on the accelerometer readings without integrating the acceleration signal. In particular, we employ deep 1D convolutional neural networks to learn and extract robust features that learn the relation between such complex vibrations and speed. Also, the use of bidirectional LSTMs is investigated to benefit from both forward and backward dependencies in the sensed data, and allow a form of integration. Specifically, two highway speed estimation models are proposed. The first uses a deep convolutional neural network with 5 layers and the second uses a deep bidirectional LSTM neural network. The inputs to both networks are the readings from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of a smartphone. The methods achieved mean absolute error results of 5.53 km/hr and 3.71 km/hr, respectively; whereas a related LSTM based method, resulted in a high error rate of 68.05 km/hr.

120,120,Manifold regularized stochastic block model,"Stochastic block models (SBMs) play essential roles in network analysis, especially in those related to unsupervised learning (clustering). Many SBM-based approaches have been proposed to uncover network clusters, by means of maximizing the block-wise posterior probability that generates edges bridging vertices. However, none of them is capable of inferring the cluster preference for each vertex through simultaneously modeling block-wise edge structure, vertex features, and similarities between pairwise vertices. To fill this void, we propose a novel SBM dubbed manifold regularized stochastic model (MrSBM) to perform the task of unsupervised learning in network data in this paper. Besides modeling edges that are within or connecting blocks, MrSBM also considers modeling vertex features utilizing the probabilities of vertex-cluster preference and feature-cluster contribution. In addition, MrSBM attempts to generate manifold similarity of pairwise vertices utilizing the inferred vertex-cluster preference. As a result, the inference of cluster preference may well capture the comparability in the manifold. We design a novel process for network data generation, based on which, we specify the model structure and formulate the network clustering problem using a novel likelihood function. To guarantee MrSBM learns the optimal cluster preference for each vertex, we derive an effective Expectation-Maximization based algorithm for model fitting. MrSBM has been tested on five sets of real-world network data and has been compared with both classical and state-of-the-art approaches to network clustering.

Although it has been shown that AMD can be modelled as a linear program, it is with an exponential number of variables and consequently, there is no known efficient algorithm. We revisit the latter linear program model proposed for the AMD problem and introduce a new one with a polynomial number of variables. We show that the latter model corresponds to a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition of the second one and design efficient solution schemes in polynomial time for both two models.

We examined in prior work Simple Random Sample Selection without Replacement, integrated with the Information Gain-based Feature Selection method, and compared its performance with the unintegrated instance selection and feature selection alone, using a single reduction rate. Our results proved that the integration of instance and feature selection performed much better than instance or feature selection alone. In this paper, we examine our approach in more depth, trying different reduction rates and different distributions of reduction rates between instance reduction and feature reduction.

However, existing methods based on GCN with dependency arcs suffer from imbalance and redundant information in graph. To capture important and refined information in graph, we propose Multi-graph Convolution Network with Jump Connection (MGJ-ED). The multi-graph convolution network module adds a core subgraph splitted from dependency graph which selects important one-hop neighbors' syntactic information in breadth via GCN.

126,126,A novel learning classification scheme for brain EEG patterns,"EEG has been extensively used to aid the diagnosis of various brain disorders and also, for the identification of brain activities during cognitive tasks. However, the visual evaluation of EEG recordings is a demanding process, susceptible to error and bias due to the human factor involved. The development of EEG analysis methods coupled with data processing and mining techniques have assisted the feature extraction process from EEG recordings. In this paper, a novel method for classification of EEG signals based on features derived from the EEG morphology is proposed. The classification accuracy, as illustrated through experiment evaluation, shows that the proposed method can achieve adequate results and moreover the extracted features can be used collaboratively with commonly used features from time and time-frequency domain to increase the EEG signal's classification performance.",60018306,Wright State University,Dayton,United States,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",26.2,-0.013095238095238096,0.3059523809523809,1
127,127,ClaimsKG: A Knowledge Graph of Fact-Checked Claims,"Various research areas at the intersection of computer and social sciences require a ground truth of contextualized claims labelled with their truth values in order to facilitate supervision, validation or reproducibility of approaches dealing, for example, with fact-checking or analysis of societal debates. So far, no reasonably large, up-to-date and queryable corpus of structured information about claims and related metadata is publicly available. In an attempt to fill this gap, we introduce ClaimsKG, a knowledge graph of fact-checked claims, which facilitates structured queries about their truth values, authors, dates, journalistic reviews and other kinds of metadata. ClaimsKG is generated through a semi-automated pipeline, which harvests data from popular fact-checking websites on a regular basis, annotates claims with related entities from DBpedia, and lifts the data to RDF using an RDF/S model that makes use of established vocabularies. In order to harmonise data originating from diverse fact-checking sites, we introduce normalised ratings as well as a simple claims coreference resolution strategy. The current knowledge graph, extensible to new information, consists of 28,383 claims published since 1996, amounting to 6,606,032 triples.",60108488,Université de Montpellier,Montpellier,France,['1700'],29.833333333333332,0.07981185481185481,0.44298842183457565,1
128,128,Multi-agent path planning with heterogeneous cooperation,"Cooperation among different vehicles is a promising concept for Mobility as a Service (MaaS). A principal problem in MaaS is optimizing the vehicle routes to reduce the total travel cost with cooperation. For example, we know that platooning among large trucks could reduce the fuel cost because it decreases the air resistance. Traditional platoons, however, cannot model cooperation among different types of vehicles because the model assumes the homogeneity of vehicle types. We then propose a model that permits heterogeneous cooperation. Targets of our model include a logistic scenario, where a truck for the long-distance delivery also carries small self-driving vehicles for the last mile delivery. For those purposes, we formalize a new route optimization problem with heterogeneous cooperation, and provide its integer programming (IP) formulation as an exact solver. We evaluate our formulation through numerical experiments using synthetic and real graphs. We also validate our concept of heterogeneous cooperation for MaaS with examples.",60003416,Toyota Central Research Development Laboratory Inc,Aichi District,Japan,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",17.11111111111111,0.06824085005903187,0.463616686343959,1

Based on hand isomorphism and hand strength evalution, the framework provides an efficient situation estimation method for six-player poker.

131,131,Integrating an attention mechanism and deep neural network for detection of DGA domain names,"Domain generation algorithms (DGA) are employed by malware to generate domain names as a common practice, with which to confirm rendezvous points to their command-and-control (C2) servers. The detection of DGA domain names is one of the important technologies for command and control communication detection. Considering the randomness of the DGA domain names, recent work in DGA detection employed machine learning methods based on features extracting and deep learning architectures to classify domain names. However, these methods perform poorly on wordlistbased DGA families, which generate domain names by randomly concatenating dictionary words. In this paper, we proposed the ATT-CNN-BiLSTM model to detect and classify DGA domain names. Firstly, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network layer was used to extract the features of the domain sequences information; secondly, the attention layer was used to allocate the corresponding weight of the extracted domain deep information. Finally, the domain feature messages of different weights were put into the output layer to complete the tasks of detection and classification. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model both on regular DGA domain names and wordlist-based ones. To be precise, we got a F1 score of 98.92% for the detection and macro average F1 score of 81% for the classification task of DGA domain names.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.333333333333332,-0.015625000000000007,0.47876602564102566,1

One way to apply to combinatorial optimization problems is to make decisions in finding a solution using neural networks. Pixel-mapped Classification Network (PCN) we propose treats a problem as an image by mapping each vertex onto an image, and approximate evaluation of vertices to construct a tour. This can be regarded as a classification that selects the appropriate vertex. We consider construction algorithms of greedy selecting and using beam-search according to the evaluation by PCN.

In some platforms the tasks are easy, open access and remunerated by micropayment. The crowd is very diversified due to the simplicity of the tasks, but the payment can attract malicious workers. It is essential to identify these malicious workers in order not to consider their answers. In addition, not all workers have the same qualification for a task, so it might be interesting to give more weight to those with more qualifications. In this paper we propose a new method for characterizing the profile of contributors and aggregating answers using the theory of belief functions to estimate uncertain and imprecise answers. In order to evaluate the contributor profile we consider both his qualification for the task and his behaviour during its achievement thanks to his reflection.",60008134,CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,Paris,France,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",20.0,0.2131542699724518,0.41707988980716254,1

The waste of time, money and resources while organizations counter irrelevant cyber threats can turn them into the next victim of malicious hackers. In addition, the online hacking community has grown rapidly, making the cyber threat landscape hard to keep track of. In this work, we describe an AI tool that uses a temporal logical framework to learn rules that correlate malicious hacking activity with real-world cyber incidents, aiming to leverage these rules for predicting future cyber-attacks. The framework considers socio-personal and technical indicators of enterprise attacks, analyzing the hackers and their strategies when they are planning cyber offensives online.

135,135,Embedding learning with heterogeneous event sequence for insider threat detection,"The insider threat is one of the most significant cyber security threats that an organisation can be subject to. The recent research on insider threat detection mostly focuses on finding out anomalousness or abnormal changes from a series of behaviors such as logon, file usage and USB connection. Such behaviors can be described as time series set of different types of events, which we call heterogeneous event sequence. Due to the lack of intrinsic temporal relationship measures among events that contain multiple entities with categorical values, most existing work extracts action categorical values within the heterogeneous event to calculate abnormal scores for action sequences. Different from previous work, we synthetically consider multiple entities within the heterogeneous event and propose a principled and probabilistic model IPHE (Insider threat detection via Probabilistic pairwise interaction and Heterogeneous Event's entity embedding) that models the likelihood of heterogeneous event sequence. The model embeds entities of heterogeneous events into a common latent space to preserve nonlinear relationships between heterogeneous temporal events. Then the likelihood of heterogeneous event sequence can be computed by the pairwise interactions of different entities of heterogeneous event according to entity embeddings. In particular, due to the imbalance of the occurrence rates of different types of events, we propose typewise learning rate for IPHE to adjust step size during model optimization procedure.

Motivated by prior works feature processing for fair learning and feature selection for kernel methods, we propose to learn fair feature embeddings in kernel space, where the demographic discrepancy of feature distributions is minimized.

The state of each component is determined by a Boolean function of the state of (a subset of) the components of the network. This paper addresses the synthesis of these Boolean functions from constraints on their domain and emerging dynamical properties of the resulting network. The dynamical properties relate to the existence and absence of trajectories between partially observed configurations, and to the stable behaviours (fixpoints and cyclic attractors). The synthesis is expressed as a Boolean satisfiability problem relying on Answer-Set Programming with a parametrized complexity, and leads to a complete non-redundant characterization of the set of solutions. Considered constraints are particularly suited to address the synthesis of models of cellular differentiation processes, as illustrated on a case study. The scalability of the approach is demonstrated on random networks with scale-free structures up to 100 to 1,000 nodes depending on the type of constraints.",60008134,CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,Paris,France,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",22.0,-0.1076388888888889,0.32222222222222224,1
138,138,Incorporating domain knowledge in learning word embedding,"Word embedding is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that automatically maps words from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers in an embedding space. It has been widely used in recent years to boost the performance of a variety of NLP tasks such as named entity recognition, syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis. Classic word embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GloVe work well when they are given a large text corpus. When the input texts are sparse as in many specialized domains (e.g., cybersecurity), these methods often fail to produce high-quality vectors. In this paper, we describe a novel method, called Annotation Word Embedding (AWE), to train domain-specific word embeddings from sparse texts. Our method is generic and can leverage diverse types of domain knowledge such as domain vocabulary, semantic relations and attribute specifications. Specifically, our method encodes diverse types of domain knowledge as text annotations and incorporates the annotations in word embedding.

139,139,SLAOE-NN: A deep network with structure learning for aspect and opining co-extraction for NLP,"The task of co-extracting aspects and opinion terms is intended to explicitly extract aspect terms that describe entity features and opinion terms that express emotions from user-generated text. An effective way to accomplish this task is to exploit the relationship between aspect terms and opinion terms by parsing the syntax structure of each sentence. However, this method requires a lot of effort to parse and is highly dependent on the quality of the parsing results. In this paper, we present a deep learning model called SLAOE-NN (Structural Learning and Aspect and Opining Extraction Neural Networks). The proposed model provides an end-to-end solution and does not require any other language resources for preprocessing. Particularly, we use ON-LSTM to generate hidden layer with language structure information which can generate constituency tree unsupervised and we serve it as an auxiliary task for aspect and opinion terms extraction. For aspect terms and opinion terms extract task, we propose different attention mechanism, which can exploit the indirect relationship between aspect term and corresponding opining term to achieve more accurate information extraction.

The algorithms in the Spectral Clustering family typically consist of multiple separate stages (such as similarity matrix construction, low-dimensional embedding, and K-Means clustering as post-processing), which may lead to sub-optimal results because of the possible mismatch between different stages. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end single-stage learning method to clustering called Regularized Non-negative Spectral Embedding (RNSE) which extends Spectral Clustering with the adaptive learning of similarity matrix and meanwhile utilizes non-negative constraints to facilitate one-step clustering (directly from data points to clustering labels). Two well-founded methods, successive alternating projection and strategic multiplicative update, are employed to work out the quite challenging optimization problems in RNSE.

To enhance network representation for Social Relation Extraction (SRE) task, we present a novel deep neural network based model, EsiNet, by learning the structure and semantic information of edges simultaneously. Compared with previous work, EsiNet focuses on further learning the interactions between vertices and capturing the correlations between labels. By jointly optimizing the objective function of these two components, EsiNet can preserve both the semantic and structural information of edges. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that EsiNet outperforms other baselines significantly, by around 3% to 5% on hits@10 absolutely.",60016835,Beijing Institute of Technology,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",21.666666666666668,0.03430059523809524,0.4306547619047619,1

However, existing works of online matching passengers' orders with vehicles usually aims to minimize the total travel distance of drivers or maximize the profit made by the platform running the ride-sharing service. They ignore the fact that vehicle drivers are usually selfish and heterogeneous, and intend to maximize their own payoffs. In this paper, we intend to solve this online matching issue with the aim of maximizing the social welfare of the platform and vehicles. Specifically, we propose two incentive order matching mechanisms based reverse auction (i.e. MSWR-VCG and MSWR-GM), where the vehicle drivers bid for the orders published by the platform to accomplish the order while making profits. We theoretically prove the related properties of our mechanisms, such as truthfulness, individual rationality, budget-balance, etc. We then evaluate the performance of the mechanism based on the real order data of taxis in New York City and demonstrate that our mechanisms can achieve higher social welfare than the state-of-the-art method which is adopted by industry. Furthermore, we find MSWR-VCG can achieve higher payoff for drivers than MSWR-GM and MSWR-GM can balance the effectiveness of social welfare and computational efficiency well.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",22.444444444444443,0.06978609625668449,0.4326203208556149,1
144,144,Unsupervised pedestrian trajectory prediction with graph neural networks,"Trajectory prediction can aid in target tracking, automatic system navigation, social behavior prediction, analysis and other computer vision tasks. When people walk in crowded spaces such as sidewalks, subway and airports, etc., they naturally adjust their walking style according to the scene context and follow common social etiquette, such as maintaining separation and avoiding collisions. Accurate prediction of trajectories is a big challenge in a crowded scenario where interaction between targets may cause complex societal dynamics. Unlike the prediction of a single person trajectory, it is difficult to capture the real motion of multiple people by only considering the historical positions of each individual separately. Benefit from the recent success of graph neural networks, we propose a model called GNN-TP for pedestrian trajectory prediction. GNN-TP is a purely data-driven model that simultaneously infers the interactions between pedestrians in an unsupervised way and predicts their future trajectories jointly in crowded scenes. On the one hand, GNN-TP infers the interactions employing the observed historical trajectories. We transfer pedestrians' information on the graph-structured data and classify the interaction type based on edges' features. On the other hand, it learns the dynamical model and predicts future trajectories based on the inferred interactions and the observations.

Deep forest, a supervised ensemble model based on decision trees, has been proven to have excellent classification performance and strong generalization ability across different fields. However, when dealing with high-dimensional and small-sample gene expression data, commonly used supervised learning methods including deep forest may not be effective. In this paper, we propose DPCAForest, a deep-forest-based model, which integrates deep forest and dynamic principle component analysis. DPCAForest adaptively generates the minority samples based on sample distribution, then conducts principle component analysis dynamically synchronized with growth of deep forest to reveal the important features with the highest variance. Dynamic PCA enables the model to perform feature extraction in a data-driven way based on cross-validation, and the model can obtain fusion information across layers.

Unfortunately, low cost consumer devices are often prone to capture artifacts, and this is why there is a growing demand for automatic post-processing to enhance the image quality. Due to the wide range of distortions in non-professional photography, automatic selection of the post-processing methods and parameters is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a subjective study based on rank-ordering method, comparing the subjective preferences between photos processed with different parameters for image sharpening and denoising. The subjective results are used as a basis to derive the ground truth values for the post-processing parameters for different photos. Then, we apply a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract a set of features from photos, used as input to a regression model to predict the optimal post-processing parameters.

Unlike Gaussian denoising on which most existing methods focus, the real-world noise is nonadditive, and the distributions are difficult to model. This leads to unsatisfactory performance when applying a Gaussian denoising approach on real-world denoising problems. In this paper, we propose a simple framework for effective real-world image denoising. Specifically, we investigate the intrinsic properties of the Gaussian denoising prior and demonstrate this prior can aid real-world image denoising. To leverage this prior, we fine-tune it for only one epoch on a recently proposed real-world image denoising dataset, and the learned model can enhance both visual and quantitative results (peak-signal-noise-ratio) for real-world image denoising tasks.

150,150,Bayesian network learning for classification via transfer method,"In classification problem, Bayesian networks play an important role because of its efficiency and interpretability. Bayesian networks learning methods require enough data to produce reliable results. Unfortunately, in practice, the training data are often either too few, expensive to label, or easy to be outdated. However, there may be sufficient labeled data that are available in a different but related domain. Learning reliable Bayesian networks from limited data is difficult; and transfer learning might be used to improve the robustness of learned networks by combining data from auxiliary and related labeled dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for Bayesian networks for classification that considers both structure and parameter learning. Our solution is to first construct the initial Bayesian networks model for auxiliary labeled data, and then revise the model according to an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, structure and parameters are revised by turns, in order to make it applicable to the target unlabeled dataset. We mainly apply our method on a special type of Bayesian networks, namely tree-based Bayesian network.

Determining right constraints is a hard and laborsome task. We propose an approach to automate this process using artificial intelligence and machine learning principles. We focus on personnel rostering and scheduling problems in which there are often past schedules available and show that it is possible to automatically learn constraints from such examples. To realize this, we adapted some techniques from the constraint programming community and extended them in order to cope with multidimensional examples. The method uses a tensor representation of the example, which helps in capturing the dimensionality as well as the structure of the example, and applies tensor operations to find the constraints that are satisfied by the example. The algorithm also identifies inherent clusters in the data and uses it as background knowledge to learn more detailed constraints. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we used constraints from the Nurse Rostering Competition and generated solutions that satisfy these constraints; these solutions were then used as examples to learn constraints. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of producing human readable constraints that capture the underlying characteristics of the examples.",60025063,KU Leuven,3000 Leuven,Belgium,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",21.77777777777778,0.1264652014652015,0.5751831501831501,1

However, traditional polyp detection approaches suffer from the following drawbacks: Low precision and sensitivity caused by the variance of polyp's appearance, and the system may not be able to detect polyps in real time due to the high computation complexity of the detection algorithms. To alleviate those problems, we introduce a real-time detection framework that incorporates spatial and temporal information extracted from colonoscopy videos. Our framework consists of the following three components: 1) we adopt Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) to generate the proposal bounding boxes in each video frame. 2) Simultaneously, we compute optical flow from neighboring frames to extract temporal information and generate another group of polyp proposals with the temporal detection network. 3) At last, the final result is generated by a fusion module that connects the end of both streams.

However, most of the applications have been limited to game domains or discrete action space which are far from the real world driving. Moreover, it is very tough to tune the parameters of reward mechanism since the driving styles vary a lot among the different users. For instance, an aggressive driver may prefer driving with high acceleration whereas some conservative drivers prefer a safer driving style. Therefore, we propose an apprenticeship learning in combination with deep reinforcement learning approach that allows the agent to learn the driving and stopping behaviors with continuous actions. We use gradient inverse reinforcement learning (GIRL) algorithm to recover the unknown reward function and employ REINFORCE as well as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to learn the optimal policy.

However, since address is usually an unstructured text that has multiple expressions, the use of the address is confusing in the real world, for example, people usually simplify and express addresses according to their own habits. This leads to the challenge of missing and error of important information, which will reduce the efficiency for most of industries. In this paper, we propose an address standardization method based on the seq2seq model to solve the above challenges. We use the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to learn the intrinsic link in the Chinese address and use attention mechanism to determine the weight of different parts of the address. To our knowledge, it is the first method that can complete the missing administrative address information and correct the error of address information without using additional information such as standard address database and geological element table.

Comparing the pre/post measurements of the fatiguing arm, the mean participant changes displayed a decrease in 10 kHz resistance, an increase in bicep circumference, and an increase in self-reports of pain that reached their maximum changes 72-96 hours post-exercise. At the same measurement timepoints, the mean changes of the non-fatigued arms for the participants showed a much smaller magnitude of changes, supporting that the observed changes in resistance and swelling were a result of the exercise protocol and not natural variations due to daily living.",60025371,The University of Alabama,Tuscaloosa,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",34.25,-0.030586080586080585,0.3585164835164835,1
159,159,Constrained state-preserved extreme learning machine,"Reducing the training time for neural networks is a primary focus of research in the field of machine learning. Currently, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method is one of the fastest backpropagation methods. A recently popular alternative to LM backpropagation is the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which produces a closed form optimization of a Single Layer Feed Forward Network for an initially randomized input weight matrix. In this study, we further extend the performance of an ELM by incrementally building on the state of the art, the State-Preserved ELM (SPELM), to produce a Constrained SPELM (CSPELM). To do so, we introduce a constraint, ', which randomly perturbs the input weight matrix after each training cycle, providing a honing mechanism during the search for a better local optimum. We evaluated CSPELM against 13 benchmark datasets, both categorical and continuous. For 8 of the 13 benchmark datasets, CSPELM outperformed, with respect to average accuracy and RMSE, the ELM, SPELM, and LM methods. Further, the results show that in 8 of the 13 benchmark datasets used, CSPELM was the best performing model and only reached a maximum of 195.10 seconds total training time in one example.

It is confirmed that the parameters setting is of vital importance for performance of ACO. This paper proposed a strategy to perform ACO Parameters Control based on Evolutionary Strength (ACOP-ES). First, we transform four parameters setting problem to decision making problem. Then, by learning the evolutionary strength curve, we set sum, peak, and kurtosis of evolutionary strength curve as the objective function, such that the continuous ant colony algorithm can be used to optimize this decision problem. Further, via characterizing an excellent evolutionary curve, a relatively optimal parameters setting can be found. Compared with existing methods, our proposed method focuses on the performance of the running process rather than the results only. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to introduce process performance evaluation of ACO to guide parameters control, and determine the relatively optimal parameters of ACO.

The robotic seeder minimizes human involvement in the sowing process and hence reduces errors, time consumption and increases efficiency. An adjustable feature has been introduced which can be used to adjust the width of the seeder by considering the width of seedbeds in the fields. The robot is equipped with a 2D laser scanner and a seed sowing mechanism. The sensor provides environmental information in the form of distance data which is desired for controlling the movement of the seeder. The information is further used to extract seedbeds using Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) with line fitting. For autonomous navigation, differential drive and PID control have been implemented. The sowing mechanism allows accurate seed sowing in proper alignment. It drops seeds continuously on equidistant positions during movement of the seeder. A simulated field using V-Rep has been created for testing the functionality of the seeder in simulation.

However, syntactic indicators, certain phrases or words like prepositions that are more informative than other words and may be beneficial for identifying semantic relations. Other approaches using fixed text triggers capture such information but ignore the lexical diversity. To leverage both syntactic indicators and sentential contexts, we propose an indicator-aware approach for relation extraction. Firstly, we extract syntactic indicators under the guidance of syntactic knowledge. Then we construct a neural network to incorporate both syntactic indicators and the entire sentences into better relation representations. By this way, the proposed model alleviates the impact of noisy information from entire sentences and breaks the limit of text triggers.

However, most existing methods describe incomplete and distorted video content due to cropped and warped frame or clip-level feature extraction. This paper proposed an approach based on deep learning that preserves the complete contextual relation of temporal human actions in videos. The proposed architecture follows the two-stream network with a novel 3D Convolutional Network (ConvNets) and pyramid pooling layer, to design an end-to-end behavioral feature learning method. The 3D ConvNets extract video-level, spatial-temporal features from two input streams, the RGB images and the corresponding optical flow. The multi-scale pyramid pooling layer fixed the generated feature maps into a unified size regardless of input video size. The final predictions are resulted from a fused softmax scores of two streams, and subject to the weighting factor of each stream. Our experimental results suggest spatial stream slightly higher than the temporal stream, and the performance of the trained model is conditionally optimized.

In this work we extend the CAL500 database by including music videos, since the CAL500 was originally proposed as an audio-only database. The main rationale here is that the music videos must be official as they were developed to convey the same emotion as the song.

167,167,No-PASt-BO: Normalized portfolio allocation strategy for bayesian optimization,"Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a framework for black-box optimization that is especially suitable for expensive cost functions. Among the main parts of a BO algorithm, the acquisition function is of fundamental importance, since it guides the optimization algorithm by translating the uncertainty of the regression model in a utility measure for each point to be evaluated. Considering such aspect, selection and design of acquisition functions are one of the most popular research topics in BO. Since no single acquisition function was proved to have better performance in all tasks, a well-established approach consists of selecting different acquisition functions along the iterations of a BO execution. In such an approach, the GP-Hedge algorithm is a widely used option given its simplicity and good performance. Despite its success in various applications, GP-Hedge shows an undesirable characteristic of accounting on all past performance measures of each acquisition function to select the next function to be used. In this case, good or bad values obtained in an initial iteration may impact the choice of the acquisition function for the rest of the algorithm. This fact may induce a dominant behavior of an acquisition function and impact the final performance of the method. Aiming to overcome such limitation, in this work we propose a variant of GP-Hedge, named No-PASt-BO, that reduce the influence of far past evaluations. Moreover, our method presents a built-in normalization that avoids the functions in the portfolio to have similar probabilities, thus improving the exploration. The obtained results on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks indicate that No-PASt-BO presents competitive performance and always outperforms GP-Hedge.",60020457,Universidade Federal do Ceara,Fortaleza,Brazil,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.0,0.10942857142857139,0.4952380952380952,1

This paper, therefore, addresses this issue as a small part of our proposed personalized content management system by exploiting the voice pattern of the lecturer for identification and for classifying video lectures to the right speaker category. The use of Mel frequency Cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as 2D input features maps to 2D-CNN has shown promising results in contrast to machine learning and deep learning classifiers - making text-independent speaker identification plausible in MOOC setting for automatic video lecture categorization.

Therefore, this study proposes an adversarial part-of-speech tagging method based on reinforcement learning, which solves the problems associated with a lack of a language corpus, time-consuming laborious manual marking, and the low performance of machine marking. Firstly, we construct a markup dictionary based on the grammatical characteristics of standard Zhuang and the Penn Chinese Treebank.

Finally, we use reinforcement learning as the model framework, target parts of speech as the feedback of the environment, and then obtain the optimal policy through adversarial learning.

Firstly, the AMSGRAD algorithm is easy to oscillate; Secondly, the AMSGRAD algorithm converges slowly. After analysis, the above two problems can be solved by the following ways. When gt-1gt > 0, this paper adds the momentum term in Momentum algorithm to the AMSGRAD algorithm to accelerate convergence. When gt-1gt ≤ 0, this paper use SGD algorithm instead of AMSGRAD algorithm to update the model weights. In order to eliminate some negative effects of the previous parameter gradient on the current parameter gradient and reduce the oscillation amplitude of the objective function, the first-order and second-order moment estimations of the parameter gradient are recalculated when gt-1gt ≤ 0.

174,174,Intention interleaving via classical replanning,"The BDI architecture, where agents are modelled based on their belief, desires, and intentions, provides a practical approach to developing intelligent agents. One of the key features of BDI agents is that they are able to pursue multiple intentions in parallel, i.e. in an interleaved manner. Most of the previous works have enabled BDI agents to avoid negative interactions between intentions to ensure the correct execution. However, to avoid execution inefficiencies, BDI agents should also capitalise on positive interactions between intentions. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework where first-principles planning (FPP) is employed to manage the intention interleaving in an automated fashion.

175,175,Design and research of composite web page classification network based on deep learning,"This paper proposes a network model that combines long and short feature extractors to solve the problem of automatic classification of web pages. By analyzing the current major portal websites, the main categories of original corpus are formulated. By analyzing the composition of webpage content, the composite extraction features of long and short feature extractors are designed. The attention mechanism is introduced in the short feature extraction network to enhance the ability of short text information extraction. For the longer text, the long feature extraction network combines the attention mechanism of the word and segment to capture information. In the last layer of the classification, the correction mechanism is used for model fusion, which further improves the accuracy of classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher classification accuracy. The classification indicators under the first-level label all reached 0.94 or higher, and 0.90 under the secondary label. The composite feature extraction network designed in this paper has better anti-noise ability and classification efficiency, and can achieve higher classification accuracy.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",19.11111111111111,0.07916666666666666,0.4026315789473684,1
176,176,DASNet: Dynamic activation sparsity for neural network efficiency improvement,"To improve the execution speed and efficiency of neural networks in embedded systems, it is crucial to decrease the model size and computational complexity. In addition to conventional compression techniques, e.g., weight pruning and quantization, removing unimportant activations can reduce the amount of data communication and the computation cost. Unlike weight parameters, the pattern of activations is directly related to input data and thereby changes dynamically. To regulate the dynamic activation sparsity (DAS), in this work, we propose a generic low-cost approach based on winners-take-all (WTA) dropout technique. The network enhanced by the proposed WTA dropout, namely DASNet, features structured activation sparsity with an improved sparsity level. Compared to the static feature map pruning methods, DASNets provide better computation cost reduction. The WTA technique can be easily applied in deep neural networks without incurring additional training variables.

It constructs a 3D visibility graph by representing external obstacles with discrete polyhedrons and searches for the shortest path on it. To consider the complex internal structure of high DoF robots and take full advantage of redundancy, inverse kinematics is solved as an optimization problem which allows for flexible cost functions and constraints. The distance between the robot and external obstacles is treated as an extra constraint in the optimization which works together with visibility graph for collision avoidance. At the end, a pick-place task was successfully performed among obstacles by a simulated dual-arm quadrupedal robot considering the whole-body kinematics and stability, which demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method.",60002668,"A-Star, Institute for Infocomm Research",Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",25.6,0.08083333333333333,0.2733333333333334,1
178,178,A Scalable Framework for Quality Assessment of RDF Datasets,"Over the last years, Linked Data has grown continuously. Today, we count more than 10,000 datasets being available online following Linked Data standards. These standards allow data to be machine readable and inter-operable. Nevertheless, many applications, such as data integration, search, and interlinking, cannot take full advantage of Linked Data if it is of low quality. There exist a few approaches for the quality assessment of Linked Data, but their performance degrades with the increase in data size and quickly grows beyond the capabilities of a single machine. In this paper, we present DistQualityAssessment – an open source implementation of quality assessment of large RDF datasets that can scale out to a cluster of machines. This is the first distributed, in-memory approach for computing different quality metrics for large RDF datasets using Apache Spark. We also provide a quality assessment pattern that can be used to generate new scalable metrics that can be applied to big data. The work presented here is integrated with the SANSA framework and has been applied to at least three use cases beyond the SANSA community. The results show that our approach is more generic, efficient, and scalable as compared to previously proposed approaches.

179,179,TFPN: Twin feature pyramid networks for object detection,"FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) is one of the most popular object detection networks, which can improve small object detection by enhancing shallow features. However, limited attention has been paid to the improvement of large object detection via deeper feature enhancement. One existing approach merges the feature maps of different layers into a new feature map for object detection, but can lead to increased noise and loss of information. The other approach adds a bottom-up structure after the feature pyramid of FPN, which superimposes the information from shallow layers into the deep feature map but weakens the strength of FPN in detecting small objects. To address these challenges, this paper proposes TFPN (Twin Feature Pyramid Networks), which consists of (1) FPN+, a bottom-up structure that improves large object detection; (2) TPS, a Twin Pyramid Structure that improves medium object detection; and (3) innovative integration of these two with FPN, which can significantly improve the detection accuracy of large and medium objects while maintaining the advantage of FPN in small object detection. Extensive experiments using the MSCOCO object detection datasets and the BDD100K automatic driving dataset demonstrate that TFPN significantly improves over existing models, achieving up to 2.2 improvement in detection accuracy (e.g., 36.3 for FPN vs. 38.5 for TFPN on COCO Val-17).

180,180,An adaptive cross-layer sampling-based node embedding for multiplex networks,"Network embedding aims to learn a latent representation of each node which preserves the structure information. Many real-world networks have multiple dimensions of nodes and multiple types of relations. Therefore, it is more appropriate to represent such kind of networks as multiplex networks. A multiplex network is formed by a set of nodes connected in different layers by links indicating interactions of different types. However, existing random walk based multiplex networks embedding algorithms have problems with sampling bias and imbalanced relation types, thus leading the poor performance in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a node embedding method based on adaptive cross-layer forest fire sampling (FFS) for multiplex networks (FFME). We first focus on the sampling strategies of FFS to address the bias issue of random walk. We utilize a fixed-length queue to record previously visited layers, which can balance the edge distribution over different layers in sampled node sequences. In addition, to adaptively sample node's context, we also propose a metric for node called Neighbors Partition Coefficient (N P C ). The generation process of node sequence is supervised by NPC for adaptive cross-layer sampling.

Recently, some resampling methods have been proposed to improve performance by balancing the training samples. However, over-sampling methods may lead to overfitting, and undersampling methods would lose useful emotion information. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel deep architecture to improve performance in both samples and features imbalance. Specifically, we design a class correction loss function to overcome the gap between majority and minority emotions. Meanwhile, emotionspecific word embedding and a fine-tuning BERT are used to increase the differentiation of emotion words and sentences.

When a change occurs, the optimization algorithm has to give a true response to change. One of the most popular approaches of responding to change is to select some solutions randomly and remove them from the population. Since random selection results in deterioration of the algorithm's performance, the wise selection is crucial. Recently, the Borda count method was applied to find the most appropriate solutions to be eliminated from the population. However, basic Borda suffers from the same weight of information before and after the change. In this paper, we propose a new weighted Borda count so that its parameters are tuned by fuzzy rules. Mamdani fuzzy rules have been employed to tune the weights and distinguish between information before and after the change. Finally, the 'Change Effect' is proposed to calculate the effect of the change on the solutions.

183,183,Some improvements of deep knowledge tracing,"Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), along with other machine learning approaches, are biased toward data used during the training step. Thus, for problems where we have few amounts of data for training, the generalization power will be low, the models will tend to give good results on classes containing many examples and poor results on those with few examples. Theses problems are frequent in educational data where for example, there are skills that are very difficult (floor) or very easy to master (ceiling). There will be less data on students that correctly answered questions related to difficult knowledge and that incorrectly answered questions related to knowledge easy to master. In that case, the DKT is unable to correctly predict the student's answers to questions associated with those skills. To improve the DKT, we penalize the model using a 'cost-sensitive' technique. To overcome the problem of the few amounts of data, we propose a hybrid model combining the DKT and expert knowledge. Thus, the DKT is combined with a Bayesian Network (built from domain experts) by using the attention mechanism. The resulting model can accurately track knowledge of students in Logic-Muse Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), compared to the BKT and the original DKT.",60027863,Université du Québec à Montréal,Montreal,Canada,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",22.333333333333332,0.05363636363636364,0.5049242424242425,1

Current state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection on complex high-dimensional data are based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). However, the traditional GAN loss is not directly aligned with the anomaly detection objective: It encourages the distribution of the generated samples to overlap with the real data and so the resulting discriminator is ineffective as an anomaly detector. In this paper, we propose modifications to the GAN loss such that the generated samples lie at the boundaries of the real data distribution. With our modified GAN loss, our anomaly detection method, called Fence GAN (FGAN), directly uses the discriminator score as an anomaly threshold. Our experimental results on the MNIST, CIFAR10 and KDD99 datasets show that FGAN yields the best anomaly classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.",60023202,"A-Star, Bioinformatics Institute",Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.833333333333332,0.10769230769230768,0.37692307692307697,1

In order to cope with this issue, several solutions were proposed, mostly relying on road-operated traffic management strategies. Recent studies show the potential of connected and automated cars to improve traffic by adapting individual behaviors. For instance, thanks to autonomous decision-making capabilities, platoon systems enable a group of vehicles to travel attached to each other by a virtual link. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) empowered by Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) can be used to control a fleet of cars in a decentralized way. This paper applies this concept for dynamic platoon vehicles system through a multi-agent model based on Newtonian physics to achieve a self-organization at the. The behavior can be improved by offering more computing power or a better knowledge of the environment thanks to a micro-service division. In this proposal, the vehicle is considered to be a physical agent with personal behavior divided into three layers : Perception based on sensor, decision based on physics simulation and application helped by embedded robotics.",60108231,Décision et Information pour les Sytèmes de Production,Villeurbanne,France,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",21.875,0.13593750000000002,0.3360863095238095,1

Firstly, the SE module in the Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) is extracted and normalized to generate the Normalized Squeeze-and-Excitation (NSE) module. Then, 4 NSE modules are applied to the convolutional layers of ResNet.

188,188,Heterogeneous transfer clustering for partial Co-occurrence data,"Heterogeneous transfer clustering can translate knowledge from some related heterogeneous source domains to the target domain without any supervision. Existing works usually use a large amount of complete co-occurrence data to learn the projection functions mapping heterogeneous data to a common latent feature subspace. However, in many real applications, it is not practical to collect abundant co-occurrence data, while the available co-occurrence data are always incomplete. Another commonly encountered problem is that the complex structure of real heterogeneous data may result in substantial degeneration in clustering performance. To address these issues, we propose a heterogeneous transfer clustering method specifically designed for partial co-occurrence data (HTCPC). It is superior to the existing methods in three facets. First, HTCPC fully uses the partial co-occurrence data in both source and target domains to learn a latent space, maximally extracting useful knowledge for clustering from limited information. Second, it incorporates multi-layer hidden representations, accurately preserving the complex hierarchical structure of data. Third, it enforces approximately orthogonal constraint in representations, effectively characterizing the latent subspace with minimal redundancy. An efficient algorithm has been derived and implemented to realize the proposed HTCPC.

189,189,Deep multi-label hashing for image retrieval,"Due to its low storage cost and fast query speed, hashing has been widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale image retrieval, while deep hashing further improves the retrieval quality by learning a good image representation. However, existing deep hash methods simplify multi-label images into single-label processing, so the rich semantic information from multi-label is ignored. Meanwhile, the imbalance of similarity information leads to the wrong sample weight in the loss function, which makes unsatisfactory training performance and lower recall rate. In this paper, we propose Deep Multi-Label Hashing (DMLH) model that generates binary hash codes which retain the semantic relationship of multi-label of the image. The contributions of this new model mainly include the following two aspects: (1) A novel sample weight calculation model adaptively adjusts the weight of the sample pair by calculating the semantic similarity of the multi-label image pairs. (2) The sample weight cross-entropy loss function, which is designed according to the similarity of the image, adjusts the balance of similar image pairs and dissimilar image pairs.

190,190,Adversarial capsule learning for network embedding,"The purpose of network embedding is to learn a low-dimensional representation for each node in the network. One can then use this low-dimensional representation to solve some network analysis tasks, such as node classification and node clustering. At present, there are several network embedding learning methods based on GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) to enhance the robustness of representations. However, these methods have two drawbacks. First, they are often too difficult to be trained stably. Second, they only learn the robust representations by matching the posterior distribution of the latent representations to the given priors. On the contrary, Capsule Networks can learn a more equivariant representation of images that is more robust to the changes in pose and spatial relationships of parts of objects in images. However, there is still no research using Capsule Network for network embedding since the social network is essentially different from images. For this problem, we propose a new approach of adversarial capsule learning (ACL) for network embedding, which is the first time to use Capsule Network in the network analysis tasks. To be specific, the new model consists of two parts, a generator and discriminator. We use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) as the generator to learn the embedding of nodes, and use Capsule Network as the discriminator to distinguish between the real and fake samples as accurately as possible.

Globally, CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females. For colorectal cancer, the best screening test available is the colonoscopy. During a colonoscopic procedure, a tiny camera at the tip of the endoscope generates a video of the internal mucosa of the colon. The video data are displayed on a monitor for the physician to examine the lining of the entire colon and check for colorectal polyps. Detection and removal of colorectal polyps are associated with a reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer. However, the miss rate of polyp detection during colonoscopy procedure is often high even for very experienced physicians. The reason lies in the high variation of polyp in terms of shape, size, textural, color and illumination. Though challenging, with the great advances in object detection techniques, automated polyp detection still demonstrates a great potential in reducing the false negative rate while maintaining a high precision. In this paper, we propose a novel anchor free polyp detector that can localize polyps without using predefined anchor boxes.

Our method accelerates the network in one-step pruning-recovery manner with a novel optimization objective function, which achieves higher accuracy with much less cost compared with existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method allows network compression with global filter pruning. Given a global pruning rate, it can adaptively determine the pruning rate for each single convolutional layer, while these rates are often set as hyper-parameters in previous approaches.

In this paper, we propose an autonomous agent to assist the special needs person (child or adult) in the goal of recognizing risky or insulting situations. The autonomous agent will detect these situations and will signal them to the user (by text, speech, or other signaling forms). We composed a dataset containing 13,490 sentences, categorized into one of four classes: A 'normal' sentence, an insulting sentence, a negative sentence about a different person, or a risky sentence that may indicate a dangerous situation for the special needs person, which requires immediate intervention. We used several machine learning methods, and we found that the most accurate methods were the random forest method with 100 estimators, a voting method using several classifiers, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) with embedding. All of these mechanisms reached an accuracy close to 70% in classifying the sentences in the test set.

The learned features from images are viewed as two-directional sequential data, and we use two LSTM layers that sweep both horizontally and vertically across the image to compress feature matrices. Based on this, the 2D wavelet transform decomposes the above feature matrices as a learned mixing of different harmonic functions, and therefore integrating the spectral analysis into CNNs. We also select 3 × 3 convolutional mixing style with Gaussian+LSM filter to mix the output of the 2D wavelet transform to generate new output features.

A key novelty of the approach lies in its ability to also capture the uncertainty associated with the model output to guide exploration.

200,200,The application of network based embedding in local topic detection from social media,"Detecting local topic from social media is an important task for many applications, such as local event discovery and activity recommendation. Recent years have witnessed growing interest in utilizing spatio-temporal social media for local topic detection. However, conventional topic models consider keywords as independent items, which suffer great limitations in modeling short texts from social media. Therefore, some studies introduce embedding into topic models to preserve the semantic correlation among keywords of short texts. Nevertheless, due to the lack of rich contexts in social media, the performance of these embedding based topic models still remain unsatisfactory. In order to enrich the contexts of keywords, we propose two network based embedding methods, both of which can generate rich contexts for keywords by random walks and produce coherent keyword embeddings for topic modeling. Besides, processing continuous spatio-temporal information in social media is also very challenging. Most of the existing methods simply split time and location into equal-size units, which fall short in capturing the continuity of spatio-temporal information. To address this issue, we present a hotspot detection algorithm to identify spatial and temporal hotspots, which can address spatio-temporal continuity and alleviate data sparsity. Finally, the experiments show that the performance of our methods has been improved significantly compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",21.0,0.13357963875205253,0.3973316912972086,1

This pilot study examines the feasibility and instantaneous effects of real time visual feedback provided in the form of an avatar on gait symmetry. Preliminary results obtained from seven chronic stroke survivors showed no improvements in step length and step time ratios while using three avatar views (back, frontal and paretic side). Improvements in lower limb joint angle symmetry, however, were observed. Faster walking speed and larger paretic step length were also noted during the adaptation and post-adaptation phases.

In this work, we propose Hybrid-TE, a hybrid translation-based temporal knowledge graph embedding, which combines two translation models TransD and HyTE for modeling both temporal and multirelational facts. Benefiting from two underlying models, Hybrid-TE first builds entity and relation embeddings in separate vector space for modelling multi-relational facts, and then explicitly learns time information by translational embedding on timespecific hyperplanes. We observe that a simple combination of two models does not lead to a satisfactory predictive precision. We therefore propose to project a triplet to all time-specific hyperplanes on which it is temporally valid. Besides, we also explore extra negative relation samplings that differ from positive samplings in relations. We conduct extensive experiments with real datasets on link prediction, relation prediction and temporal scope prediction.

For a new task, it is necessary to train the cobot to detect and recognize novel objects. Using dominant object detector based on Faster R-CNN, a user has to train it using a large number of manually annotated samples, which is inefficient and expensive. In this paper, we propose a self-teaching strategy for a cobot to learn to recognize novel objects efficiently and effectively. Like human-to-human teaching, the user just provides a few examples of a novel object captured by an RGB-D camera. The cobot obtains the ground truth annotation of the object automatically through depth segmentation. To achieve robust performance of object detection in real-world scenes, it generates augmented training samples by virtually placing the object in various backgrounds with changing scales and orientations (2D augmentation), and variations of viewpoints through projective transformation (3D augmentation). A state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN is re-trained and evaluated on real-world scenarios for a task of gearbox assembly.

The proposed system can detect potholes by observing the vibration signal when the vehicle passes over the pothole, learn the vehicle parameters by fitting the underdamping vibration signal with stochastic gradient descent, and estimate the depth and length of the pothole.

Providers rendering services to patients typically submit claims to healthcare insurance agencies. Such claims must follow specific compliance criteria specified by state and federal policies. This paper presents an ontology-based system that aims to support the FWA claim investigation process by extracting graph-based actionable knowledge from policy text describing those compliance criteria. We discuss the process of creating a domain-specific ontology to model human experts’ conceptualisations and to incorporate early-on the feedback of FWA investigators, who are the early adopters of our solution. We explore whether the ontology is expressive and flexible enough to model the diverse compliance processes and complex relationships defined in policy documents. The ontology is then used, in combination with natural language understanding and semantic techniques, to guide the extraction of a Knowledge Graph (KG) from policies. Our solution is validated in terms of correctness and completeness by comparing the extracted knowledge to a ground truth created by investigators. Lastly, we discuss further challenges our deployed semantic system needs to tackle in this novel scenario, with the prospect of supporting the investigation process.",60139031,IBM Watson Health,Bethesda,United States,['1700'],24.0,0.03888888888888889,0.3761111111111112,1

Most existing models are time-consuming and cannot be applied to dynamic networks. To alleviate these issues, we apply Arora's sentence2vec model to network embedding to enhance the performance of existing network embedding methods. Under the same framework of the sentence2vec, we name the network embedding method MNE^2, which allows us to leverage the latent representation obtained from a given embedding approach to learn enhanced node embeddings in a network. Taking into account interactions between nodes in the network, the enhanced network embedding can be viewed as the latent factors for generating embedding representations of neighbor nodes. Then, PCA is applied to modify the embedding results to make the enhanced embeddings more expressive. We evaluate MNE^2 on three real-world social network datasets for node classification and link prediction tasks. The results show that MNE^2 can outperform state-of-the-art network embedding learning methods in both tasks.",60014966,Peking University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",21.0,0.32592592592592595,0.462037037037037,1

This task could have many applications, from creating headlines for a general audience based on scientific paper headlines to making offensive language more suitable for children. We focus specifically on sentiment transfer, due to the availability of large sets of data. Text style transfer is uniquely difficult since it is hard to find parallel data, sentence-for-sentence translations, to train on. In this work, we begin by training an encoder neural network to produce representations of text that encode only content, not style, using an adversarial approach. We then introduce a new partly-shared decoder architecture to turn these representations back into sentences, attempting to achieve a better mix of content preservation and style modification. We find that a partly-shared decoder results in content preservation and style modification scores in between different baselines, suggesting a potential utility depending on the desired application.",60011048,IBM Research,Yorktown Heights,United States,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",23.285714285714285,0.10226551226551225,0.5433189033189033,1

Designing linear programs (LPs) is a difficult and expensive process, as it requires both mathematical programming and domain expertise, and it involves both designing an objective function and feasibility constraints. To support this design process, we propose INCALP, an algorithm for inducing linear programs from examples. Since the objective can often be learned with standard techniques (e.g. regression), INCALP learns the hard constraints only. It does so by encoding constraint learning as a mixed integer linear program. INCALP achieves significant efficiency gains by considering gradually larger subsets of examples, and terminating as soon as a suitable program is found. In addition, INCALP encourages both compactness and sparsity of the learned program.

Considering that a perfect variable ordering might result to a backtrack-free search (i.e., finding backdoors, cycle cutsets), finding heuristics for variable ordering has always attracted research interest. For fifteen years, constraint weighting has been shown to be a successful approach for guiding backtrack search. In this paper, we show how the popular generic variable ordering heuristic dom/wdeg can be made more robust by taking finer information at each conflict: The 'current' arity of the failing constraint as well as the size of the current domains of the variables involved in that constraint.

But actually, the real data has multi-category sentiment, is positive, negative, neutral and not mentioned four classes. Therefore, when using common classifying methods to analyzing the data sentiment, if the number of few class data is too scarce, it is difficult to learn useful information from them and the final classifying result will tend to most classes. In order to obtain accurate classification results, this paper proposes a multi-classification method based on the combination of Bert (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) model and Liblinear (A Library for Large Linear Classification) model (It is abbreviated as B-Liblinear). Due to the Bert model's breakthrough in data preprocessing, this paper prepressed training data set, and obtained the word vector and sentence vectors from data. Next, combined with attribute label and sentiment tendency data, the unstructured data was converted into a structured training data set. It was as the standard input data of Liblinear model to construct a classification model. This model's classification mechanism is 'one vs. rest', it can effectively solve the heavy class imbalance problem of massive data in multiple classification tasks. In this paper, the classification result of B-Liblinear model was compared with several classical multi-classification methods.

As floods become more frequent and severe due to climate change, it is increasingly crucial that road infrastructure be strategically upgraded to support post-disaster recovery efforts and normal functionality. We focus on the problem of allocating a fixed budget towards restoring edges to maximize the satisfied travel demand between locations in a network, which we formalize as the budget-constrained prize-collecting Steiner forest problem. We prove that the satisfiable travel demand objective exhibits restricted supermodularity over forests, and utilize this property to design an iterative algorithm based on maximizing successive modular lower bounds for the objective that finds better solutions than a baseline greedy approach. We also propose an extremely fast heuristic for maximizing modular functions subject to knapsack and graph matroid constraints that can be used as a subroutine in the iterative algorithm, or as a standalone method that matches the greedy baseline in terms of quality but is orders of magnitude faster.

One critical step is to find the corresponding relationship between the model point set and the scene point set. Existing registration algorithms primarily utilize the information of global and local shape, yet neglect the credibility of corresponding relation, therefore they may lead to the insufficient estimation of spatial transformation. To tackle this problem, we firstly adopt a relative polar coordinate system, it performs spatial pooling operation and further divides the feature extraction region into sub-areas with different scales. Then, based on the Relative Average Distance (RAD) and the Relative Average Offset Angle (RAOA), we propose multi-granular MRGS descriptor to extract visual structures of the point set. The similarity between the model point set and scene point set is then represented by the Gaussian Mixture Model, where the weights can be dynamically adjusted during the process of registration. Finally, we apply the robust mixture re-weighting to reduce the impact of false corresponding pairs and reinforce the weight of correct matching points.

221,221,Distant-supervised relation extraction with hierarchical attention based on knowledge graph,"Relation Extraction is concentrated on finding the unknown relational facts automatically from the unstructured texts. Most current methods, especially the distant supervision relation extraction (DSRE), have been successfully applied to achieve this goal. DSRE combines knowledge graph and text corpus to corporately generate plenty of labeled data without human efforts. However, the existing methods of DSRE ignore the noisy words within sentences and suffer from the noisy labelling problem; the additional knowledge is represented in a common semantic space and ignores the semantic-space difference between relations and entities. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel hierarchical attention model, named the Bi-GRU-based Knowledge Graph Attention Model (BG2KGA) for DSRE using the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) network. BG2KGA contains the word-level and sentence-level attentions with the guidance of additional knowledge graph, to highlight the key words and sentences respectively which can contribute more to the final relation representations. Further-more, the additional knowledge graph are embedded in the multi-semantic vector space to capture the relations in 1-N, N-1 and N-N entity pairs. Experiments are conducted on a widely used dataset for distant supervision. The experimental results have shown that the proposed model outperforms the current methods and can improve the Precision/Recall (PR) curve area by 8% to 16% compared to the state-of-the-art models; the AUC of BG2KGA can reach 0.468 in the best case.",60006019,China University of Geosciences,Wuhan,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.88888888888889,0.11944444444444444,0.49166666666666675,1

In general, an acyclic CP-net induces a strict partial order over the outcomes. The task of comparing two outcomes (dominance testing) is generally PSPACE-complete, which is a limitation for this intuitive model, especially when representing and solving preference-based constrained optimization problems. In order to overcome this limitation in practice, we propose a divide and conquer algorithm that compares two outcomes according to dominance testing. The algorithm divides the original CP-net into sub CP-nets, and recursively calls itself for each of the sub CP-nets until it reaches to a termination criterion. In the termination criterion, the answer of the dominance query is returned.

However, the uncertainty of the implicit feedback meaning poses a great challenge to the implicit recommendation. Especially for the missing data, we are not sure whether the users dislike or just have not seen the items. It may lead to bias of predictions. In this paper, we propose Neural Fuzzy Inference based on User preference and Item popularity (UI-NFI) algorithm to model the missing data in implicit recommendation. First, we use fuzzy set theory to represent user preference and item popularity that get from the history interactions and side information. Furthermore, neural fuzzy inference is proposed to predict the exposure possibility of missing data.

227,227,Graph attention networks for neural social recommendation,"In recent years, social recommendation is a research hotspot because it contains social network information which can effectively solve the problem of data sparsity and cold start. But the social recommendation task faces two problems: One is that how to accurately learn user latent vector and item latent vector from user-item interaction graph and social graph, the other is that how to depict the intrinsic and complex interaction between users and items. With the development of graph neural networks, node embedding is becoming more and more accurate on the graph. Besides neural collaborative filtering explores the interaction of users and items deeply. So in this paper, we propose a novel model: Graph attention networks for neural social recommendation (GAT-NSR). This model adopts multi-head attention mechanism for message passing on the two graphs, which get user\&item latent vector from different perspectives. And also we design a neural collaborative recommendation module to capture the inherent characteristics of user-item interaction behavior for recommendation.

229,229,An efficient truth discovery mechanism for crowdsensing tasks with temporal and spatial correlations,"Crowdsensing is a promising sensing paradigm to efficiently collect and monitor the physical world by using the embedded sensors in mobile devices. However, the observations (sensory data) submitted by mobile device users may not be reliable. For the same sensing task, users with different reliabilities may submit conflicting information. Thus, we need to estimate the truth based on the submitted observations. Temporal and spatial correlations among tasks are widely observed in crowdsensing applications. However, most of the existing truth discovery mechanisms assume that the tasks are independent, which is not suitable for all crowdsensing applications. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient truth discovery mechanism for crowdsensing tasks with temporal and spatial correlations. To improve the reliability of the estimated truth, we first filter the outliers based on the temporal correlations among tasks, then estimate the truth based on the weighted observations, and finally refine the estimated truth based on the spatial correlations among tasks.

Most of existing knowledge graph (KG) completion models only considers the structural representation of triples, but do not consider the important text information about entity descriptions in the knowledge base. We propose a text-enhanced KG model based on gated convolution network (GConvTE), which can learn entity descriptions and symbol triples jointly by feature fusion. Specifically, each triple (head entity, relation, tail entity) is represented as a 3-column structural embedding matrix, a 3-column textual embedding matrix and a 3-column joint embedding matrix where each column vector represents a triple element. Textual embeddings are obtained by bidirectional gated recurrent unit with attention (A-BGRU) encoding entity descriptions and joint embeddings are obtained by the combination of textual embeddings and structural embeddings. Extending feature dimension in embedding layer, these three matrixs are concatenated into 3-channel feature block to be fed into convolution layer, where the gated unit is added to selectively output the joint features maps. These feature maps are concatenated and then multiplied with a weight vector via a dot product to return a score. The experimental results show that our model GConvTE achieves better link performance than previous state-of-art embedding models on two benchmark datasets.",60019533,Tianjin University,Tianjin,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",26.875,0.07037037037037036,0.5907407407407408,1

In this paper, we present a novel RGB-D dense mapping method, which can obtain accurate, robust and global consistency map even in the above complex conditions. Firstly, the improved ORBSLAM method, which tightly-couples RGB-D information and inertial information to estimate the current pose of robot, is firstly introduced for accurate pose estimation rather than traditional frame-to-frame method in most RGB-D dense mapping methods. Besides, the TSDF (Truncated Signed Distance Function) method is used to effectively fuse depth frame into a global model, and to keep the global consistency of the generated map. Furthermore, since the drift error is inevitable, a deformation graph is constructed to minimize the consistent error in global model, to further improve the mapping performance. The performance of the proposed RGB-D dense mapping method was validated by extensive localization and mapping experiments on public datasets and real scene datasets, and it showed strongly accuracy and robustness over other state-of-the-art methods.

Extensive experiments are conducted on two challenging datasets, the results show high precision-recall characteristics in the cases of severe appearance changes. Besides, our method achieves substantial improvements over the methods using the deep feature representations of a single image for recognition, which makes us believe that the spatiotemporal information contained in the image sequence is significant for place recognition.

These methods either use a block-level approach to distinguish parts of audio containing the event, or analyze the small frames of the audio separately. In this paper, we introduce a new method, AudioMask, for rare sound event detection by combining these two approaches. AudioMask first applies Mask R-CNN, a state-of-the-art algorithm for detecting objects in images, to the log mel-spectrogram of the audio files. Mask R-CNN detects audio segments that might contain the target event by generating bounding boxes around them in time-frequency domain. Then we use a frame-based audio event classifier trained independently from Mask R-CNN, to analyze each individual frame in the candidate segments proposed by Mask R-CNN. A post-processing step combines the outputs of the Mask R-CNN and the frame-level classifier to identify the true events. By evaluating AudioMask over the data sets from 2017 Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) Challenge Task 2, We show that our algorithm performs better than the baseline models by 13.3% in the average F-score and achieves better results compared to the other non-ensemble methods in the challenge.",60018179,University of South Carolina,Columbia,United States,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.0,0.16789772727272728,0.46017992424242427,1

In this paper we describe the development of a replacement engine for L IFTCREATE which seeks to overcome the limitations of the current one.

Online preference learning approaches are by definition adaptive to changes over time of the user preferences which make them more attractive than their static counter-part.

For accurate counting, many excellent algorithms have been proposed, but there are still some challenges in terms of scale variation, occlusion, inaccurate counting in various backgrounds and so forth. In this paper, we propose a new model EFCCNN (Enhanced Feature Channel Convolutional Neural Network) to deal with these challenges. The proposed EFCCNN model has three main contributions. We propose a new convolutional neural network, which can be trained by end-to-end, and it performs better than other crowd counting networks. Additionally, we use SENet (Squeeze-and-Excitation Network) structure to change the channel weight, which can enhance the significant channel, and we use residual structure to transmit the channel weight to improve the counting precision. The SENet structure is helpful to solve the problem of scale variation and occlusion. The EFCCNN model is the first crowd counting model using channel weight information. Furthermore, a new loss function focusing on the structural information of images is proposed, which reduces the mean absolute error of crowd counting, effectively solves the problem of inaccurate counting in various backgrounds, such as crowd miscounting in the tree and brush background, and improves the quality of the crowd density map on SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure).

One of the major challenges in achieving this is the inability to accurately match patient data. Mismatching of patient records can lead to improper treatment which can prove to be fatal. Also, the presence of duplicate overheads has caused inaccessibility to crucial information in the time of need. Existing solutions to patient matching are both time-consuming and non-scalable. This paper proposes a framework, namely, Electronic Patient Matching System (EPMS), which attempts to overcome these barriers while achieving a good accuracy in matching patient records. The framework encodes the patient records using variational autoencoder and amalgamates them by performing locality sensitive hashing on an Apache spark cluster. This makes the process faster and highly scalable. Furthermore, a fuzzy matching of the records in each block is performed using Levenshtein distances to identify the duplicate patient records.

In this paper, we propose a self-learned feature reconstruction (SFR) method and an offset-dilated feature fusion (ODFF) module to improve the prediction reconstruction capability of the decoder. Concretely, SFR can effectively reconstruct the high-resolution feature maps by recombining feature space, in which the space transformation matrix implicitly contained in a convolution layer can selectively highlight features at each position by leveraging the knowledge of label space in a self-learned way. Moreover, ODFF module can effectively fuse multilevel features with multiscale contextual information by feeding the feature maps into designed parallel offset-dilated convolutions, which enhances the feature representation capability of the decoder.

To do this, the choice of an ideal representation is guided by the domain characteristics and the complexity of its cases. Recently, the explosion of deep learning techniques and other forms of vectorised representations, has provided a new source for case insights. Richer text features can be extracted and used for each case if required. In this paper, we build on recent work in this area and generate richer case representation by automatically acquiring domain knowledge from unstructured sentences.

251,251,New approaches to the identification of dependencies between requirements,"There is a high demand for intelligent decision support systems which assist stakeholders in requirements engineering tasks. Examples of such tasks are the elicitation of requirements, release planning, and the identification of requirement-dependencies. In particular, the detection of dependencies between requirements is a major challenge for stakeholders. In this paper, we present two content-based recommendation approaches which automatically detect and recommend such dependencies. The first approach identifies potential dependencies between requirements which are defined on a textual level by exploiting document classification techniques (based on Linear SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbors). This approach uses two different feature types (TF-IDF features vs. probabilistic features). The second recommendation approach is based on Latent Semantic Analysis and defines the baseline for the evaluation with a real-world data set. The evaluation shows that the recommendation approach based on Random Forest using probabilistic features achieves the best prediction quality of all approaches (F1: 0.89).",60019663,Technische Universitat Graz,Graz,Austria,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",16.88888888888889,0.07594444444444444,0.5004444444444445,1
252,252,Coordination in adversarial multi-agent with deep reinforcement learning under partial observability,"We propose a method using several variants of deep Q-network for learning strategic formations in large-scale adversarial multi-agent systems. The goal is to learn how to maximize the probability of acting jointly as coordinated as possible. Our method is called the centralized training and decentralized testing (CTDT) framework that is based on the POMDP during training and dec-POMDP during testing. During the training phase, the centralized neural network's inputs are the collections of local observations of agents of the same team. Although agents only know their action, the centralized network decides the joint action and subsequently distributes these actions to the individual agents. During the test, however, each agent uses a copy of the centralized network and independently decides its action based on its policy and local view. We show that deep reinforcement learning techniques using the CTDT framework can converge and generate several strategic group formations in large-scale multi-agent systems. We also compare the results using the CTDT with those derived from a centralized shared DQN and then we investigate the characteristics of the learned behaviors.",60023462,Waseda University,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",22.125,0.018750000000000003,0.2375,1

Thus, these systems are complicated and usually trained slowly. In this paper, we propose FPSeq, a novel, fully parall framework to simplify and accelerate task-oriented dialogue systems. Specifically, FPSeq turns pipeline design into a single sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to achieve integration of each module for end-to-end training. In addition, multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms are applied in seq2seq learning to achieve parallel computations for speed improvement. Compared to the existing best model, the training speed of FPSeq is 3-10 times faster while only one-third of the number of parameters.

Recently developed topical gamma scintillation sensors provide a way to monitor Time Activity Curves (TACs) and determine the presence of activity remaining at the injection site after injecting dose. However, TAC analysis and visual inspection by physician of static PET images differ in many cases which has been a recent research concern. In this work, a deep learning (DL) based classification was implemented to study whether this approach can be a viable solution to classify the injection data based on their quality. Method: A supervised machine learning technique was adopted and TACs obtained from the sensors were fed as input to a neural network. The network was trained to classify two classes of data i.e. good quality and poor quality injections. The performance of the network was tested on the basis of 3-fold cross-validation. Result: The network could label the good quality (92.39% data) and poor quality (7.61% data) injection data with around ~98% and ~86% accuracy respectively with an overall accuracy of ~97%.

256,256,Experience selection in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning,"Experience replay is a crucial technology for off-policy deep reinforcement learning, which uses a portion of memory as the replay buffer to store previous experience samples for the later policy update. Since each experience sample can be used multiple times, experience replay drastically improves the utilization rate of experience samples. However, how to effectively combine experience replay with multi-agent reinforcement learning is still an open challenge. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, the decision of the agent needs to consider the dynamic information of the environment as well as the behavior of other agents. If the policies of other agents change, updating the current policy with previous experience samples may deteriorate the agents' subsequent decisions. Some methods use a small-capacity replay buffer to store recent experience samples. Although this avoids the problem that the experience sample in the replay buffer is not compatible with the current policy, it will reduce the diversity of experience samples in the replay buffer, that resulting in agents unable to learn the optimal strategy. This paper eases this conflict by enhancing the experience selection mechanism: 1) we use the reservoir retention algorithm to increase the diversity of experience samples in the replay buffer; 2) we use prioritized experience replay to alleviate the problem that the experience sample in the replay buffer is not compatible with the current policy. The experimental results on the covert communication problem confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",26.22222222222222,-0.021296296296296296,0.35277777777777786,1
257,257,Object detection boosting using object attributes in detect and describe framework,"Different objects have unique attributes, visual appearances and physical properties which help human visual system to recognize them better. But can object attributes help improve the object detection performance in computer vision? To answer this very question, we carry out extensive experimentation in this research work and claim that, indeed, object attributes improve the object detection performance significantly. We train feature pyramid networks to learn deep convolutional features for objects and their attributes. When used in combination with each other to infer bounding boxes and class scores for objects, these convolutional features show that object detection boosts significantly. We present a new method to boost the performance of object detection using object attributes in Detect-and-Describe (DaD) framework. We explain multiple approaches for boosting of object detection using their attributes. In these approaches, the convolutional features of attributes are merged with convolutional features of bounding box and class labels using different feature merging techniques to boost object detection. To report the performance of object detection boosting using DaD framework, we train our experimental models on aPascal train split and report performance on aPascal test split. Our results show that object attributes can help boost mean average precision (mAP) of object detection as significant as 2.68%",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",22.666666666666668,0.07369318181818182,0.4021617965367966,1
258,258,SARC: Split-and-recombine networks for knowledge-based recommendation,"Utilizing knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve the performance of recommender systems has attracted increasing attention recently. Existing path-based methods rely heavily on manually designed meta-paths, while embedding-based methods focus on incorporating the knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) into recommender systems, but rarely model user-entity interactions, which can be used to enhance the performance of recommendation. To overcome the shortcomings of previous works, we propose SARC, an embedding-based model that utilizes a novel Split-And-ReCombine strategy for knowledge-based recommendation. Firstly, SARC splits the user-item-entity interactions into three 2-way interactions, i.e., the user-item, user-entity and item-entity interactions. Each of the 2-way interactions can be cast as a graph, and we use Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and KGE to model them. Secondly, SARC recombines the representation of users and items learned from the first step to generates recommendation. In order to distinguish the informative part and meaningless part of the representations, we utilize a gated fusion mechanism. The advantage of our SARC model is that through splitting, we can easily handle and make full use of the 2-way interactions, especially the user-entity interactions, and through recombining, we can extract the most useful information for recommendation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SARC outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.",60118080,School of Computer and Computing Science,Hangzhou,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",22.555555555555557,0.10111111111111112,0.4466666666666666,1

260,260,Attentional autoencoder for weighted implicit collaborative filtering,"Many recommender systems operate on transactional data, of which the most widely available measure is the level of interaction between users and items. In real-world applications the recommendation process is often further divided into two stages: candidate generation, which selects a number of suitable items from the whole inventory, and ranking, which determines the order of suitability among the candidates. In this paper we define two separate tests to represent the candidate generation and ranking tasks, and evaluate a diverse set of old and new collaborative filtering methods on these tests. The results on three different datasets show that model accuracy on the two tasks do not correlate strongly with each other, thus in practical applications the model choice for each task should be considered independently. Furthermore we introduce an attentional autoencoder for implicit recommendation, based on the Autorec and Transformer architectures, trained with a variational objective.

Besides, it is also widely extended to many other research fields such as animation that relies on the automated process of interpolating a 3D model based on user-defined weights or anchors. Such a task will take a lot of effort and time if it is to be done manually. In this paper, we propose to auto-segment the object into several meaningful features. The object will first be converted into 1D skeletal for obtaining the main features. Slinky-based segmentation method is applied to separate each semantic feature. The model then is partitioned in parts and is blended (swapped) from the source to the target model.

The goal of our approach is to infer relevant spatial context features that can be exploitable by bandit-based recommendation systems and improve their performances. For the unsupervised context reasoning step, we use spectral clustering to deduce areas by grouping Wi-Fi access points according to their users' visitations. We have published an anonymized sample of our dataset and our results on the web. Then, we have integrated the deduced spatial context into a mobile cultural events visualization and recommendation app in order to evaluate the global performance online. Thus, over a year we have observed how such spatial context improves bandit-based recommendations in this app by comparing two use cases of the LinUCB algorithm: The first using the original context without the deduced geo-context, and the second using context enriched by our computed spatial context.

We treat every sample as 2D random variable where a data point contained in the sample (such as a pixel) is modelled as an independent and identically distributed random variable (i.i.d) realization. We use several information theory methods to rank and determine when a sample is fed to a network by measuring its pixel composition and its relationship to other samples in the training set. Comparative evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art networks, including, GoogleNet, and VGG, on benchmark datasets demonstrate a syllabus that ranks samples using measures such as Joint Entropy between adjacent samples, can improve learning and significantly reduce the amount of training steps required to achieve desirable training accuracy.

SCRCF exploit the advantages of the spatial regularization method to design a corrective feedback mechanism. The mechanism calculates the reasonable offset to influence the spatial regularization coefficients by observing the output responses of multiple trackers, so as to correct the unreasonable tracking results. Compared to conventional DCF-based trackers, SCRCF is more robust to handle some complicated tracking scenes, such as occlusion and motion blur.

It successfully achieves not only real-time tracking, but also high precision. However, the typical Siamese networks are relatively mean performance to the target of scale variation, rapid deformation and etc due to the operation on the central point of the object only, rather than the entire spatial information. In this paper, we propose a spatial-aware video tracking method called SiamRFC to predict the central point of the tracked object and estimate its spatial configuration simultaneously. Specifically, our SiamRFC firstly predicts the central point of tracked object via Siamese network by judging the similarity. According to this central, we further estimate its optimal anchor configuration of the tracked object among multiple candidates, and then based on the optimal anchor to regress target position.

270,270,Making Study Populations Visible Through Knowledge Graphs,"Treatment recommendations within Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are largely based on findings from clinical trials and case studies, referred to here as research studies, that are often based on highly selective clinical populations, referred to here as study cohorts. When medical practitioners apply CPG recommendations, they need to understand how well their patient population matches the characteristics of those in the study cohort, and thus are confronted with the challenges of locating the study cohort information and making an analytic comparison. To address these challenges, we develop an ontology-enabled prototype system, which exposes the population descriptions in research studies in a declarative manner, with the ultimate goal of allowing medical practitioners to better understand the applicability and generalizability of treatment recommendations. We build a Study Cohort Ontology (SCO) to encode the vocabulary of study population descriptions, that are often reported in the first table in the published work, thus they are often referred to as Table 1. We leverage the well-used Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO) for defining property associations between classes. Further, we model the key components of Table 1s, i.e., collections of study subjects, subject characteristics, and statistical measures in RDF knowledge graphs. We design scenarios for medical practitioners to perform population analysis, and generate cohort similarity visualizations to determine the applicability of a study population to the clinical population of interest.

Then, PFSVI selects the observation z, which lets the successor point b^a^∗;z farthest from B.

274,274,An efficient approach for semantic relatedness evaluation based on semantic neighborhood,"In the context of natural language processing and information retrieval, ontologies can improve the results of the word sense disambiguation (WSD) techniques. By making explicit the semantics of the term, ontology-based semantic measures play a crucial role to determine how different ontology classes have a similar meaning. In this context, it is common to use semantic similarity as a basis for WSD. However, the measures generally consider only taxonomic relationships, which affects negatively the discrimination of two ontology classes that are related by the other relationship types. On the other hand, semantic relatedness measures consider diverse types of relationships to determine how much two classes on the ontology are related. However, these measures, especially the path-based approaches, has as the main drawback a high computational complexity to be calculated in query execution time. Also, for both types of semantic measures, it is unpractical to store all similarity or relatedness values between all ontology classes in memory, especially for large ontologies. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on semantic neighbors that aim to improve the query time in path-based semantic measures without losing their effectiveness in relatedness analysis. We also propose an efficient algorithm to calculate the semantic distance between two ontology classes. We evaluate our proposal in WSD using a pre-existent domain ontology for well-core description. This ontology contains 929 classes related to rock facies and a set of sentences from four different corpora about geology in the Oil\&Gas domain. In the experiments, we compared our approach with state-of-the-art semantic relatedness measures, such as path-based, feature-based, information content, and hybrid methods regarding the F-score, query time and the total number of classes in memory. The experimental results show that the proposed method obtains F-score gains in WSD, as well as an improvement in the query time concerning the traditional path-based approaches. Also, we reduce the total number of classes stored in memory for each ontology class.",60006726,Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,Porto Alegre,Brazil,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",22.785714285714285,0.005638095238095241,0.5600761904761905,1

276,276,Towards a hybrid approach for evolving bayesian networks using genetic algorithms,"Learning the structure of a Bayesian network from data is complex because the number of possible structures increases super-exponentially with the increase in the number of nodes. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid approach comprised of two phases: The constraint-based phase that identifies dependencies among variables to minimize the search space, followed by a score-and-search phase which employs a genetic algorithm to evolve the Bayesian network from the reduced search space. We evaluate the performance of our approach by comparing it with existing algorithms on a limited amount of data sets generated from three benchmark networks. The results illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves good performance in learning the structure particularly for medium to large networks. Next, we apply our method to a new data set generated from a hand-designed network - the RoRSS (Rules of the Road Ship Simulator). The preliminary results indicate that our method is also satisfactory for small networks with a limited amount of data. The work presented here is a proof-of-concept for our proposed approach aimed at discovering knowledge from data samples of varying sizes and in the presence of small to high number of nodes. Based on the results obtained so far, we are confident that our method is suitable to efficiently learn the structure of the RoRSS network from a large data set.",60001769,"University of Nevada, Reno",Reno,United States,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",27.75,0.1124215367965368,0.490879329004329,1

Our approach relies on two key components: 1) a ranking function, based on a new embedding similarity measure, that selects the most relevant embeddings to use given a domain and 2) a dimensionality reduction method that combines the selected embeddings to produce a more compact and efficient encoding that preserves the expressiveness. We empirically show that our method produces effective domain-specific embeddings that consistently improve the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms on multiple tasks, compared to generic embeddings trained on large text corpora.",60106084,Centre de Mathématiques et de Leurs Applications,Cachan,France,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",31.0,0.2210633116883117,0.4320413961038961,1
278,278,Pre-training of autoregressive model for aircraft hard landing prediction based on QAR data,"A hard landing occurs when an aircraft or spacecraft hits the ground with a greater vertical speed and force than in a normal landing, which can cause serious damage to the aircraft and even put passengers in great danger. Predicting the hard landing ahead is valuable, however, it has not been fully investigated. Existing studies mainly apply statistical machine learning algorithms with feature engineering on small-scale data sets. Such methods are primarily dependent on constructing features by experts. In addition, since hard landing samples are difficult to collect, existing research only use a small-scale training sets, which limits the capacity of models. In this paper, we explore a novel autoregressive pre-training approach for hard landing prediction using its flight parameters before touchdown provided by quick access recorder (QAR). QAR is an airborne flight data recorder that records more than 1000 flight parameters throughout the whole flight phase. Large amount of landing data from QAR, which can be considered as multivariate time series, were processed and converted to symbolic representations. Each token represents one landing status in a landing time series. An Aircraft Landing Model (ALM) is pre-trained on these landing token sequences in an autoregressive way that predicts the next landing status according to the previous landing status. The pre-trained ALM can learn the transition patterns between landing status in a normal landing and automatically extract useful features to characterize a landing process. Finally, the pre-trained ALM model is fine-tuned on hard landing training set to predict hard landing. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improved F-Score of hard landing prediction by 14% compared to other methods.",60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",20.615384615384617,0.0365221088435374,0.5352465986394558,1

Following the task formulation of neural machine translation, previous works mainly consider response generation task as a mapping from a source sentence to a target sentence. However, the dialogue model tends to generate safe, commonplace responses (e.g., I don't know) regardless of the input, when learning to maximize the likelihood of response for the given message in an almost loss-less manner just like MT. Different from existing works, we propose a Global-Local Selective Encoding model (GLSE) to extend the seq2seq framework to generate more relevant and informative responses. Specifically, two types of selective gate network are introduced in this work: (i) A local selective word-sentence gate is added after encoding phase of Seq2Seq learning framework, which learns to tailor the original message information and generates a selected input representation. (ii) A global selective bidirectional-context gate is set to control the bidirectional information flow from a BiGRU based encoder to decoder.

280,280,Flood detection in urban areas: Analysis of time series of coherence data in stable scatterers,"The utility of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to produce flood delineation maps is well established. However, flood mapping still represents a challenge in urban settlements, because the radar signatures of flooded urban pixels are generally ambiguous. As a matter of fact, flood mapping algorithms generally do not consider urban areas, thus producing a lot of missed detection errors. Recent studies demonstrated that SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents a suitable tool to at least mitigate this problem. Following these studies, here we analyze time series of complex coherence data in stable scatterers, i.e., pixels exhibiting high backscatter combined with high temporal stability. Our idea is based on the fact the water surfaces show no coherence in a repeat-pass interferogram, so that a decrease of coherence may occur even for stable scatterers if floodwater is present in a resolution cell. The analysis was performed considering the floods that hit the city of Alicante (Spain) in March 2017.

In this study, we develop a stroked finger recognition method for keyboard typing using Myo, a wearable device that can simply measure the surface electromyography (EMG) signal of the user's arm. Our method detects the user's stroked finger through machine learning that uses the measured EMG. We introduced window functions during feature extraction in order to suppress the influence of the keystroke speed.

282,282,Squerall: Virtual Ontology-Based Access to Heterogeneous and Large Data Sources,"The last two decades witnessed a remarkable evolution in terms of data formats, modalities, and storage capabilities. Instead of having to adapt one’s application needs to the, earlier limited, available storage options, today there is a wide array of options to choose from to best meet an application’s needs. This has resulted in vast amounts of data available in a variety of forms and formats which, if interlinked and jointly queried, can generate valuable knowledge and insights. In this article, we describe Squerall: a framework that builds on the principles of Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) to enable the querying of disparate heterogeneous sources using a unique query language, SPARQL. In Squerall, original data is queried on-the-fly without prior data materialization or transformation. In particular, Squerall allows the aggregation and joining of large data in a distributed manner. Squerall supports out-of-the-box five data sources and moreover, it can be programmatically extended to cover more sources and incorporate new query engines. The framework provides user interfaces for the creation of necessary inputs, as well as guiding non-SPARQL experts to write SPARQL queries.

283,283,Improved Weighted Learning Support Vector Machines (SVM) for High Accuracy,"Support Vector machine (SVM) is a linear model designed for classification problem and popular due to a number of their attractive features such as high generalization ability and promising performance. However, the high generalization ability of SVM is only achieved by depending on a small part of the data points to determine an optimal hyperplane. During the learning process, the noise still exists to deviate severely the corresponding decision boundary from the ideal hyperplane. Two different weighted SVM such as one-step WSVM (OWSVM) and iteratively WSVM (iWSVM) has been reviewed besides the standard SVM. This method assigns relative important weights to achieve optimal margin hyperplane. In this study, an improved WSVM using moving weighted average is introduced to generate useful weighted and unweighted support vector for the optimal margin hyperplane. The methods are compared based on correctly labeled, mislabeled data within margin and classification accuracy using three datasets in KEEL repository with 20% noise.

In this paper, sparse interactions are divided into two categories: Intra-group sparse interactions and inter-group sparse interactions. Previous methods can only deal with one specific type of sparse interactions. Aiming at characterizing the two categories of sparse interactions, we use a novel mathematical model called Markov graphical game.

Many works try to compromise spatial resolution to achieve real-time inference speed, which leads to poor performance. As a result, real-time segmentation task for embedded devices is still an open problem. In this paper, we focus on building a network with better performance possible while still achieve real-time inference speed. We first use a pyramid kernel size to capture more spatial information instead of using just a 3×3 kernel size for DWConvolution in ShuffleNet v2. Meanwhile, an efficient Vortex Pooling module is employed to aggregate the contextual information and generate high-resolution features. Compared with other state-of-the-art real-time semantic segmentation networks, the proposed network achieves similar inference speed and better performance on embedded device.

On the one hand, a light-weight backbone network is employed instead of complicated network to quicken detecting speed, and a threshold pruning algorithm is designed to reduce false positive rate. On the other hand, a hybrid loss function, combining weighted softmax loss function with center loss function, is devised to handle both the problems of class imbalance and small inter-class differences. Furthermore, two data synthesis methods are brought forward to solve the small sample problem.

Algorithms based on local activation differences were designed as a biologically plausible alternative to BP. We propose Universal Bidirectional Activation-based Learning, a novel neural model derived from contrastive Hebbian learning. Similarly to what is assumed about learning in the brain, our model defines a single learning rule that can perform multiple ways of learning via special hyperparameters. Unlike others, our model consists of mutually dependent, yet separate weight matrices for different directions of activation propagation. We show that UBAL can learn different tasks (such as pattern retrieval, denoising, or classification) with different setups of the learning hyperparameters.

290,290,SOON: Specifically optimized one-stage network for object detection in remote sensing imagery,"With great significance in military and civilian applications, detecting indistinguishable small objects in wide-scale remote sensing images is still a challenging topic. In this work, we propose a specially optimized one-stage network (SOON) focusing on extracting spatial information of high-resolution images by understanding and analyzing the combination of feature and semantic information of small objects, which consists of feature enhancement, multi-scale detection, and feature fusion. The first part is implemented by constructing a receptive field enhancement (RFE) module and incorporating it into the specific parts of the network where the information of small objects mainly exists. The second part is achieved by four detectors with different sensitivities accessing to the fused and enhanced features, which enables the network to make full use of features in different scales. The third part consolidates the high-level and low-level features by adopting up-sampling, concatenation and convolution operations to build a feature pyramid structure, which explicitly yields strong feature representation and semantic information. In addition, we introduce the Soft-NMS to preserve accurate bounding boxes in the post-processing stage for densely arranged objects. Note that the split and merge strategy, as well as the multi-scale training strategy, are employed in this work.

It has been applied to all aspects of human life. Traditional methods are not competitive for solving pedestrian trajectory prediction problems due to the diversity of its environment and the uncertainty of the original trajectory. Due to the great success of the RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) architecture in sequence prediction, it has become the first choice to us for solving pedestrian trajectory prediction problems in a crowded environment. In this work, in order to solve the problem that RNN architecture does not have great accuracy when the input is long sequence, we use LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) which produces higher accuracy when the input is long sequence. In the process of building our LSTM based prediction model, we find the best loss function through experiments and data analysis. Then we try various model hyperparameters combinations and find best hyperparameter values and parameter ranges that would make the prediction results more accurate. At the same time, we creatively use velocity values of pedestrian trajectory rather than coordinate values as input of the model.

Yet there is rarely any research study on the possible uses of smart watches for learning analytics, particularly for analyzing students' learning activities through the physiological and/or movement data collected on their smart watches. This paper considers a pioneering and sophisticated learning analytics platform using fine-tuned deep learning models to predict students' learning activities based on the real-time data, including their heart rates, calories, three-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data, captured on wearable devices and then uploaded onto a cloud server for thorough analyses. To validate on the actual activities conducted by each student, an intelligent mobile application is developed to push instant notifications for students to report their own activities whenever the change of heart rates are deviated significantly from their normal values. Based on students' heart rates and calories, a long-short term memory (LSTM) model is built to classify students' learning states as active or not with an impressive prediction accuracy of 95% whereas another hybrid model combining both the LSTM and convolutional neural networks attains the highest prediction accuracy of 74% to predict students' specific learning activities as based on their physiological and movement data.

In this paper, we propose a novel neural network named IRP-BERT. It is based on BERT which is the newest breakthrough in natural language processing. IRP-BERT aims at improving the accuracy of predicting the right polarity of aspects in a sentence, especially the neutral ones, because some sentimental-related words such as 'love' in a noun phrase which is neutrally sentimental could have a wrong impact on the polarity classification to aspects. More specifically, we design a module named Irrelevance-Removing Process (IRP) to counteract the impact from irrelevant sentimental-related features.

295,295,Hybrid High-order in Graph Attention Layer,"As a result of approximating the Eigenbasis of the graph Laplacian proposed by GC-layer of Kipf & Welling [5], the convolution operation is efficiently applied from Euclidean domain to graph domain, and the end-to-end deep graph neural network is widely used and developed. However, fixed neighborhood limits the learning ability of the model, and GAT [7] models global node pairs to avoid information loss. In the form, this modeling is equivalent to only considering the firstorder proximity relation of the network, which leads to the indirect and lossy transmission of the higher-order information of the network, even if the multi-layer attention mechanism is used to expand the order of the network. In order to avoid the above situation and obtain higher-order information better, this paper tries to establish the concept of higher-order neighborhood mixed learning of graphs.

Both Subretinal fluid (SRF) and Pigment epithelium detachment(PED) are significant characteristics to help diagnose this disease. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a recognized technology for scanning retinal tissue, due to its non-invasive and high-resolution properties. Classification of SRF and PED among OCT images is thus the main task for macular edema diagnosis. General classification methods are based on classical machine learning applying domain specific knowledge for designing hand-crafted features. We proposed a residual network model to classify SRF and PED features among OCT images. In order to achieve better performance, data augmentation is investigated to respond to the challenge of data shortage. And fine-tuning Residual network from pre-trained parameters is applied. Since the task is a multi-label problem where a single data may have two labels, we also explored the potential correlations between these two labels.

297,297,Using classical planning in adversarial problems,"Many problems from classical planning are applied in the environment with other, possibly adversarial agents. However, plans found by classical planning algorithms lack the robustness against the actions of other agents - the quality of computed plans can be significantly worse compared to the model. To explicitly reason about other (adversarial) agents, the game-theoretic framework can be used. The scalability of game-theoretic algorithms, however, is limited and often insufficient for real-world problems. In this paper, we combine classical domain-independent planning algorithms and game-theoretic strategy-generation algorithm where plans form strategies in the game. Our contribution is threefold. First, we provide the methodology for using classical planning in this game-theoretic framework. Second, we analyze the trade-off between the quality of the planning algorithm and the robustness of final randomized plans and the computation time. Finally, we analyze different variants of integration of classical planning algorithms into the game-theoretic framework and show that at the cost a minor loss in the robustness of final plans, we can significantly reduce the computation time.",60016605,Charles University,Prague Praha,Czech Republic,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",18.77777777777778,-0.008163265306122451,0.4179138321995464,1

Many efforts have been made in this area for years and conference proceedings are full of outstanding work presenting algorithms that are all more efficient than each other. Nevertheless, this paper states that it is just as important to consider in depth the datasets on which we will work later as it is to develop high-performance algorithms. Thus, in this paper, we present the context of a real case of anomaly detection and what work needs to be done on the dataset well before considering the development of new algorithms to process it.

300,300,TPOT-SH: A faster optimization algorithm to solve the AutoML problem on large datasets,"Data are omnipresent nowadays and contain knowledge and patterns that machine learning (ML) algorithms can extract so as to take decisions or perform a task without explicit instructions. To achieve that, these algorithms learn a mathematical model using sample data. However, there are numerous ML algorithms, all learning different models of reality. Furthermore, the behavior of these algorithms can be altered by modifying some of their plethora of hyperparameters. Cleverly tuning these algorithms is costly but essential to reach decent performance. Yet it requires a lot of expertise and remains hard even for experts who tend to resort to exploration-only approaches like random search and grid search. The field of AutoML has consequently emerged in the quest for automatized machine learning processes that would be less expensive than brute force searches. In this paper we continue the research initiated on the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT), an AutoML based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). EAs are typically slow to converge which makes TPOT incapable of scaling to large datasets. As a consequence, we introduce TPOT-SH inspired from the concept of Successive Halving used in Multi-Armed Bandit problems. This solution allows TPOT to explore the search space faster and have much better performance on larger datasets.",60104665,University of Lille,Lille,France,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",18.545454545454547,-0.05076530612244899,0.46692176870748303,1

Manual dimensional measurement using standard gauges can only be applied on a few datums. To measure a huge number of datums, a component needs to be scanned into a point cloud and measured digitally. For precision components, datum generation on the scanned point cloud is labor-intensive. Given a raw point cloud from scanner, this paper proposes an automatic dimensional measurement solution with an adaptive local registration algorithm and an adaptive datum generation algorithm. Using datums on the CAD model as reference, the adaptive local registration algorithm selects local regions on the scanned model to compensate the local deviation between the CAD model and the scanned model. After that, with outliers and noises in the raw data, the adaptive datum generation algorithm creates the correct datums on the scanned model adaptive to the actual geometry. Dimensional measurement based on the generated datums can be achieved automatically. Moreover, the solution does not require users to manually preprocess the point cloud, such as outlier and noise removal. As such, it improves the productivity in dimensional inspection.",60002668,"A-Star, Institute for Infocomm Research",Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",18.0,-0.01743589743589743,0.3215384615384616,1

Experimental results have shown that it is possible to reach the accuracy of 99.20% in the task of identifying different levels of corrosion in the internal surface of thermoelectric pipe walls, while using a compact network that requires much less effort in tuning parameters when compared to the handcrafted approach since the TCNN architecture is compact regarding the number of layers and connections.

306,306,MALP: A more effective meta-paths based link prediction method in partially aligned heterogeneous social networks,"In general, online social networks include different types of nodes and edges, which means that online social networks are a type of heterogeneous information network. Link prediction is a very important research problem in heterogeneous social networks. The solution to this problem is generally to predict the possibility of a link between two nodes by extracting the characteristics of the nodes in the network. However, the information provided by a single network may not be sufficient, so useful information can be passed from other networks to assist in link prediction in the target network. This is called a partially aligned heterogeneous social network link prediction problem. In this paper, a method, called Meta-path and AUC optimization based Link Predictor(MALP), is proposed to predict the social links in the partially aligned social networks at the same time with a semi-supervised AUC optimization technology.

Three major approaches have been proposed to score such links relying on correlation measures, mutual information metrics, and regression algorithms. In this paper we present a new family of data-driven inference approaches, inspired on the regression based family, and based on classification algorithms.

In this paper, we study a novel transfer learning problem termed Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL) for Re-ID task. Different from existing transfer learning problems which assume that there is a close relation between source domain and target domain, in the DDTL problem, target domain can be totally different from source domain. For example, the source domain classifies pedestrian images but the target domain distinguishes vehicle images. In this work, our goal is to execute an unseen and unrelated task based on a labeled dataset training previously without any samples from intermediate domains. Particularly, we consider the more pragmatic issue of learning a deep feature with no labels, and propose a Deep Unsupervised Progressive Learning (DUPL) method to transfer pretrained deep representations to unseen domains. Specifically, our work performs clustering and fine-tuning of the CNN to improve the performance of original model trained on the irrelevant labeled dataset. Empirical studies on distant domain adaptation task (pedestrian -> vehicle) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the improvement in terms of the mAP accuracy is up to 15% over 'non-transfer' methods.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.75,0.018333333333333333,0.445,1

However, it is not clear whether the symptoms that a patient experiences, are solely side effects of a particular treatment (or a combination of them), or there are other confounding factors influencing them. In this work, we characterize the reported symptoms along with their severity for patients, based on their past interactions with various treatments and their pre-existing medical conditions. We analyze a large dataset from a symptoms tracking app, and observe a strong correlation between a patient's existing health condition(s) and the symptoms he or she experiences across different treatments. We develop a multi-objective neural network with gating mechanism, to predict the possible symptoms and their overall severity level for a set of treatments, for a given patient. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over state-of-the-art approaches.

310,310,Agnostic local explanation for time series classification,"Recent advances in Machine Learning (such as Deep Learning) have brought tremendous gains in classification accuracy. However, these approaches build complex non-linear models, making the resulting predictions difficult to interpret for humans. The field of model interpretability has therefore recently emerged, aiming to address this issue by designing methods to explain a posteriori the predictions of complex learners. Interpretability frameworks such as LIME and SHAP have been proposed for tabular, image and text data. Nowadays, with the advent of the Internet of Things and of pervasive monitoring, time-series have become ubiquitous and their classification is a crucial task in many application domains. Like in other data domains, state-of-the-art time-series classifiers rely on complex models and typically do not provide intuitive and easily interpretable outputs, yet no interpretability framework had so far been proposed for this type of data. In this paper, we propose the first agnostic Local Explainer For TIme Series classificaTion (LEFTIST). LEFTIST provides explanations for predictions made by any time series classifier. Our thorough experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the explanations provided by LEFTIST are at once faithful to the classification model and understandable by human users.",60030553,Universite de Rennes 1,Rennes,France,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",21.333333333333332,0.0011363636363636387,0.524621212121212,1

312,312,Improving Editorial Workflow and Metadata Quality at Springer Nature,"Identifying the research topics that best describe the scope of a scientific publication is a crucial task for editors, in particular because the quality of these annotations determine how effectively users are able to discover the right content in online libraries. For this reason, Springer Nature, the world’s largest academic book publisher, has traditionally entrusted this task to their most expert editors. These editors manually analyse all new books, possibly including hundreds of chapters, and produce a list of the most relevant topics. Hence, this process has traditionally been very expensive, time-consuming, and confined to a few senior editors. For these reasons, back in 2016 we developed Smart Topic Miner (STM), an ontology-driven application that assists the Springer Nature editorial team in annotating the volumes of all books covering conference proceedings in Computer Science. Since then STM has been regularly used by editors in Germany, China, Brazil, India, and Japan, for a total of about 800 volumes per year. Over the past three years the initial prototype has iteratively evolved in response to feedback from the users and evolving requirements. In this paper we present the most recent version of the tool and describe the evolution of the system over the years, the key lessons learnt, and the impact on the Springer Nature workflow. In particular, our solution has drastically reduced the time needed to annotate proceedings and significantly improved their discoverability, resulting in 9.3 million additional downloads.

Central to this endeavor is the problem of partitioning the set of agents into exhaustive and disjoint coalitions so as to maximize social welfare. The coalition structure generation problem is challenging due to the fact that it needs to explore an exponential number of partitions. The fastest exact algorithm to solve this combinatorial optimization problem is ODP-IP [1], which is a hybrid version of two previously established algorithms, namely IDP (Improved Dynamic Programming [2] and IP [3]. Given this, it is desirable to come up with a new algorithm which could build on the same principles as IDP follows and which in turn, improves upon the state.

In this paper, we introduce a new deep reinforcement learning architecture with model-based acceleration to optimize hyperparameters for any machine learning model. In this method, an agent constructed by a Long Short-Term Memory Network aims at maximizing the expected accuracy of a machine learning model on a validation set. To speed up training, we employ a model to predict the accuracy on a validation set instead of evaluating a machine learning model. To effectively train the agent and the predictive model, Real-Predictive-Real training process is proposed. Besides, to reduce the variance, we propose a bootstrap pool to guide the exploration in the search space.

Under our assumption, it is not practical to train each video with all the extracted frames as input because it can cause building a huge model. Hence, we created a median filter layer for reducing the number of frames before training. In the experiment, we extracted 500 frame images from each video. In the reduction process with a median filter layer, we were able to reduce the number of frames from 500 frame images to 50 median images.

Lifelong learning approaches aim to enable agents to retain the knowledge they learn and to selectively transfer knowledge to new tasks. Recent techniques for lifelong reinforcement learning have shown great success in getting an agent to generalise over several tasks. However, scalability becomes an issue when agents learn numerous tasks, as each task's information must be remembered. To address this issue, this paper proposes the approach of Variational Policy Chaining (VPC) which enables a reinforcement learning agent to generalise effectively in a scalable manner when presented with continuous task updates, without storing multiple historic experiences. VPC uses Kullback-Leibler divergence based method to isolate the most common pieces of knowledge, and condenses the important knowledge into a single policy chain. We evaluate VPC in a GridWorld environment and compare it to vanilla policy gradient methods, showing that VPC's ability to reuse knowledge from previously encountered tasks reduces learning time in new tasks by up to 50%.",60011149,Trinity College Dublin,Dublin,Ireland,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",25.428571428571427,0.1564110492681921,0.42214491857349,1

Inspired by recent advances in the use of complex networks for single-label learning, this exploratory work aims to investigate a multi-label solution able to combine existing multi-label classifiers with a high-level classifier based on complex networks measures, aiming to present a new concept of multi-label classification that, besides the physical attributes, also analyzes the topological structure of the data.

Such learning strategy has only been validated in single-agent scenarios where the environment is perceived through raw images. FIFA, in spite of being a successful soccer simulation video game representing a very realistic and challenging case study, has been relatively poorly explored in the context of Machine Learning research. Then, the main objective of the present work is to investigate the efficacy of DAI to cope with single and multi-agents FIFA platforms in which the environment is represented either by Object Detection Techniques (ODT) or by raw images. The agents were evaluated in terms of the rate of goals obtained in the free-kicks scenarios provided by FIFA. The results show that DAI performs well on both the single and multi-agent based platforms. Further, the raw image based technique proved to be better than the ODT based method to represent the environment.",60015104,Universidade Federal de Uberlandia,Uberlandia,Brazil,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",23.125,-0.020766413074105393,0.42349253310791773,1
324,324,Collision-free path finding for dynamic gaming and real time robot navigation,"Collision-free path finding is crucial for multi-agent traversing environments like gaming systems. An efficient and accurate technique is proposed for avoiding collisions with potential obstacles in virtual and real time environments. Potential field is a coherent technique but it eventuates with various problems like static map usage and pre-calculated potential field map of the environment. It is unsuitable for dynamically changing or unknown environments. Agents can get stuck inside a local minima incompetent in escaping without a workaround implementation. This paper presents efficient and accurate solutions to find collision free path using potential field for dynamic gaming and real time robot navigation. A surfing game in two testing environments with a Gamecar and a physical robot called Robocar is created with dynamic and solid obstacles. Sensor like proximity, line and ultrasonic are used along with the camera as different agents for path finding. The proposed intelligent agent (IA) technique is compared with other path planing algorithms and games in terms of time complexity, cost metrics, decision making complexity, action repertoire, interagent communication, reactivity and temporally continuous. It traverses for 135 meters(m) in 55.8 seconds(s) covering 20 goals and 419.3 m in 8.7 minutes while avoiding 10 local minimas successfully. Proposed technique shows comparable results to path finding with techniques using neural networks and A∗ algorithm.

327,327,Random walk-based top-k tag generation in bipartite networks of entity-term type,"Tag generation aims to find relevant tags for a given entity, which has numerous applications, such as classification, information retrieval and recommender system. Practically, the data of real applications is sparse and lacks sufficient description for entities, which might lead to incomprehensive results. Random walk with restart (RWR) can find the hidden relationship between nodes by utilizing indirect connections. However, the traditional RWR computation is based on the whole structure of the given network, which maintains a matrix for storing all relevances between nodes. And the efficiency problem would be run into as network grows large. In this paper, we propose a top-k tag generation algorithm, namely DRWR, for efficiently generating the tags from entity-term network. The terms are treated as candidate tags, and the most relevant terms are treated as the tags for a given entity. The relevance computation between entity and terms is divided into two stages: Off-line stage and on-line stage. In off-line stage, the relevances between terms are computed over the term-term network that is built based on the whole structure of entity-term network. In on-line stage, the relevances between entity and each term are computed based on the relevances between terms. For supporting fast on-line query processing, we develop a pruning algorithm, which skips the operations on relevances between terms smaller than a threshold.

In practice, there exist many confusing charges which result in the decline of LJP performance of the existing works. To address this issue, we introduce the legal constitutive elements as the discriminative features to distinguish confusing charges. We propose an element-driven attentive neural network model, EDA-NN, which takes the textual description of a criminal case as the input and learns both element-free and element-aware case representations. Moreover, the element-driven attention mechanism is incorporated with the hierarchical sequence encoders, to generate crucial representations oriented to the legal constitutive elements at both the word and sentence levels. With the concatenation of element-free and element-aware representations, the EDA-NN can jointly predict the legal constitutive elements and judgment results.

In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction framework for video-based person re-identification, namely, the partial attribute-driven network (PADNet). The proposed method is based on the deep-learning architecture and incorporates the attribute and identity learning of the pedestrian. Existing attribute research always focuses on the feature representation at the global-level. Unlike them, first, the pedestrian is automatically partitioned to several body parts in our work. Then the pedestrian and his/her body parts are annotated by the global and partial attributes, respectively. Finally, we employ a four-branch multi-label network to explore the spatial-temporal cues of videos by utilizing these labeled samples.

330,330,Texture recognition on metal surface using order-less scale invariant GLAC,"Inspection of metal surface textures using computer vision and machine learning techniques plays an important role in Automated Visual Inspection (AVI) systems. Texture recognition on metal surface is challenging because the characteristics of each texture type are dependent on the properties of the metal surface when captured under different lighting conditions. Since these textures have no obvious repetitive patterns like general textures, this results in high intra-class diversities. Prior knowledge has shown that surface properties such as surface curvature and depth are discriminant to different texture types on metal surface. Since scale, shapes and location of textures within the same type are not fixed, scale property and spatial ordering information are less important for differentiating between texture types. There-fore, surface property, scale invariance and order-less property should be considered when exploring a suitable image feature for metal surface texture recognition. This paper proposes Order-less Scale Invariant Gradient Local Auto-Correlation (OS-GLAC) which meets all three requirements for robust texture recognition. The experiment results show that OS-GLAC is robust to separate different metal surface texture types. In addition, we observed that OS-GLAC is not only useful for texture recognition on metal surface but also for general texture recognition when combined with pre-trained deep learning features as these two features capture complimentary information. The experiment results show that such a combination of OS-GLAC achieves competitive results on three well-established general texture datasets i.e., KTH-TIP-2a, KTH-TIPS-2b and FMD.",60118946,Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate Lab,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",23.4,0.09173333333333333,0.46526666666666666,1
331,331,Real-coded genetic algorithm realizing fast convergence by reducing its population size,"Just generation gap (JGG) is a generational alternation model of real-coded genetic algorithms (GAs), and is excellent at finding the global optimum solution of a function optimization problem. However, its population size is large, and therefore its convergence speed is low. A method to accelerate the convergence speed is to reduce the population size. However, if it is reduced throughout the search by JGG, the population diversity is lost, which may cause the failure to find the global optimum solution. The population size should be reduced during only a part of the search period during which the population diversity is not lost. In this paper, we propose a real-coded GA realizing fast convergence by introducing the reduction of the population size into JGG. In the proposed method, the population size is reduced during only an early or late search period. The performance of the proposed method is empirically evaluated by comparing it with only JGG and an existing GA.",60031225,Kyoto Institute of Technology,Kyoto,Japan,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",19.875,0.15984126984126987,0.5619047619047618,1

In particular, we integrate centrality-based heuristics into the search-based exact model counter sharpSAT. Our experiments show that employing centrality information significantly improves the empirical performance of sharpSAT, and also allows for simplifying the search heuristics compared to the current default heuristics of the model counter. In particular, we show that the VSIDS heuristic, which is an integral search heuristic employed in essentially all state-of-the-art conflict-driven clause learning Boolean satisfiability solvers, appears to be of very limited use in the context of model counting.",60002952,Helsingin Yliopisto,Helsinki,Finland,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",26.2,0.13965201465201466,0.41749084249084256,1

Nonetheless, due to the intrinsic difficulty associated with large-scale RGB-D data capture for training purpose and the inefficient utilization of existing training datasets, it is still challenging to accommodate flexibly-changing scenarios. To ameliorate, we propose a fewshot learning method for monocular depth estimation augmented by local object-object relationship. Our method is based on the insight that the depth changing between neighboring objects is relatively stable across diverse but similar scenarios. At the technical front, we first learn the object relationship based on the relative distance between single objects. Towards this goal, we design a CNN architecture to simultaneously encode the object spatial context into object-object relationship features and encode the original image into global context features. Hence we can complementally leverage few-shot dataset with only a few samples for depth estimation while preserving the global depth changing range and respecting the local object-object depth details. As a result, our novel approach could estimate depth from various indoor RGB images, which greatly alleviates the training dataset dependency in monocular depth estimation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations on the widely-used public benchmarks, and all the experiments confirm that, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art depth estimation methods, especially for the cases where only smallscale training samples are available.",60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.444444444444443,0.11648351648351649,0.39702380952380956,1

Arabic is considered to be an under-resourced language, has many dialects, and rich in morphology. Combined together, these challenges make identifying semantically similar questions in Arabic even more difficult. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to tackle this problem and test it on two benchmarks; one for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and another for the 24 major Arabic dialects. We are able to show that our new system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving 93% F1-score on the MSA benchmark and 82% on the dialectical one. This is achieved by utilizing contextualized word representations (ELMo embeddings) trained on a text corpus containing MSA and dialectic sentences. This in combination with a pairwise fine-grained similarity layer, helps our question-to-question model to generalize on dialects while being trained only on our newly developed question-to-question MSA data.",124007331,Mawdoo3 Ltd,Amman,Jordan,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",23.714285714285715,0.1739183501683502,0.5238636363636364,1

However, for large-scale problems with high-dimensional features solving sparse SVMs remains a challenging problem, and most of the existing work are heuristic in that there are no performance guarantees and can't effectively control the trade-off between the sparsity and the accuracy of the decision hyperplane. To address this issue, we propose a new method for via relaxation and rounding, which obtains (ϵ,δ-approximate solution in Õ(n/ϵδ) time with probability at least 1-δ. Such regularization explicitly penalizes parameters different from zero with no further restrictions. We first show that learning sparse SVMs with ℓ-0 norm can be reformulated as an exactly Boolean program by introducing Boolean variables to each parameter. With dual and Boolean relaxation, this Boolean problem can be relaxed as a convex programming. For the ϵ-approximate solution of this convex programming, we get a feasible solution of the original problem without loss accuracy by a determined rounding. We analyze the proposed method in details and give a provable guarantee which is missing from the previous work.

336,336,Exploring numerical calculations with CalcNet,"Neural networks are not great generalizers outside their training range i.e. they are good at capturing bias but might miss the overall concept. Important issues with neural networks is that when testing data goes outside training range they fail to predict accurate results. Hence, they loose the ability to generalize a concept. For systematic numeric exploration neural accumulators (NAC) and neural arithmetic logic unit(NALU) are proposed which performs excellent for simple arithmetic operations. But, major limitation with these units is that they can't handle complex mathematical operations \& equations. For example, NALU can predict accurate results for multiplication operation but not for factorial function which is essentially composition of multiplication operations only. It is unable to comprehend pattern behind an expression when composition of operations are involved. Hence, we propose a new neural network structure effectively which takes in complex compositional mathematical operations and produces best possible results with small NALU based neural networks as its pluggable modules which evaluates these expression at unitary level in a bottom-up manner. We call this effective neural network as CalcNet, as it helps in predicting accurate calculations for complex numerical expressions even for values that are out of training range. As part of our study we applied this network on numerically approximating complex equations, evaluating biquadratic equations and tested reusability of these modules. We arrived at far better generalizations for complex arithmetic extrapolation tasks as compare to both only NALU layer based neural networks and simple feed forward neural networks. Also, we achieved even better results for our golden ratio based modified NAC and NALU structures for both interpolating and extrapolating tasks in all evaluation experiments.

Three deep learning algorithms were experimented, namely GRU, LSTM and BLSTM. Data pre-processing steps, including oversampling were performed on the selected social media datasets.

For more accurate results, 10-fold cross-validation technique was implemented. The experimental results show that BLSTM performs best with ELMO in detecting cyberbullying texts. The efficiency of each model is also measured by calculating the average time taken for training each model. GRU outperforms in terms of time efficiency.

In contrast with currently predominant conversational agents, whose intelligence derives from dialogue trees and external modules, a fully autonomous domestic or workplace robot must carry out more complex reasoning. Such a robot must make good decisions as soon as possible, learn from experience, respond to feedback, and rely on feedback only as much as necessary. In this research, we narrow the focus of a hypothetical robot assistant to a room-tidying task in a simulated domestic environment. Given an item, the robot chooses where to put it among many destinations, then optionally receives feedback from a human operator. We frame the problem as a contextual bandit, a reinforcement learning approach frequently used in Web recommendation systems. We evaluate epsilon-greedy and LinUCB action selection methods under a variety of infrequent feedback scenarios, with several methods for managing the lack of feedback.

343,343,Mobile robot routing with energy consumption optimization," Publication rights licensed to ACM.We consider scheduling mobile robots which are used to carry materials for intelligent manufacturing. Battery-powered mobile robots transport materials from warehouse to a set of demand points, and their power varies during a trip as the weight of loads varies whenever unloading some materials at a demand point. In most of literature about vehicle routing problems, researchers only consider minimizing travel distance, without explicitly considering the effect of different loads on the energy consumption, which is critical for many real world applications. To address this problem, we develop an innovative mixed integer linear programming model for scheduling robots with energy consumption optimization. Numerical results show that our model can significantly reduce energy consumption with slightly increased traveling distance, comparing with the traditional routing models which just minimize the total travel distance. The model can also accurately predict the energy consumption of trips in serving demand points, hence increasing the reliability of scheduling and reducing the times of charging. The results demonstrate the importance of considering energy consumption in some scheduling problems where the weight variation of loads cannot be ignored.

345,345,A novel method to enhance recommendation systems via leveraging multiple types of implicit feedbacks,"Recommendation system is one of the most widely applied information filtering techniques. In recent years, more and more studies on recommendation systems have shifted from explicit behaviors to implicit behaviors. Although a lot of existing implicit recommendation systems have been proven to have excellent performance, these implicit recommendation systems have two major issues. First, most of studies only consider to utilize one implicit behavior (e.g. click / no click) to learn user preference and help improve recommendation performance. Second, almost all studies neglect the important role of co-occurrence among different implicit behaviors. In this paper, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel implicit recommendation model Bayesian Personalized Ranking by leveraging Multiple types of Implicit Feedbacks (BPR-MIF), which can distinguish user's favorite degree and make full use of user behaviors. We further leverage the significant role of co-occurrence to highlight implicit behavior combinations that better reflect user preference. In addition, an effective objective function which is suitable for multiple types of implicit behaviors recommendation systems is adopted in our model. And we extend the usage of co-occurrence to a specific item. Ultimately, extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets, including Retailrocket, Douban Book and Jobs datasets.

347,347,TMRM: Two-stage multi-task recommendation model boosted feature selection,"For recommendation systems, full learning from features is critical to improving system accuracy. Most recommendation systems collect a large number of features to improve the recommendation accuracy, but they ignore the importance of extracting important feature combinations. Even if some systems manually measure important features based on experience, they cannot automatically select important feature combinations, that is why they can not be used to guide model training. In this paper, a Two-stage Multi-task Recommendation Model(TMRM) is proposed which aims to automatically select important feature combinations from massive features, and it also contributes to achieving better recommendations through a combination of tree-based model and neural network. Extensive experiments on two large public data sets are conducted on TMRM, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art solutions on performance of recommendation systems.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",27.0,0.2598901098901099,0.6620879120879122,1

One common characteristic of the credit dataset is the imbalance between good and bad applicants, with low defaults (no paid loans). Ensemble classification methodology is widely used in this field. However, dynamic ensemble selection approaches to imbalanced datasets have drawn little consideration. This study aims to adapt KNORA-Union, an excellent dynamic selection technique, to imbalanced credit scoring problem, the KNORAImbalanced Union (KNORA-IU). In this approach, we propose a new procedure to evaluate the competence of each base classifier. The results, based on four performance measures, indicate that the performance of the KNORA-IU is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches for moderate imbalanced datasets.",60085207,Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione A.

349,349,A robust single-sensor face and iris biometric identification system based on multimodal feature extraction network,"Joint face-iris identification can integrate complementary information from face and iris to fulfill the requirement of performance improvement and security. However, most of the current face-iris multimodal biometric systems acquire face and iris with different sensors which brings about the increase of capturing complexity and device cost. Besides, they are limited by the identification performance degradation under non-ideal scenarios. In order to address these problems, a robust single-sensor face and iris biometric identification system based on multimodal feature extraction (MFE) network is proposed. Only a single sensor is needed to obtain face and iris images in the proposed system, with the goal of improving recognition performance while minimizing sensor cost and acquisition time. The MFE network is designed as a general network module to extract both face and iris features and it is trained with a triplet framework to reduce intra-class variations and enlarge inter-class variations. Our experimental results on CASIA.v4-distance and FRGC v2.0 non-ideal datasets show that the proposed system achieves better identification performance in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER) and False Reject Rate (FFR), etc. compared with other unimodal and multimodal biometric systems.",60014966,Peking University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",23.25,0.04017857142857142,0.4568452380952381,1

Existing online kernel selection approaches via expert advice and classical adversarial bandit model can not meet the issue. In this work, we propose a novel grouped adversarial bandit solution to the problem. We first correspond each candidate kernel to a basic arm of an adversarial bandit problem. Then, all of the kernels are divided into several groups where each group is abstracted as a super arm. At each round, we choose a super arm and a basic kernel within the selected super arm, and make prediction by an online kernel learning algorithm. Besides, we introduce a Bernoulli random variable to decide whether to choose all of the rest super arms. Theoretical analysis shows the proposed approach balances the regret and the time complexity explicitly, which could enjoy better pseudo-regret and high probability regret bound than classical adversarial bandit model and lighter time complexity than expert advice model.

Time optimal velocity control can be solved numerically using existing methods that are based on optimal control and vehicle dynamics. In this paper, we use deep reinforcement learning to generate the time optimal velocity control. Furthermore, we use the numerical solution to further improve the performance of the reinforcement learner.

Therefore, researchers are discovering ways to reduce the cost while achieving variable speed control. One way is by getting rid of speed sensor in the motor shaft. It can reduce program complexity and improve reliability while minimizing the cost. The recent trend in the sensorless control of induction motor drive is to achieve successful reference tracking of estimated speed at low or zero speed. The vector control due to decoupled control of stator flux and rotor torque in induction motor is widely applied for speed control. In this paper, a sensorless vector control of induction motor with fuzzy-based rotor-flux MRAS topology is proposed. The fuzzy logic controller in the speed estimator block has achieved tremendous improvement in the speed estimation at low and even zero speed proving it to be superior to other sensorless control methods.

Consequently, it is well adapted to the context of drift detection in data stream problems.

In some applications, sensors measure the environment while ML algorithms are responsible for interpreting the data. These systems often face three main restrictions: Power consumption, cost, and lack of infrastructure. Therefore, we need highly-efficient classifiers suitable to execute in unresourceful hardware. However, this scenario conflicts to the state-of-practice of ML, in which classifiers are frequently implemented in high-level interpreted languages, make unrestricted use of floating-point operations and assume plenty of resources. In this paper, we present a software tool named EmbML that implements a pipeline to develop classifiers for low-powered embedded systems. It starts with learning a classifier using popular software packages or libraries. Then, EmbML converts the classifier into a carefully crafted C++ code with support for embedded hardware.

This problem can be viewed as a Markov Decision Process. Therefore, under determinate conditions of the motion path, we make the attempt of applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the motion coordination problems. In this paper, in order to make this problem solvable through RL methods, we design a Path Checkerboard Diagram (PCD) to represent the collision relationship among different paths and determine whether collisions occur when the agent takes action. Technically, we design the states, actions and reward function. However, the traditional Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm has the problem of overestimation of state-action values and high approximation error variance of the target values. To fit the motion coordination problem scenario, we further propose a new algorithm Multi-Loss Double DQN (MLDDQN) based on the Double DQN (DDQN), which minimizes the weighted sum of loss of different target networks we have learned before. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through the different motion coordination tasks.

358,358,QaldGen: Towards Microbenchmarking of Question Answering Systems over Knowledge Graphs,"Over the last years, a number of Knowledge Graph (KG) based Question Answering (QA) systems have been developed. Consequently, the series of Question Answering Over Linked Data (QALD1–QALD9) challenges and other datasets have been proposed to evaluate these systems. However, the QA datasets contain a fixed number of natural language questions and do not allow users to select micro benchmarking samples of the questions tailored towards specific use-cases. We propose QaldGen, a framework for microbenchmarking of QA systems over KGs which is able to select customised question samples from existing QA datasets. The framework is flexible enough to select question samples of varying sizes and according to the user-defined criteria on the most important features to be considered for QA benchmarking. This is achieved using different clustering algorithms. We compare state-of-the-art QA systems over knowledge graphs by using different QA benchmarking samples. The observed results show that specialised micro-benchmarking is important to pinpoint the limitations of the various QA systems and its components.

This study focuses on a new type of challenging short text classification task - sentiment-aware Danmaku classification to understand the user's opinion through collective intelligence. Currently, Convolutional neural network(CNN) and Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network-based models have poor performance in the classification of Danmaku due to the ignoration of the word's position information in a sentence and data sparsity problem. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Attention and CNN based sentiment-aware short text classifier to advance the state-of-the-art of short-text classification. Firstly, we define a classification criterion of Danmaku intent with six categories, considering three polarities of sentiment and two language types. Then, by introducing the attention mechanism to the Bi-LSTM based model, in which the position information is preserved during training, we realize accurate Danmaku sentiment classification and generate the sentiment embedding. Lastly, to achieve accurate sentiment-aware Danmaku intent classification, a sentiment Embedding with Channel-attention Layer is introduced to a CNN based sentence classifier using the generated Danmaku sentiment embedding. Experiment results show that the Attention and Bi-LSTM based Danmaku sentiment classifier achieves a sentiment classification accuracy of 76%. Furthermore, compared with baseline models, our proposed intent classifier delivers superior performance in classifying the six intents of Danmaku.

361,361,Ensemble multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for gene regulatory network reconstruction based on fuzzy cognitive maps," All Rights Reserved.Many methods aim to use data, especially data about gene expression based on high throughput genomic methods, to identify complicated regulatory relationships between genes. The authors employ a simple but powerful tool, called fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), to accurately reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Many automated methods have been carried out for training FCMs from data. These methods focus on simulating the observed time sequence data, but neglect the optimisation of network structure. In fact, the FCM learning problem is multi-objective which contains network structure information, thus, the authors propose a new algorithm combining ensemble strategy and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), called EMOEAFCM-GRN, to reconstruct GRNs based on FCMs. In EMOEAFCM-GRN, the MOEA first learns a series of networks with different structures by analysing historical data simultaneously, which is helpful in finding the target network with distinct optimal local information. Then, the networks which receive small simulation error on the training set are selected from the Pareto front and an efficient ensemble strategy is provided to combine these selected networks to the final network. The experiments on the DREAM4 challenge and synthetic FCMs illustrate that EMOEAFCM-GRN is efficient and able to reconstruct GRNs accurately.",60025578,Xidian University,Xi'an,China,"['1702', '1709', '1707', '1705', '1710']",24.625,0.12919786096256686,0.5515699006875476,0

In an earlier work, adopting the general notion of value of information (VoI) first introduced by Krause and Guestrin, Ghosh and Ramakrishnan considered the problem of determining optimal conditional observation plans in temporal graphical models, based on non-myopic (non-greedy) VoI, over a finite time horizon. They cast the problem as determining optimal policies in finite-horizon, non-discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, there are many practical scenarios where a time horizon is undefinable. In this paper, we consider the VoI optimization problem over an infinite (or equivalently, undefined) time horizon. Adopting an approach similar to Ghosh and Ramakrishnan's, we cast this problem as determining optimal policies in infinite-horizon, finite-state, discounted MDPs. Although our MDP-based framework addresses Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) that are more restricted than those addressed by Ghosh and Ramakrishnan, we incorporate Krause and Guestrin's general idea of VoI even though it was fundamentally envisioned for finite-horizon settings.

In our algorithm, multiple different policies train simultaneously and each of them controls several identical agents that interact with environments. Actions are sampled by each policy separately as usual, but the trajectories for the training process are collected from all agents, instead of only one policy.

Although incident rates are high, a clear understanding of the disease is missing. CP is characterized by several motor disorders and sensory or perceptive comorbidities. This multifaceted nature complicates proper diagnosis and hampers the search for possible treatments. During adolescence and adulthood, individuals with CP experience a drastic deterioration in gross motor control, independence, and quality of life. There is poor evidence that physical therapy promotes the retention of function through aging, and no clinical studies exist that explore the potential of VR-based training to prevent deterioration. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, we expose 14 adults with CP to the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS) and examine its usability, effectiveness, and acceptability. Our results show that the RGS difficulty adaptation algorithm automatically matches the patients' impairment level as captured by clinical scales (Barthel and Box & Blocks).

However, up to now, it is still difficult for the traditional image processing methods to detect and distinguish objects which we want to detect in X-Ray baggage security imagery. Moreover, it is even more challenging to classify different types of objects. Although the current state-of-the-art detectors have achieved impressive performance on various public datasets with visible images, these detectors fail to deal with objects in X-ray images. This paper proposes an object detection algorithm for X-Ray baggage security screening images. Firstly, to outline the detected object from X-Ray baggage security imagery, we propose a fore-ground-background segmentation method which based on color information. Then, to classify and outline different type of object in X-Ray im-age, a deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based object detection framework Faster R-CNN are proposed. In this stage we also use transfer learning method to speed up Faster R-CNN. The proposed method is proved to achieve 77% mAP by in a real-word dataset which contains 32,253 sub-way X-Ray baggage security screening images.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",20.22222222222222,0.128125,0.575,1

Each such dataset contains billions of triples extracted from millions of documents crawed from hundreds of domains. While these datasets were originally motivated by the annual ISWC competition from which they take their name, they would become widely used in other contexts, forming a key resource for a variety of research works concerned with managing and/or analysing diverse, real-world RDF data as found natively on the Web. Given that the last BTC dataset was published in 2014, we prepare and publish a new version – BTC-2019 – containing 2.2 billion quads parsed from 2.6 million documents on 394 pay-level-domains. This paper first motivates the BTC datasets with a survey of research works using these datasets. Next we provide details of how the BTC-2019 crawl was configured. We then present and discuss a variety of statistics that aim to gain insights into the content of BTC-2019. We discuss the hosting of the dataset and the ways in which it can be accessed, remixed and used.

374,374,Random vector functional link with naive bayes for classification problems of mixed data,"A common approach to handle categorical attributes in neural networks is to use the one-hot encoding. Depending of the number of categorical attributes, and the number of levels that each one of these can have, will increase significantly the number of input nodes of a neural network. In this paper we analyze a type of randomized neural network called random vector functional link which has a non-iterative learning approach, in particular, it can be trained in one step. In order to avoid any time consuming preprocessing for categorical attributes, or increase the dimensionality of the input layer of the neural network, we propose a two-stage learning approach. In the first stage, we use the naive Bayes, that is also trained in one step, to compute the posterior probabilities for each class, using all the attributes. Then, in the second stage, we train a random vector functional link using as inputs the continuous attributes and including as additional hidden units the posterior probabilities obtained in the previous stage. We compare using benchmark datasets, the classification performance of the neural network with only continuous attributes versus the combination with naive Bayes to include the information of the categorical data.

375,375,An eigenvector-enhanced parallel adaptive differential evolution for electric motor design,"Differential Evolution (DE) is a well-known metaheuristic designed to solve continuous optimization problems. Its simple structure and straight forward search operators make it suitable for solving a wide range of real world problems. Despite its success, DE performance may be limited when tackling high dimensional complex problems. Therefore, its algorithmic structure can be reconsidered by adaptively controlling its parameters, and incorporating more resilient search operators. In this study, a Q-learning-based strategy is proposed to adapt DE parameters during the search process. Moreover, an eigenvector-based crossover is introduced in order to accelerate the convergence rate when ill-conditioned landscapes are treated. However, to avoid premature convergence, a simple yet efficient switching technique is proposed to choose between the normal and the eigenvector-based crossover. Due to the high computational time that might occur when applying the eigenvector-based crossover, a parallel counterpart of the algorithm has been implemented using graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed algorithm has been applied to find the optimal mechanical structure of a recent electric motor. Its performance has been also validated by testing the proposal on CEC 2011 test suite, which contains a set of real world problems. The experimental results reveal the competetive performance of our algorithm compared to recent adaptive DE versions.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown its power in image recognition task. While in the field of video recognition, it is still a challenge problem. In this paper, we introduce a high-efficient attention-based convolutional network named ECPNet for video understanding. ECPNet adopts the framework that is a consecutive connection of 2D CNN and pseudo-3D CNN. The pseudo-3D means we replace the traditional 3 × 3 × 3 kernel with two 3D convolutional filters shaped 1 × 3 × 3 and 3 × 1 × 1. Our ECPNet combines the advantages of both 2D and 3D CNNs: (1) ECPNet is an end-to-end network and can learn information of appearance from images and motion between frames. (2) ECPNet requires less computing resource and lower memory consumption than many state-of-art models. (3) ECPNet is easy to expand for different demands of runtime and classification accuracy.

377,377,Transfer learning with ensemble feature extraction and low-rank matrix factorization for severity stage classification of diabetic retinopathy,"The automatic classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is of vital importance, as it is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in the working-age population all over the world today. Current clinical approaches require a well-trained clinician to manually evaluate digital colour fundus photographs of retina and locate lesions associated with vascular abnormalities due to diabetes, which is time-consuming. Recently, deep feature extraction using pretrained convolutional neural networks has been used to predict DR from fundus images with reasonable accuracy. However, techniques such as global average pooling (GAP), singular value decomposition (SVD) and ensemble learning have not been used in automatic prediction of DR. We propose to use a combination of deep features produced by an ensemble of pretrained-CNNs (DenseNet-201, ResNet-18 and VGG-16) as a single feature vector to predict five-class severity levels of diabetic retinopathy. Our results show a promising F1-measure of over 98% on the kaggle dataset and another dataset provided to us by an ophthalmic clinic. This is an improvement on the current state-of-the-art approaches in DR classification. We evaluated prominent CNN architectures (DenseNet, ResNet, Xception, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2 and VGG) that can be used for the task of transfer learning for DR. Moreover, we describe a technique of reducing memory consumption and processing time whereas preserving classification accuracy by using dimensional reduction based on GAP and SVD.",60071105,University of Moratuwa,Moratuwa,Sri Lanka,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.444444444444443,0.04668367346938775,0.3992346938775511,1
378,378,Sparklify: A Scalable Software Component for Efficient Evaluation of SPARQL Queries over Distributed RDF Datasets,"One of the key traits of Big Data is its complexity in terms of representation, structure, or formats. One existing way to deal with it is offered by Semantic Web standards. Among them, RDF – which proposes to model data with triples representing edges in a graph – has received a large success and the semantically annotated data has grown steadily towards a massive scale. Therefore, there is a need for scalable and efficient query engines capable of retrieving such information. In this paper, we propose Sparklify: a scalable software component for efficient evaluation of SPARQL queries over distributed RDF datasets. It uses Sparqlify as a SPARQL-to-SQL rewriter for translating SPARQL queries into Spark executable code. Our preliminary results demonstrate that our approach is more extensible, efficient, and scalable as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Sparklify is integrated into a larger SANSA framework and it serves as a default query engine and has been used by at least three external use scenarios.

379,379,Triplet deep hashing with joint supervised loss for fast image retrieval,"In recent years, the emerging hashing techniques have been successful in large-scale image retrieval. Due to its strong learning ability, deep hashing has become one of the most promising solutions and achieved good results in practice. However, existing deep hashing methods had some limitations, for example, most methods consider only one kind of supervised loss, which leads to insufficient utilization of supervised information. To address this issue, we proposed a Triplet Deep Hashing method with Joint supervised Loss based on convolution neural network (JLTDH) in this work. The proposed JLTDH method combine triplet likelihood loss and linear classification loss, moreover, the triplet supervised label is adopted, which contains richer supervised information than that of pointwise and pairwise label. At the same time, in order to overcome the cubic increase in the number of triplets and make triplet training more effective, we adopt a novel triplet selection method. The whole process is divided into two stages, in the first stage, taking the triplets generated by the triplet selection method as the input of CNN, the three CNNs with shared weights are used for image feature learning, the last layer of the network outputs a preliminary hash code. In the second stage, relying on the hash code of the first stage and the joint loss function, the neural network model is further optimized so that the generated hash code has higher query precision. We perform extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and MS-COCO.

During recent years, explaining machine learning predictions is also a very hot topic. A lot of approaches have been proposed for explaining multi-class classifier predictions. However, almost nothing has been proposed for multi-label and ensemble approaches. This paper brings two main contributions. It first proposes a natural framework consisting in reasoning with base classifier explanations in order to provide explanations for the multi-label predictions. The second contribution focuses on binary relevance, a widely used approach in multi-label classification, and distinguishes two kinds of explanations: Common explanations shared by all base classifiers predicting positive labels and joint explanations combining explanations from each base classifier predicting a positive label. The paper proposes an efficient approach for deriving such explanations.

382,382,Reconciling feature-reuse and overfitting in DenseNet with specialized dropout,"Recently convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve great accuracy in visual recognition tasks. DenseNets become one of the most popular CNN models due to its effectiveness in the feature-reuse. However, like other CNN models, DenseNets also face the overfitting problem if not more severe. Existing dropout methods can be applied but not effective. In particular, the property of the feature-reuse in DenseNets will be impeded, and the dropout effect will be weakened by the spatial correlation inside feature maps. To address these problems, we craft the design of a specialized dropout method from three aspects, the dropout location, the dropout granularity, and the dropout probability. The insights attained here could potentially be applied as a general approach for boosting the accuracy of other CNN models with similar shortcut connections. Experimental results show that DenseNets with our specialized dropout method yield better accuracies compared to vanilla DenseNets and state-of-the-art CNN models, and such accuracy boost increases with the model depth.",60029241,"University of California, Santa Barbara",Santa Barbara,United States,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",19.75,0.1053921568627451,0.49754901960784315,1

We evaluate the performance of our proposed method through well-known classifiers that are commonly used in machine learning problems.

Most interestingly, doing so shows that the k-means algorithm, a staple of 'conventional'' or 'shallow'' machine learning, can actually be seen as a special case of deep learning, contrary to the general perception that deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Doing so also automatically introduces yet another unsupervised learning technique into the arsenal of deep learning, which happens to be an example of interpretable deep neural networks as well.

Reduction on hospital stay also reduces the risks of hospital-acquired infections. In this context, we tried to verify the impact of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and inference techniques in order to improve the diagnosis procedure. This paper presents METAPHOR (MultiagEnT Architecture POstoperative Referral) as an evolution of a previous proposed model applying machine learning classifier algorithms in order to indicate the best referral for postoperative patients based on on-line medical information.

This brings a lot of new issues worth studying and directions worth exploring. At the same time, there are many difficulties that need to be overcome. There are lot of challenges, such as lacking of effective deep learning models and being short of appropriate datasets. Inspired by the concept of density matrix in quantum mechanics, we propose a novel attention mechanism called DMATT and apply it to conversational sentiment analysis tasks. In the experiment, we find that deep learning model combined with DMATT has a great improvement in test results compared to the model with traditional attention mechanism. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) and their variants LSTM and GRU are very effective choices in solving time series problem such as conversational sentiment analysis tasks.

However, we are just beginning to understand the capabilities of neural learning in symbolic domains. Deep learning architectures that employ parameter sharing over graphs can produce models which can be trained on complex properties of relational data. These include highly relevant NP-Complete problems, such as SAT and TSP. In this work, we showcase how Graph Neural Networks (GNN) can be engineered - with a very simple architecture - to solve the fundamental combinatorial problem of graph colouring. Our results show that the model, which achieves high accuracy upon training on random instances, is able to generalise to graph distributions different from those seen at training time. Further, it performs better than the Neurosat, Tabucol and greedy baselines for some distributions. In addition, we show how vertex embeddings can be clustered in multidimensional spaces to yield constructive solutions even though our model is only trained as a binary classifier. In summary, our results contribute to shorten the gap in our understanding of the algorithms learned by GNNs, as well as hoarding empirical evidence for their capability on hard combinatorial problems.

With the rapid development of machine learning technologies, artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to classify DoS attacks. However, ANN models are vulnerable to adversarial samples: Inputs that are specially crafted to yield incorrect outputs. In this work, we explore a kind of DoS adversarial attacks which aim to bypass ANN-based DoS intrusion detection systems. By analyzing features of DoS samples, we propose an improved boundary-based method to craft adversarial DoS samples. The key idea is to optimize a Mahalanobis distance by perturbing continuous features and discrete features of DoS samples respectively. We experimentally study the effectiveness of our method in two trained ANN classifiers on KDDcup99 dataset and CICIDS2017 dataset.

Based on simple geometrical ideas, we introduce an algorithm that reweights the distance between a query sample and any positive training example. This leads to a modification of the Voronoi regions and thus of the decision boundaries of the NN algorithm. We provide a theoretical justification about the weighting scheme needed to reduce the False Negative rate while controlling the number of False Positives.

The tasks are reallocated according to the proximity of the resources and they are performed in accordance with the capabilities of the nodes in which agents are situated. This dynamic and on-going negotiation process takes place concurrently with the task execution and so the task allocation process is adaptive to disruptions (task consumption, slowing down nodes). We evaluate the strategy in a multi-agent deployment of the MapReduce design pattern for processing large datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our strategy significantly improves the overall runtime of the data processing.",60104665,University of Lille,Lille,France,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",21.666666666666668,0.06671626984126984,0.28239087301587307,1
392,392,Deep learning poison data attack detection,"Deep neural networks are widely used in many walks of life. Techniques such as transfer learning enable neural networks pre-trained on certain tasks to be retrained for a new duty, often with much less data. Users have access to both pre-trained model parameters and model definitions along with testing data but have either limited access to training data or just a subset of it. This is risky for system-critical applications, where adversarial information can be maliciously included during the training phase to attack the system. Determining the existence and level of attack in a model is challenging. In this paper, we present evidence on how adversarially attacking training data increases the boundary of model parameters using as an example of a CNN model and the MNIST data set as a test. This expansion is due to new characteristics of the poisonous data that are added to the training data. Approaching the problem from the feature space learned by the network provides a relation between them and the possible parameters taken by the model on the training phase.

With the support of the K-MEANS clustering algorithm, clustering results detailing problem states/situations and game outcomes relationships recorded in cases from the case base guide the execution of augmented reuse policies. These policies consider the game actions recorded in the retrieved cases in the selection of the clusters to be used. Then, the cases that belong to the selected clusters are used in the determination of which game action is reused as a solution to the current game problem situation. With this two-step reuse process, the proposed policies rely on the majority with clusters, the probability with clusters, the number of points won with clusters and the chance of victory with clusters. To evaluate these proposals, card-playing agents implemented with different reuse policies competed against each other in duplicated game matches where all of them played using the same set of cards.",60033356,Universidade Federal de Santa Maria,Santa Maria,Brazil,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",29.5,-0.26875,0.4166666666666667,1
394,394,Approximating learning curves for imbalanced big data with limited labels,"Labeling data for supervised learning can be an expensive task, especially when large amounts of data are required to build an adequate classifier. For most problems, there exists a point of diminishing returns on a learning curve where adding more data only marginally increases model performance. It would be beneficial to approximate this point for scenarios where there is a large amount of data available but only a small amount of labeled data. Then, time and resources can be spent wisely to label the sample that is required for acceptable model performance. In this study, we explore learning curve approximation methods on a big imbalanced dataset from the bioinformatics domain. We evaluate a curve fitting method developed on small data using an inverse power law model, and propose a new semi-supervised method to take advantage of the large amount of unlabeled data. We find that the traditional curve fitting method is not effective for large sample sizes, while the semi-supervised method more accurately identifies the point of diminishing returns.",60017606,Florida Atlantic University,Boca Raton,United States,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",24.142857142857142,0.1394938394938395,0.5417499167499169,1
395,395,Feature space regularization for person re-identification with one sample,"Few Shot Learning is a solution to relieve the huge annotation cost in Person Re-Identification. We concentrate on one sample setting in this work, where each identity has only one labeled sample along with many unlabeled samples. Training with one sample setting, the model is easily biased towards certain identities. Moreover, a reliable pseudo-label estimation scheme can greatly improve the final performance of the model. Targeting to solve the issues above, we propose two simple and effective solutions. (a) We design the Feature Space Regularization (FSR) Loss to adjust the distribution of samples in feature space. The FSR loss make the difference in distance of all labeled samples to unlabeled samples as small as possible. (b) We propose combining the Nearest Neighbor distance with inter-class distance to estimate pseudo-label for unlabeled data, which we called Joint-Distance. Notably, the Rank-1 accuracy of our method outperforms the state of the art method by a large margin of 12.1 points (absolute, i.e., 67.9% vs. 55.8%) on Market-1501, and 10.1 points (absolute, i.e., 58.9% vs. 48.8%) on DukeMTMC-reID, respectively.

396,396,Threshold based optimization of performance metrics with severely imbalanced big security data,"Proper evaluation of classifier predictive models requires the selection of appropriate metrics to gauge the effectiveness of a model's performance. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) has become the de facto standard metric for evaluating this classifier performance. However, recent studies have suggested that AUC is not necessarily the best metric for all types of datasets, especially those in which there exists a high or severe level of class imbalance. There is a need to assess which specific metrics are most beneficial to evaluate the performance of highly imbalanced big data. In this work, we evaluate the performance of eight machine learning techniques on a severely imbalanced big dataset pertaining to the cyber security domain. We analyze the behavior of six different metrics to determine which provides the best representation of a model's predictive performance. We also evaluate the impact that adjusting the classification threshold has on our metrics. Our results find that the C4.5N decision tree is the optimal learner when evaluating all presented metrics for severely imbalanced Slow HTTP DoS attack data. Based on our results, we propose that the use of AUC alone as a primary metric for evaluating highly imbalanced big data may be ineffective, and the evaluation of metrics such as F-measure and Geometric mean can offer substantial insight into the true performance of a given model.",60017606,Florida Atlantic University,Boca Raton,United States,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",25.0,0.15438405797101448,0.4260507246376811,1

Financial text materials, such as receipts, transcripts, identification documents, etc. often involve critical personal information. In many circumstances, these data reside in protected servers of different institutions and must not be transferred beyond the institutional firewall. The emerging technology of Federated Learning (FL) provides a data-secure way of uniting isolated datasets in model training. Using the FL framework, text recognition models can be trained with larger collection of image samples. In previous works, federated text recognition models only deal with single-character images and alpha-numeric corpus. Such models are not competent in industrial applications, especially in Chinese text recognition problems. In this paper, we apply federated learning with a deep convolutional network to perform variable-length text string recognition with a large corpus. In our experiments, we compared two prevalent federated learning frameworks, namely, Tensorflow Federated and PySyft. Results show that federated text recognition models can achieve similar or even higher accuracy than models trained on deep learning framework. On a 5-client distributed dataset, the best character accuracy is achieved by TFF at 49.20%.

This model is pre-trained on a large amount of general-domain documents by means of a self-learning task.

402,402,Cognitive-motor interaction during virtual reality trail making,"There is great interest in ecological virtual reality (VR-) based adaptations of traditional pen-and-paper neuropsychological tests. Such adaptations are designed to measure the same cognitive construct(s) as the original test but may also evaluate interactions between such constructs and other functions (e.g., motor), as occurs in daily life. Here we report on translation of the pen-and-paper Color Trails Test (CTT) to a VR-based head-mount device (HMD) implementation. Trails A is a measure of sustained attention, while Trails B measures divided attention. Participants were twenty-seven young (28.02±3.98 years) and twenty-nine middle-aged (55.41±6.60 years) healthy individuals. For young and middle-aged participants, respectively, mean VR-CTT Trails A completion times were 61.77 and 86.70 sec. Mean VR-CTT Trails B completion times were 113.25 and 154.00 sec, respectively. These completion times were significantly longer than those obtained for the pen-and-paper version (p<.001). The middle-aged group had longer completion times than young adults for both test formats (p<.001), with VR-CTT Trails B separating among the groups better than the corresponding pen-and-paper measure (p<.05). Supporting construct validity, completion times were correlated between pen-and-paper and VR-based versions (Trails A: r=.63; Trails B: r=.60, p's<.001). VR-CTT motor performance was evaluated by quantifying the deviation of the actual reaching trajectories from the hand trajectories predicted by the minimal jerk model. For both age groups, deviations were greater for Trails B relative to Trails A (p<.001), consistent with a potential effect of divided attention on motor planning and execution. In sum, our VR-based HMD implementation of the CTT assesses similar cognitive constructs to the original pen-and-paper test (construct validity). Further, as suggested by longer completion times and substantial impact of cognitive demands upon motor performance, this VR-CTT affords enhanced ecological validity and added value by capturing cognitive-motor interactions associated with planning and execution of voluntary reaching movements during the task. We believe that such VR-based adaptations lie at the frontier of neuropsychological testing and will ultimately offer novel insights into our understanding of multimodal human function in the real world.",60011766,Chaim Sheba Medical Center Israel,Tel Aviv-Yafo,Israel,['1705'],21.933333333333334,0.11928571428571429,0.48428571428571426,1

Previous studies in this field focus on what has been changed due to bug-fixes, such as in terms of code edit actions. However, such studies did not consider where the bug-fix change was made (i.e., the context of the change), but knowing about the context can potentially narrow the search space for many software engineering techniques (e.g., by focusing mutation only on specific parts of the software). Furthermore, most previous work on bug-fixing changes focused on C and Java projects, but there is little empirical evidence about Python software. Therefore, in this paper we perform a thorough empirical analysis of bug-fixing changes in three OpenStack projects, focusing on both the what and the where of the changes.

406,406,Back to Basics - Redefining Quality Measurement for Hybrid Software Development Organizations,"As the software industry transitions from a license-based model to a subscription-based Software-as-aService (SaaS) model, many software development groups are using a hybrid development model that incorporates Agile and Waterfall methodologies in different parts of the organization. The traditional metrics used for measuring software quality in Waterfall or Agile paradigms do not apply to this new hybrid methodology. In addition, to respond to higher quality demands from customers and to gain a competitive advantage in the market, many companies are starting to prioritize quality as a strategic differentiator. As a result, quality metrics are included in the decision-making activities all the way up to the executive level, including Board of Director reviews. This paper presents key challenges associated with measuring software quality in organizations using the hybrid development model. We developed a framework called PIER (Prevention-InspectionEvaluation-Removal) to provide a comprehensive metric definition for hybrid organizations. The framework includes quality measurements, quality enforcement, and quality decision points at different organizational levels and project milestones during the software development life cycle (SDLC).

It first appears in form of gradual modification of optical properties of the element (change in refractive index or absorption) and eventually leads to formation of catastrophic damage. As this phenomenon can be governed by distinct underlying physical processes it is also sensitive to laser irradiation conditions, intrinsic material and environmental properties, thus it is not always deterministic and therefore hardly predictable. There exist models of optical fatigue that relate absorbed pulse energy, dynamics of lattice deformation, reduced mechanical strength and heat accumulation to predict optical damage, however many quantitative features of such materials as well as scaling laws of irradiation for such models remain unknown. In order to address this issue appropriate set of experimental data is needed. Thus, well known transparent material - fused quartz - was investigated in bulk by using in situ quantitative tool, namely time-resolved digital holographic microscopy. Optical materials response was investigated by optically probing excited material at different time delays.

411,411,Fuzzing Error Handling Code in Device Drivers Based on Software Fault Injection,"Device drivers remain a main source of runtime failures in operating systems. To detect bugs in device drivers, fuzzing has been commonly used in practice. However, a main limitation of existing fuzzing approaches is that they cannot effectively test error handling code. Indeed, these fuzzing approaches require effective inputs to cover target code, but much error handling code in drivers is triggered by occasional errors (such as insufficient memory and hardware malfunctions) that are not related to inputs. In this paper, based on software fault injection, we propose a new fuzzing approach named FIZZER, to test error handling code in device drivers. At compile time, FIZZER uses static analysis to recommend possible error sites that can trigger error handling code. During driver execution, by analyzing runtime information, it automatically fuzzes error-site sequences for fault injection to improve code coverage. We evaluate FIZZER on 18 device drivers in Linux 4.19, and in total find 22 real bugs. The code coverage is increased by over 15% compared to normal execution without fuzzing.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,['1712'],18.88888888888889,0.16131313131313132,0.5364141414141415,1
412,412,Understanding and Improving Regression Test Selection in Continuous Integration,"Developers rely on regression testing in their continuous integration (CI) environment to find changes that introduce regression faults. While regression testing is widely practiced, it can be costly. Regression test selection (RTS) reduces the cost of regression testing by not running the tests that are unaffected by the changes. Industry has adopted module-level RTS for their CI environment, while researchers have proposed class-level RTS. In this paper, we compare module-and class-level RTS techniques in a cloud-based CI environment, Travis. We also develop and evaluate a hybrid RTS technique that combines aspects of the module-and class-level RTS techniques. We evaluate all the techniques on real Travis builds. We find that the RTS techniques do save testing time compared to running all tests (RetestAll), but the percentage of time for a full build using RTS (76.0%) is not as low as found in previous work, due to the extra overhead in a cloud-based CI environment. Moreover, we inspect test failures from RetestAll builds, and although we find that RTS techniques can miss to select failed tests, these test failures are almost all flaky test failures. As such, RTS techniques provide additional value in helping developers avoid wasting time debugging failures not related to the recent code changes. Overall, our results show that RTS can be beneficial for the developers in the CI environment, and RTS not only saves time but also avoids misleading developers by flaky test failures.",60000745,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Urbana,United States,['1712'],21.454545454545453,-0.02797619047619048,0.3386904761904762,1
413,413,Monte Carlo analysis of ISO and raster scan laser damage protocols," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.The typical measurement error reported for laser damage tests is the fluence uncertainty due to inaccuracies in measuring the laser beam energy and its diameter. However, the inherent uncertainty of the testing protocol should also be included in the reported laser damage threshold error bars. Underestimating measurement errors can lead to false conclusions about the impact of process changes on laser damage resistance. In this study, four different laser damage precursor fluence distributions were created from randomly generated numbers and then evaluated using the ISO and raster scan laser damage test protocols to determine a laser damage threshold. Measurement errors are determined for flat top test beams for multiple cases. To add real world relevance, the impact of Gaussian test beams with beam pointing instability was modeled for the lowest accuracy laser damage precursor distribution. The impact of damage test area compared to optic dimension is also examined. The measurement error for the raster scan test ranged from 8% to 24% depending on the test beam spatial profile (flat top or Gaussian) and beam pointing stability. ISO measurement errors ranged from 4% to 250% for a simulated 10 J/cm2 test and was much more sensitive to the laser damage precursor distribution as well as the spatial profile and pointing of the test beam.

418,418,On the von Neumann entropy of graphs," Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.The von Neumann entropy of a graph is a spectral complexity measure that has recently found applications in complex networks analysis and pattern recognition. Two variants of the von Neumann entropy exist based on the graph Laplacian and normalized graph Laplacian, respectively. Due to its computational complexity, previous works have proposed to approximate the von Neumann entropy, effectively reducing it to the computation of simple node degree statistics. Unfortunately, a number of issues surrounding the von Neumann entropy remain unsolved to date, including the interpretation of this spectral measure in terms of structural patterns, understanding the relation between its two variants and evaluating the quality of the corresponding approximations. In this article, we aim to answer these questions by first analysing and comparing the quadratic approximations of the two variants and then performing an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs. We find that (1) the two entropies lead to the emergence of similar structures, but with some significant differences; (2) the correlation between them ranges from weakly positive to strongly negative, depending on the topology of the underlying graph; (3) the quadratic approximations fail to capture the presence of non-trivial structural patterns that seem to influence the value of the exact entropies; and (4) the quality of the approximations, as well as which variant of the von Neumann entropy is better approximated, depends on the topology of the underlying graph.",60105683,Southern University of Science and Technology,Shenzhen,China,['1705'],34.57142857142857,-0.00525846702317291,0.4638782785841609,0

The coatings consist of HfO2 and SiO2 layers deposited with e-beam evaporation, and laser-induced damage thresholds as high as 12.5 J/cm2 were measured at 532 nm with 3.5 ns pulses (22.5 degrees angle of incidence, in S-polarization). However, laser damage measurements at the single wavelength of 532 nm do not adequately characterize the laser damage resistance of these coatings, since they were designed to operate at dual wavelengths simultaneously. This became apparent after one of the coatings damaged prematurely at a lower fluence in the beam train, which inspired further investigations.

424,424,The Impact of Data Preparation on the Fairness of Software Systems,"Machine learning models are widely adopted in scenarios that directly affect people. The development of software systems based on these models raises societal and legal concerns, as their decisions may lead to the unfair treatment of individuals based on attributes like race or gender. Data preparation is key in any machine learning pipeline, but its effect on fairness is yet to be studied in detail. In this paper, we evaluate how the fairness and effectiveness of the learned models are affected by the removal of the sensitive attribute, the encoding of the categorical attributes, and instance selection methods (including cross-validators and random undersampling). We used the Adult Income and the German Credit Data datasets, which are widely studied and known to have fairness concerns. We applied each data preparation technique individually to analyse the difference in predictive performance and fairness, using statistical parity difference, disparate impact, and the normalised prejudice index. The results show that fairness is affected by transformations made to the training data, particularly in imbalanced datasets. Removing the sensitive attribute is insufficient to eliminate all the unfairness in the predictions, as expected, but it is key to achieve fairer models. Additionally, the standard random undersampling with respect to the true labels is sometimes more prejudicial than performing no random undersampling.",60106440,"University of Coimbra, Centre for Informatics and System",Coimbra,Portugal,['1712'],23.666666666666668,0.0033333333333333383,0.5141666666666668,1

ALADIN features a high-power UV laser source emitting nanosecond pulses at a wavelength of 355 nm. A crucial step in the development of ALADIN was the mitigation of laser-induced contamination (LIC). In this work we assess the opportunity of removing LIC deposits using UV/ozone cleaning with a mercury lamp. We find that UV/ozone cleaning is a very effective tool for removing laser-induced molecular contamination induced by the volatile components of a material mix representative of the ALADIN laser. Furthermore, we show that optical surfaces on which a contamination is removed via UV/ozone cleaning behave similar to pristine optical surfaces with respect to their susceptibility to subsequent LIC as well as laser-induced damage. These results demonstrate that UV/ozone cleaning is a useful and safe way of cleaning optical surfaces after ground-based thermal vacuum/lifetime testing.",60031159,ESTEC - European Space Research and Technology Centre,Noordwijk aan Zee,Netherlands,['1706'],23.857142857142858,0.233,0.41999999999999993,0

434,434,Generic and Robust Localization of Multi-dimensional Root Causes,"Operators of online software services periodically collect various measures with many attributes. When a measure becomes abnormal, indicating service problems such as reliability degrade, operators would like to rapidly and accurately localize the root cause attribute combinations within a huge multi-dimensional search space. Unfortunately, previous approaches are not generic or robust in that they all suffer from impractical root cause assumptions, handling only directly collected measures but not derived ones, handling only anomalies with signicant magnitudes but not those insignicant but important ones, requiring manual parameter ne-tuning, or being too slow. This paper proposes a generic and robust multi-dimensional root cause localization approach, Squeeze, that overcomes all above limitations, the first in the literature. Through our novel bottom-up then top-down searching strategy and the techniques based on our proposed generalized ripple effect and generalized potential score, Squeeze is able to reach a good trade off between search speed and accuracy in a generic and robust manner. Case studies in several banks and an Internet company show that Squeeze can localize root causes much more rapidly and accurately than the traditional manual analysis. Furthermore, our extensive experiments on semi-synthetic datasets show that the F1-score of Squeeze outperforms previous approaches by 0.4 on average, while its localization time is only about 10 seconds.",60073474,National Climate Center Beijing,Beijing,China,['1712'],30.142857142857142,0.12469135802469139,0.4978395061728395,1

437,437,Toward real-world single image super-resolution: A new benchmark and a new model,"Most of the existing learning-based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods are trained and evaluated on simulated datasets, where the low-resolution (LR) images are generated by applying a simple and uniform degradation (i.e., bicubic downsampling) to their high-resolution (HR) counterparts. However, the degradations in real-world LR images are far more complicated. As a consequence, the SISR models trained on simulated data become less effective when applied to practical scenarios. In this paper, we build a real-world super-resolution (RealSR) dataset where paired LR-HR images on the same scene are captured by adjusting the focal length of a digital camera. An image registration algorithm is developed to progressively align the image pairs at different resolutions. Considering that the degradation kernels are naturally non-uniform in our dataset, we present a Laplacian pyramid based kernel prediction network (LP-KPN), which efficiently learns per-pixel kernels to recover the HR image. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SISR models trained on our RealSR dataset deliver better visual quality with sharper edges and finer textures on real-world scenes than those trained on simulated datasets. Though our RealSR dataset is built by using only two cameras (Canon 5D3 and Nikon D810), the trained model generalizes well to other camera devices such as Sony a7II and mobile phones.",60008928,Hong Kong Polytechnic University,Kowloon,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707']",25.75,0.0768452380952381,0.42857142857142855,1

441,441,Spotting Problematic Code Lines using Nonintrusive Programmers' Biofeedback,"Recent studies have shown that programmers' cognitive load during typical code development activities can be assessed using wearable and low intrusive devices that capture peripheral physiological responses driven by the autonomic nervous system. In particular, measures such as heart rate variability (HRV) and pupillography can be acquired by nonintrusive devices and provide accurate indication of programmers' cognitive load and attention level in code related tasks, which are known elements of human error that potentially lead to software faults. This paper presents an experimental study designed to evaluate the possibility of using HRV and pupillography together with eye tracking to identify and annotate specific code lines (or even finer grain lexical tokens) of the program under development (or under inspection) with information on the cognitive load of the programmer while dealing with such lines of code. The experimental data is discussed in the paper to assess different alternatives for using code annotations representing programmers' cognitive load while producing or reading code. In particular, we propose the use of biofeedback code highlighting techniques to provide online programmer's warnings for potentially problematic code lines that may need a second look at (to remove possible bugs), and biofeedback-driven software testing to optimize testing effort, focusing the tests on code areas with higher bug probability.",60106472,"Universidade de Coimbra, Instituto de Ciências Nucleares Aplicadas à Saude",Coimbra,Portugal,['1712'],42.0,0.05350877192982456,0.46710526315789475,1
442,442,Direct comparison of laser-induced damage threshold testing protocols on dielectric mirrors: Effect of nanosecond laser pulse shape at NIR and UV wavelengths," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.As a rule of thumb, laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is often reported in terms of a single number, without even mentioning the testing details. However, meaning of reported LIDT numbers could be different depending on the testing protocol used. Such differences are not always obvious to practitioners that are designing or building laser systems (users of LIDT numbers). Furthermore, the properties of laser sources used for LIDT testing could also be very different among various testing laboratories. Thus, in order to exemplify possible effects of LIDT testing details on reported values an experimental study is conducted, where direct comparison of the most popular testing protocols, namely 1-on-1, S-on-1, R-on-1, and Raster Scan, is made. Experiments were organized in such a way that all the tests for the wavelength of interest were done on the same sample (conventional high-reflectivity HR mirror) by using both injection-seeded pulses (single longitudinal mode) as well as non-seeded (multimode) pulses with comparable effective pulse duration. Two sufficiently large dielectric mirrors were tested. Experiments were conducted for fundamental- (1064 nm) and third- (355 nm) harmonic wavelengths of Nd:YAG laser.

444,444,How to Explain a Patch: An Empirical Study of Patch Explanations in Open Source Projects,"Bugs are inevitable in software development and maintenance processes. Recently a lot of research efforts have been devoted to automatic program repair, aiming to reduce the efforts of debugging. However, since it is difficult to ensure that the generated patches meet all quality requirements such as correctness, developers still need to review the patch. In addition, current techniques produce only patches without explanation, making it difficult for the developers to understand the patch. Therefore, we believe a more desirable approach should generate not only the patch but also an explanation of the patch. To generate a patch explanation, it is important to first understand how patches were explained. In this paper, we explored how developers explain their patches by manually analyzing 300 merged bug-fixing pull requests from six projects on GitHub. Our contribution is twofold. First, we build a patch explanation model, which summarizes the elements in a patch explanation, and corresponding expressive forms. Second, we conducted a quantitative analysis to understand the distributions of elements, and the correlation between elements and their expressive forms.",60014966,Peking University,Beijing,China,['1712'],17.5,0.13333333333333333,0.6877777777777777,1

446,446,Charting a Course Through Uncertain Environments: SEA Uses Past Problems to Avoid Future Failures,"A common problem for developers is applications exhibiting new bugs after deployment. Many of these bugs can be traced to unexpected network, operating system, and file system differences that cause program executions that were successful in a development environment to fail once deployed. Preventing these bugs is difficult because it is impractical to test an application in every environment. Enter Simulating Environmental Anomalies (SEA), a technique that utilizes evidence of one application's failure in a given environment to generate tests that can be applied to other applications, to see whether they suffer from analogous faults. In SEA, models of unusual properties extracted from interactions between an application, A, and its environment guide simulations of another application, B, running in the anomalous environment. This reveals faults B may experience in this environment without the expense of deployment. By accumulating these anomalies, applications can be tested against an increasing set of problematic conditions. We implemented a tool called CrashSimulator, which uses SEA, and evaluated it against Linux applications selected from coreutils and the Debian popularity contest. Our tests found a total of 63 bugs in 31 applications with effects including hangs, crashes, data loss, and remote denial of service conditions.",60021784,New York University,New York,United States,['1712'],22.0,-0.012941919191919183,0.6107954545454545,1

448,448,Inferring Performance Bug Patterns from Developer Commits,"Performance bugs, i.e., program source code that is unnecessarily inefficient, have received significant attention by the research community in recent years. A number of empirical studies have investigated how these bugs differ from 'ordinary' bugs that cause functional deviations and several approaches to aid their detection, localization, and removal have been proposed. Many of these approaches focus on certain subclasses of performance bugs, e.g., those resulting from redundant computations or unnecessary synchronization, and the evaluation of their effectiveness is usually limited to a small number of known instances of these bugs. To provide researchers working on performance bug detection and localization techniques with a larger corpus of performance bugs to evaluate against, we conduct a study of more than 700 performance bug fixing commits across 13 popular open source projects written in C and C++ and investigate the relative frequency of bug types as well as their complexity. Our results show that many of these fixes follow a small set of bug patterns, that they are contributed by experienced developers, and that the number of lines needed to fix performance bugs is highly project dependent.",60011226,Technische Universität Darmstadt,Darmstadt,Germany,['1712'],37.0,0.09180272108843537,0.4799659863945579,1

As such, significant effort has been expended in developing laser damage testing protocols and procedures to inform laser system design and operating limits. These tests typically rely on multiple laser exposures for statistical validation. For larger aperture systems testing an area equal to that of the optical components in the system is functionally impossible requiring interrogation of sub-scale witness samples with elevated fluences. In this work, we show that, under the certain circumstances, the laser exposure used to test one location on a sample will generate additional laser-induced damage precursors in regions beyond that exposed to laser light and hence degrade the damage performance observed on subsequent exposures. In addition, we will outline the conditions under which this phenomenon occurs, as well as methods for mitigating or eliminating the effect.",60026175,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Livermore,United States,['1706'],28.0,0.05466269841269842,0.4788690476190476,0

453,453,MPro: Combining Static and Symbolic Analysis for Scalable Testing of Smart Contract,"Smart contracts are executable programs that enable the building of a programmable trust mechanism between multiple entities without the need of a trusted third-party. At the time of this writing, there were over 10 million smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum networks and this number continues to grow at a rapid pace. Smart contracts are often written in a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity, which is not easy to audit for subtle errors. Further, since smart contracts are immutable, errors have led to attacks resulting in losses of cryptocurrency worth 100s of millions of USD and reputational damage. Unfortunately, manual security analyses do not scale with size and number of smart contracts. Automated and scalable mechanisms are essential if smart contracts are to gain mainstream acceptance. Researchers have developed several security scanners in the past couple of years. However, many of these analyzer either do not scale well, or if they do, produce many false positives. This issue is exacerbated when bugs are triggered only after a series of interactions with the functions of the contract-under-test. A depth-n vulnerability, refers to a vulnerability that requires invoking a specific sequence of n functions to trigger. Depth-n vulnerabilities are time-consuming to detect by existing automated analyzers, because of the combinatorial explosion of sequences of functions that could be executed on smart contracts. In this paper, we present a technique to analyze depth-n vulnerabilities in an efficient and scalable way by combining symbolic execution and data dependency analysis. A significant advantage of combining symbolic with static analysis is that it scales much better than symbolic alone and does not have the problem of false positive that static analysis tools typically have. We have implemented our technique in a tool called MPro, a scalable and automated smart contract analyzer based on the existing symbolic analysis tool Mythril-Classic and the static analysis tool Slither. We analyzed 100 randomly chosen smart contracts on MPro and our evaluation shows that MPro is about n-times faster than Mythril-Classic for detecting depth-n vulnerabilities, while preserving all the detection capabilities of Mythril-Classic.",60014171,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Canada,['1712'],22.8,0.09306404379933791,0.5445441813088872,1

While relatively inexpensive, Borofloat has been found to have bulk inclusions which, under UV illumination, damage, grow, and occasional erupt though the surface of the DDS. We have shown previously that debris generated from Input Surface Bulk Eruptions (ISBE) are a significant source of damage on NIF. Inclusion-free fused silica debris shield (FSDS) have been installed in between the DDS and the final optics on some NIF beam lines to test their efficacy in mitigating damage initiation. We will show results of the damage performance of the FSDS and its role in protecting the final optics. These results will help in our economic analysis of the potential benefits of using FSDS to protect NIF final optics.",60026175,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Livermore,United States,['1706'],25.166666666666668,0.009027777777777779,0.5951388888888889,0
456,456,Stability of dielectric multilayer coatings for the Vacuum ultraviolet," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) reflective coatings play an important role in many high-tech fields including cosmic physics, space research, life science and synchrotron radiation. In this research, the emphasis are focused on the aging effect of 135.6nm high reflective coatings. The coatings were deposited by resistive heating method based on Lanthanum fluoride (LaF3) and Aluminum fluoride (AlF3). Optical property, surface morphology and roughness, and composition were characterized in different period after deposited. Due to the porous structure and the worse stability of lanthanum fluoride, the content of C and O element increased in LaF3 thin films during aging process. On one hand, the content of C and O are the hydrocarbon contamination from environment and packing boxes. On the other hand, due to the oxidation of film materials, the fluorides will turn into oxyfluoride, which will increase O content. As a result, there will be an increase of absorption and a decrease of reflectance of the 135.6nm high reflective coating. The surface roughness decreased which led to the reduction of scattering and the rise of reflectivity. There will be LaF3-AlF3 mixed layers between interfaces because of interface diffusion, which will further reduce the film performance.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1706'],20.4,-0.025357142857142856,0.5360714285714286,0
457,457,FILO: FIx-LOcus Recommendation for Problems Caused by Android Framework Upgrade,"Dealing with the evolution of operating systems is challenging for developers of mobile apps, who have to deal with frequent upgrades that often include backward incompatible changes of the underlying API framework. As a consequence of framework upgrades, apps may show misbehaviours and unexpected crashes once executed within an evolved environment. Identifying the portion of the app that must be modified to correctly execute on a newly released operating system can be challenging. Although incompatibilities are visibile at the level of the interactions between the app and its execution environment, the actual methods to be changed are often located in classes that do not directly interact with any external element. To facilitate debugging activities for problems introduced by backward incompatible upgrades of the operating system, this paper presents FILO, a technique that can recommend the method that must be changed to implement the fix from the analysis of a single failing execution. FILO can also select key symptomatic anomalous events that can help the developer understanding the reason of the failure and facilitate the implementation of the fix. Our evaluation with multiple known compatibility problems introduced by Android upgrades shows that FILO can effectively and efficiently identify the faulty methods in the apps.",60012306,University of Milano - Bicocca,Milan,Italy,['1712'],29.0,0.11525141525141525,0.512987012987013,1

461,461,Summary of Meeting," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.These proceedings contain the papers presented as oral and poster presentations at the 51st Annual Laser Damage Symposium (aka Annual Symposium on Optical Materials for High-Power Lasers, also Boulder Damage Symposium). The conference was held at OMNI Interlocken Hotel in Broomfield, Colorado on 22-25 September 2019. The symposium was divided into oral and poster sessions following the traditional four major topics: Thin Films; Surfaces, Mirrors and Contamination; Fundamental Mechanisms; Materials and Measurements. A Mini- Symposium was devoted to overview of the diffraction gratings for high-power lasers. A Tutorial on optical coatings for large-aperture laser systems was held by Jim Oliver as a pre-symposium event on Sunday evening. The conference was opened by Detlev Ristau with a symposium welcome. Christopher Wren Carr of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (USA), Vitaly Gruzdev of the University of New Mexico (USA), Carmen S. Menoni of the Colorado State University (USA), Detlev Ristau of the Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V. (Germany), and M. J. Soileau of CREOL - The College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida (USA) co-chaired the symposium. The founding organizers of the symposium are Dr. Arthur H. Guenther and Dr. Alexander J. Glass. 63 abstracts were submitted to the symposium and included into the conference program, of which 55 were presented at 10 oral and 4 poster sessions demonstrating the lowest number of presented submissions since 1991. No parallel sessions were held allowing the opportunity to discuss common research interests with all the presenters. With 121 attendees, 42 of which were authors, 12 - students, and 16 more - meeting co-chairs and programcommittee members, the meeting attendance was at the lowest level since 2004. In spite of that, the conference offered attendees a traditional outstanding opportunity to make many new acquaintances. Although held annually in the US, Laser Damage Symposium continues to be a true international conference with 49% of all presentations and 31.4% of the attendees coming from Europe and Asia this year. Following active discussions from previous years, the Symposium was held for the first time outside its mother city (Boulder, Colorado) - at OMNI Interlocken Hotel in Broomfield, Colorado. The 52nd Annual Symposium of this series will be held in Hilton Garden Inn Rochester / University and Medical Center in Rochester, New York, 13-16 September 2020. In response to feedback of conference participants, the 52nd meeting will be held in another US city. A traditional continuous effort will be made to ensure a close liaison between the high-energy, high-peak-power, and high-average-power laser communities. Topic of a mini-symposium of the 2020 meeting is still under consideration and will be announced in 2020 Call for Papers of Lase r Damage Symposium in later January 2020. The principal topics to be considered in 2020 do not appreciably deviate from those enumerated above. We expect to hear more about the impacts of surface contamination, debris, and surface treatment on the laser resistance of laser optics. Growing attention is paid to surface nano-structuring for production of inti-reflection effect without use of optical coatings. Influence of various defects of optical materials on laser damage continues to generate a significant interest over decades. Nonlinear and laser crystals, surfaces, and optical coatings continue to place major limitations on laser systems and remain the most active areas of laser-damage research and spirited debate. Recent progress in improvement and revision of the international standards on laser-induced damage will continue to attract significant attention of conference participants. Refinement of the mitigation strategy consisting of damage initiation followed by arresting damage growth through post-processing techniques while not creating downstream damage is also expected to be a continued focus. Laser damage by short-wavelength radiation stays an area of interest stimulated by the demand for laser-resistant UV optics utilized in laser-lithography applications. Short pulse (nanosecond and picosecond) laser optics and damage phenomena surprisingly remain an active area of research over several decades. Constant progress in the fields of ultrashort-pulse (femtosecond) lasers and ultrafast laser-material interactions continues to substantially contribute to the conference. We also expect to hear more about new measurement techniques to improve our understanding of the fundamental damage mechanisms and to advance the manufacturing of optical materials and thin films for optical components. Thin films for a broad range of laser wavelengths and pulse durations continue to stay another hot topic of the meeting. Also, recent developments in the fields of surface nano-structured and meta-optical materials, and related laser-damage issues attract growing attention due to their intensive development and potential use in high-power lasers. Fundamental aspects of laser-induced damage including laser-induced ionization, scaling of damage threshold with laser and material parameters, dynamics of the damage processes, transient material responses, generation of free-carrier plasma, and various nonlinear effects continuously attract a lot of attention due to exploration of novel ranges of laser parameters. As was initially established in 1992, several distinguished invited speakers will deliver keynote presentations of a tutorial and review nature in 2020. Invited contributors will cover recent breaking developments in the 4 key areas of the research on laser-induced damage and optical materials for lasers. Continuing the recent conference traditions, a tutorial on preparation and materials of of substrates for coating deposition will be held by Walter Siehlein, Blue Ridge (USA) as a pre-symposium event on Sunday evening. The purpose of this series of symposia is to provide an international platform for information exchange about optical materials for high-power / high-energy lasers, fundamental mechanisms of laser-induced damage and relevant laser interactions with optical materials, improvement of optical coatings, studies of contamination effects, laser-damage standards, and a broad range of topics related to laser-induced damage in various optical materials.

462,462,TamperNN: Efficient Tampering Detection of Deployed Neural Nets,"Neural networks are powering the deployment of embedded devices and Internet of Things. Applications range from personal assistants to critical ones such as self-driving cars. It has been shown recently that models obtained from neural nets can be trojaned; an attacker can then trigger an arbitrary model behavior facing crafted inputs. This has a critical impact on the security and reliability of those deployed devices. We introduce novel algorithms to detect the tampering with deployed models, classifiers in particular. In the remote interaction setup we consider, the proposed strategy is to identify markers of the model input space that are likely to change class if the model is attacked, allowing a user to detect a possible tampering. This setup makes our proposal compatible with a wide range of scenarios, such as embedded models, or models exposed through prediction APIs. We experiment those tampering detection algorithms on the canonical MNIST dataset, over three different types of neural nets, and facing five different attacks (trojaning, quantization, fine-tuning, compression and watermarking). We then validate over five large models (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, MobileNet, DenseNet) with a state of the art dataset (VGGFace2), and report results demonstrating the possibility of an efficient detection of model tampering.",60013373,INRIA Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique,Le Chesnay,France,['1712'],22.333333333333332,0.005396825396825395,0.5541269841269841,1

464,464,Evaluation of Anomaly Detection Algorithms Made Easy with RELOAD,"Anomaly detection aims at identifying patterns in data that do not conform to the expected behavior. Despite anomaly detection has been arising as one of the most powerful techniques to suspect attacks or failures, dedicated support for the experimental evaluation is actually scarce. In fact, existing frameworks are mostly intended for the broad purposes of data mining and machine learning. Intuitive tools tailored for evaluating anomaly detection algorithms for failure and attack detection with an intuitive support to sliding windows are currently missing. This paper presents RELOAD, a flexible and intuitive tool for the Rapid EvaLuation Of Anomaly Detection algorithms. RELOAD is able to automatically i) fetch data from an existing data set, ii) identify the most informative features of the data set, iii) run anomaly detection algorithms, including those based on sliding windows, iv) apply multiple strategies to features and decide on anomalies, and v) provide conclusive results following an extensive set of metrics, along with plots of algorithms scores.

466,466,A shadowing technique to arrest laser-induced damage growth on exit surface silica," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.An effective damage mitigation strategy is necessary to operate laser systems at energy densities above the damage growth threshold of their optical components. On the National Ignition Facility, growth of laser-induced damage has conventionally been arrested in situ by employing spatially registered cm-scale ""spot blockers"" in the laser beam to shadow mm-scale damage sites. Spot blockers come at a cost, however, as they obscure a portion of the laser light delivered to the target and thus require an increase in beam energy to compensate for this loss. This increase adds incremental stress to all optics in the beamline. Most spot blockers assigned to an optic are eliminated as part of the repair process when the optic is removed from NIF. However, defects too wide or deep to repair travel with the optic, along with the need for the blocker, throughout its life. Due to obscuration budgetary constraints, these permanent blockers reduce the optic's usable lifetime. In this work, we propose an alternative method for mitigating a growing damage site by placing a scattering structure of comparable size to the site upstream to shadow the site. This solution obscures much less of the laser light and increases the lifetime of the optic compared to current mitigation strategies.",60026175,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Livermore,United States,['1706'],24.0,0.10503663003663004,0.4691391941391942,0
467,467,HiRec: API Recommendation using Hierarchical Context,"Context-aware API recommendation techniques aim to generate a ranked list of candidate APIs on an editing position during development. The basic context used in traditional API recommendation mainly focuses on the APIs from third-party libraries, limit or even ignore the usage of project-specific code. The limited usage of project-specific code may result in the lack of context information, and degrade the effectiveness of API recommendation. To address this problem, we introduce a novel type of context, i.e., hierarchical context, which can leverage the hidden information of project-specific code by analyzing the call graph. In hierarchical context, a project-specific API is presented as a sequence of low-leveled APIs from third-party libraries. We propose an approach, i.e., HiRec, which builds on the basis of hierarchical context. HiRec is evaluated on 108 projects and the results show that HiRec can obtain much more accurate results than all the other selected approaches in terms of top-5 and top-10 accuracy due to the strong ability of context representation. And HiRec performs closely to the outstanding tools in terms of top-1 accuracy. The average time of recommending execution is less than 1 seconds in most cases, which is acceptable for interaction in an IDE. Unlike current approaches, the effectiveness of HiRec is not impacted much by editing positions. And we can obtain more accurate results from HiRec with larger sizes of training data and hierarchical context.",60021666,Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Nanjing,China,['1712'],20.90909090909091,0.14711779448621556,0.44085213032581455,1

471,471,Estimating Return on Investment for GUI Test Automation Frameworks,"Automated graphical user interface (GUI) tests can reduce manual testing activities and increase test frequency. This motivates the conversion of manual test cases into automated GUI tests. However, it is not clear whether such automation is cost-effective given that GUI automation scripts add to the code base and demand maintenance as a system evolves. In this paper, we introduce a method for estimating maintenance cost and Return on Investment (ROI) for Automated GUI Testing (AGT). The method utilizes the existing source code change history and has the potential to be used for the evaluation of other testing or quality assurance automation technologies. We evaluate the method for a real-world, industrial software system and compare two fundamentally different AGT frameworks, namely Selenium and EyeAutomate, to estimate and compare their ROI. We also report on their defect-finding capabilities and usability. The quantitative data is complemented by interviews with employees at the company the study has been conducted at. The method was successfully applied, and estimated maintenance cost and ROI for both frameworks are reported. Overall, the study supports earlier results showing that implementation time is the leading cost for introducing AGT. The findings further suggest that, while EyeAutomate tests are significantly faster to implement, Selenium tests require more of a programming background but less maintenance.",60016437,Göteborgs Universitet,Gothenburg,Sweden,['1712'],19.363636363636363,0.03717948717948717,0.5576923076923077,1

The mission's flight software is a combination of handwritten code and AGC developed by two different approaches: one based on state chart models (AGC-M) and another on specification dictionaries (AGC-D). The empirical analysis of fault proneness is based on 380 closed bug reports created by software developers. Our main findings include: (1) MBSwE and AGC provide some benefits, but also impose challenges. (2) SWA done only at a model level is not sufficient. AGC code should also be tested and the models and AGC should always be kept in-sync. AGC must not be changed manually. (3) Fixes made to address an individual bug report were spread both across multiple modules and across multiple files. On average, for each bug report 1.4 modules, that is, 3.4 files were fixed. (4) Most bug reports led to changes in more than one type of file. The majority of changes to auto-generated source code files were made in conjunction to changes in either file with state chart models or XML files derived from dictionaries. (5) For newly developed files, AGC-M and handwritten code were of similar quality, while AGC-D files were the least fault prone.",60021143,West Virginia University,Morgantown,United States,['1712'],19.357142857142858,0.014855072463768118,0.44166666666666665,1
475,475,Integrating Safety Certification into Model-Based Testing of Safety-Critical Systems,"Testing plays an important role in assuring the safety of safety-critical systems (SCS). Testing SCSs should include tasks to test how the system operates in the presence of failures. With the increase of autonomous, sensing-based functionality in safety-critical systems, efficient and cost-effective testing that maximizes safety evidences has become increasingly challenging. A previously proposed framework for testing safety-critical systems called Model-Combinatorial based testing (MCbt) has the potential for addressing these challenges. MCbt is a framework that proposes an integration of model-based testing, fault analysis, and combinatorial testing to produce the maximum number of evidences for an efficient safety certification process but was never actually used to derive a specific testing approach. In this paper, we present a concrete application of MCbt with an application to a case study. The validation showed that MCbt is more efficient and produces more safety evidences compared to state-of-the-art testing approaches.",109346596,University of Denver,Denver,United States,['1712'],20.857142857142858,0.20757575757575755,0.49015151515151517,1

477,477,TCD: Statically Detecting Type Confusion Errors in C++ Programs,"For performance reasons, C++, albeit unsafe, is often the programming language of choice for developing software infrastructures. A serious type of security vulnerability in C++ programs is type confusion, which may lead to program crashes and control flow hijack attacks. While existing mitigation solutions almost exclusively rely on dynamic analysis techniques, which suffer from low code coverage and high overhead, static analysis has rarely been investigated. This paper presents TCD, a static type confusion detector built on top of a precise demand-driven field-, context-and flow-sensitive pointer analysis. Unlike existing pointer analyses, TCD is type-aware as it not only preserves the type information in the pointed-to objects but also handles complex language features of C++ such as multiple inheritance and placement new, making it therefore possible to reason about type casting in C++ programs. We have implemented TCD in LLVM and evaluated it using seven C++ applications (totaling 526,385 lines of C++ code) from Qt, a widely-adopted C++ toolkit for creating GUIs and cross-platform software. TCD has found five type confusion bugs, including one reported previously in prior work and four new ones, in under 7.3 hours, with a low false positive rate of 28.2%.",60028333,University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia,Sydney,Australia,['1712'],27.714285714285715,0.09133333333333334,0.5463939393939394,1

481,481,A Tale of Two Injectors: End-to-End Comparison of IR-Level and Assembly-Level Fault Injection,"Fault injection (FI) is a commonly used experimental technique to evaluate the resilience of software techniques for tolerating hardware faults. Software-implemented FI can be performed at different levels of abstraction in the system stack; FI performed at the compiler's intermediate representation (IR) level has the advantage that it is closer to the program being evaluated and is hence easier to derive insights from for the design of software fault-tolerance mechanisms. Unfortunately, it is not clear how accurate IR-level FI is vis-a-vis FI performed at the assembly code level, and prior work has presented contradictory findings. In this paper, we perform an analysis of said prior work, find an inconsistency in the FI methodology used in one study, and show that it results in a flawed comparison between IR-level and assembly-level FI. We further confirm this finding by performing a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of IR-level FI across a range of benchmark programs and compiler optimization levels. Our results show that IR-level FI is as accurate as assembly-level FI for silent data corruptions (SDCs) across different benchmarks and optimization levels.",60010365,The University of British Columbia,Vancouver,Canada,['1712'],30.0,0.00416666666666668,0.4041666666666666,1

Fostering trust calls for assessment techniques that provide indicators about the quality of a web application from a security perspective. This paper studies the problem of using coding practices to characterize the trustworthiness of web applications from a security perspective. The hypothesis is that applying feasible security practices results in applications having a reduced number of unknown vulnerabilities, and can therefore be considered more trustworthy. The proposed approach is instantiated for the concrete case of input validation practices, and includes a Quality Model to compute trustworthiness scores that can be used to compare different applications or different code elements in the same application. Experimental results show that the higher scores are obtained for more secure code, suggesting that it can be used in practice to characterize trustworthiness, also providing guidance to compare and/or improve the security of web applications.",60025063,KU Leuven,3000 Leuven,Belgium,['1712'],27.666666666666668,0.1636363636363636,0.5022727272727273,1

485,485,Supervised Representation Learning Approach for Cross-Project Aging-Related Bug Prediction,"Software aging, which is caused by Aging-Related Bugs (ARBs), tends to occur in long-running systems and may lead to performance degradation and increasing failure rate during software execution. ARB prediction can help developers discover and remove ARBs, thus alleviating the impact of software aging. However, ARB-prone files occupy a small percentage of all the analyzed files. It is usually difficult to gather sufficient ARB data within a project. To overcome the limited availability of training data, several researchers have recently developed cross-project models for ARB prediction. A key point for cross-project models is to learn a good representation for instances in different projects. Nevertheless, most of the previous approaches neither consider the reconstruction property of new representation nor encode source samples' label information in learning representation. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Supervised Representation Learning Approach (SRLA), which is based on double encoding-layer autoencoder, to perform cross-project ARB prediction. Moreover, we present a transfer cross-validation framework to select the hyper-parameters of cross-project models.

Although some traditional safety engineering techniques such as FTA and FMEA are applicable to ML components, the unique characteristics of ML create challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel safety analysis method called Classification Failure Mode Effects Analysis (CFMEA) which is specialized to assess classification-based perception in AD. Specifically, it defines a systematic way to assess the risk due to classification failure under adversarial attacks or varying degrees of classification uncertainty across the perception-control linkage. We first present the theoretical and methodological foundations for CFMEA, and then demonstrate it by applying it to an AD case study using semantic segmentation perception trained with the Cityscapes driving dataset.

The PI alignment layer is pinned on the ITO film to imitate the structure of the LCD as much as possible in our study. Under the irradiation of the high-peak-power laser, the damage process of the PI/ITO/SUB sample involves thermally induced plastic deformation, followed by cooling when the irradiation fluence is near the LIDT, and rupture when the irradiation fluence is higher. High-average-power laser irradiation results in damaged morphologies of the bulge for the PI/ITO/SUB sample. The temperature distributions induced by the pulsed laser and the high-repetition-rate laser are investigated. The damage is attributed to the intrinsic heat absorption of the ITO films. Under the irritation of the high-peak-power laser, the temperature rises rapidly to a high degree at very short time because of the instant strong absorption in ITO layer, and resulted in vaporization of ITO layer consequently. Subsequently, the vaporized ITO breaks through the surface PI and develops the visible damage. However, under the irritation of high-average-power laser, ITO layer absorbs laser energy, resulting in a slow temperature rise and a small temperature gradient.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1706'],24.22222222222222,0.03575757575757576,0.4890909090909092,0

490,490,FluxRank: A Widely-Deployable Framework to Automatically Localizing Root Cause Machines for Software Service Failure Mitigation,"The failures of software service directly affect user experiences and service revenue. Thus operators monitor both service-level KPIs (e.g., response time) and machine-level KPIs (e.g., CPU usage) on each machine underlying the service. When a service fails, the operators must localize the root cause machines, and mitigate the failure as quickly as possible. Existing approaches have limited application due to the difficulty to obtain the required additional measurement data. As a result, failure localization is largely manual and very time-consuming. This paper presents FluxRank, a widely-deployable framework that can automatically and accurately localize the root cause machines, so that some actions can be triggered to mitigate the service failure. Our evaluation using historical cases from five real services (with tens of thousands of machines) of a top search company shows that the root cause machines are ranked top 1 (top 3) for 55 (66) cases out of 70 cases. Comparing to existing approaches, FluxRank cuts the localization time by more than 80% on average.

493,493,Test Case Generation Based on Client-Server of Web Applications by Memetic Algorithm,"Currently, more than 90% web applications are potentially vulnerable to attacks from both the client side and server side. Test case generation plays a crucial role in testing web applications, where most existing studies focus on test case generation either from client-side or from server-side to detect vulnerabilities, regardless of the interactions between client and server. Consequently, it is difficult for those test cases to discover certain faults which involve both client and server. In this paper, the server-side sensitive paths are considered as vulnerable code paths due to insufficient or erroneous filtering mechanisms. An evolutionary testing approach based on the memetic algorithm is proposed to connect the server-side and client-side, in which test cases are generated from the client-side behavior model, while guided by the coverage of sensitive paths from server-side. The experiments are conducted on four open source web applications, and the results demonstrate that our approach can generate test cases from the client-side behavior model that can cover the server-side sensitive paths, on which the vulnerabilities can be detected more effectively.",60021843,Beijing University of Chemical Technology,Beijing,China,['1712'],29.0,0.03261904761904762,0.6697619047619049,1

495,495,Identifying Crashing Fault Residence Based on Cross Project Model,"Analyzing the crash reports recorded upon software crashes is a critical activity for software quality assurance. Predicting whether or not the fault causing the crash (crashing fault for short) resides in the stack traces of crash reports can speed-up the program debugging process and determine the priority of the debugging efforts. Previous work mostly collected label information from bug-fixing logs, and extracted crash features from stack traces and source code to train classification models for the Identification of Crashing Fault Residence (ICFR) of newly-submitted crashes. However, labeled data are not always fully available in real applications. Hence the classifier training is not always feasible. In this work, we make the first attempt to develop a cross project ICFR model to address the data scarcity problem. This is achieved by transferring the knowledge from external projects to the current project via utilizing a state-of-the-art Balanced Distribution Adaptation (BDA) based transfer learning method.

497,497,OpenErrorPro: A New Tool for Stochastic Model-Based Reliability and Resilience Analysis,"Increasing complexity and heterogeneity of modern safety-critical systems require advanced tools for quantitative reliability analysis. Most of the available analytical software exploits classical methods such as event trees, static and dynamic fault trees, reliability block diagrams, simple Bayesian networks, and Markov chains. First, these methods fail to adequately model complex interaction of software, hardware, physical components, dynamic feedback loops, propagation of data errors, nontrivial failure scenarios, sophisticated fault tolerance, and resilience mechanisms. Second, these methods are limited to the evaluation of the fixed set of traditional reliability metrics such as the probability of generic system failure, failure rate, MTTF, MTBF, and MTTR. More flexible models, such as the Dual-graph Error Propagation Model (DEPM) can overcome these limitations but have no available tools. This paper introduces the first open-source DEPM-based analytical software tool OpenErrorPro. The DEPM is a formal stochastic model that captures control and data flow structures and reliability-related properties of executable system components. The numerical analysis in OpenErrorPro is based on the automatic generation of Markov chain models and the utilization of modern Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC) techniques. The PMC enables the analysis of highly-customizable resilience metrics, e.g. 'the probability of system recovery after a specified system failure during the defined time interval', in addition to the traditional reliability metrics. DEPMs can be automatically generated from Simulink/Stateflow, UML/SysML, and AADL models, as well as source code of software components using LLVM. This allows not only the automated model-based evaluation but also the analysis of systems developed using the combination of several modeling paradigms. The key purpose of the tool is to close the gap between the conventional system design models and advanced analytical methods in order to give system reliability engineers easy and automated access to the full potential of PMC techniques. Finally, OpenErrorPro enables the application of several effective optimizations against the state space explosion of underlying Markov models already in the DEPM level where the system semantics such as control and data flow structures are accessible.",60018353,Technische Universität Dresden,Dresden,Germany,['1712'],23.5,0.08501552795031057,0.4411231884057973,1

This has motivated a substantial effort in the last decades to better understand laser induced damage mechanisms and their mitigation. One major damage mechanism limitation to laser systems at high peak intensities is filamentation in fused silica glass, due to Kerr self-focusing of the light [1], that has been motivating an on-going effort for the last few decades [2]. The past studies had led to a set of simplified rules that allows for the operation of laser system below the onset point for this mechanism to take place, namely what is known as the IL rule (intensity times the collapse distance before filamenting equals some empirical constant) and the Bespalov-Talanov (BT) perturbation growth theory [3-6]. The need to increase the laser beam intensities and optimize the throughput, closer to the point where the optical propagation length in the material is comparable to the predicted filamentation distance, requires revisiting and improving our understanding of the current rule set. This is especially emphasized by the shortcomings of these two highly useful yet under-justified models for the relevant situations of large aperture beams where the contrast perturbations on the beam are the seed for the filamentations (i.e., and not whole beam collapse).",60026175,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,Livermore,United States,['1706'],38.833333333333336,0.09240746753246752,0.39573917748917753,0

The spread of logging technologies promotes approaches where such models are learned from observed events. We consider a system visiting transient states of a hidden process until reaching a final state and producing observations with stochastic arrival times and types conditioned by visited states, and we abstract it as a marked Markov modulated Poisson Process (MMMPP) with left-to right structure. We present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that learns the MMMPP parameters from observation sequences acquired in repeated execution of the transient behavior, and we use the model at runtime to infer the current state of the process from actual observed events and to dynamically evaluate the remaining time to the final state. The approach is illustrated using synthetic datasets generated from a stochastic attack tree of the literature enriched with an observation model associating each state with an expected statistics of observation types and arrival times. Accuracy of prediction is evaluated under different variability of hidden states sojourn durations and of the observations arrival process, and compared against previous literature that mainly exploits either the timing or the types of observed events.",60021859,Università degli Studi di Firenze,Florence,Italy,['1712'],32.66666666666667,-0.0031746031746031746,0.45349206349206345,1

Both samples exhibit a raised, ""blister"" morphology for a range of fluences between the damage and ablation thresholds. The fluence range associated with blister formation is much larger for FCPs than for 110 fs pulses, and TRSM images at early time-delays show that the density of the laser-generated plasma is much higher for 110 fs pulses for a lower fluence relative to the damage threshold. Also, for high enough fluences the excited electron density exhibits a fast decay down to a significantly high value, which remains even after the onset of mechanical damage of the layers. The pulse duration dependence suggests that as fluence is increased, the increase in absorbed energy is more gradual for FCPs, which points towards inherent differences in the way high intensity FCPs are absorbed in dielectrics relative to longer femtosecond laser pulses.",60003500,The Ohio State University,Columbus,United States,['1706'],36.4,0.09441520467836258,0.46304093567251464,0
510,510,Laser-induced damage threshold by high pulse repetition rate ArF excimer laser radiation," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.In the semiconductor industry, optical projection lithography is employed for the production of microchips. In this process ultraviolet radiation has been used to exposure of photoresists on silicon wafers. Light sources with shorter wavelength are needed to shrink the chip size due to the diffraction limit. Pulsed excimer lasers have been used since the middle of 1990s instead of mercury lamps. At first KrF lasers (248-nm) were adopted, then ArF lasers (193-nm) have been applied to satisfy tighter leading edge device requirements. Now almost 5,000 excimer lasers for lithography tools are being operated at the world-wide semiconductor fab with stable, its availability up to 99.8%. The latest ArF excimer laser can pulse 15mJ to 20mJ energy with 6-kHz repetition rate, its typical module lifetime which can be replaced is several dozen Billion pulses. The module lifetime are expected to expand to reduce the downtime to replace. Also for precise micromachining applications, ArF hybrid laser consists of all-solid-state DUV light source as a seed laser and excimer laser as amplifier is been developed. The pulse width of this laser is typically sub-nanosecond and its high peak power is another concern for laser optics. Generally, the lifespan of optical elements has been growing to reach 100 Bpls, and its evaluation takes a very long time, typically several years. Comprehensive durability evaluation becomes more efficient by creating accelerated element tests [1]. As an alternative, accelerated lifetime testing with high fluence are helpful approach to screen and select the optics to satisfy the lifetime requirement. We have been developing the accelerated test system to determinate the laser-induced damage threshold of optical surfaces. In this paper, the test system and some results of field-approved optics with 20ns pulse duration will be explained.",60103395,Gigaphoton Inc,Oyamashi,Japan,['1706'],19.8,0.12087719298245615,0.4425438596491228,0
511,511,Criteria to Systematically Evaluate (Safety) Assurance Cases,"An assurance case (AC) captures explicit reasoning associated with assuring critical properties, such as safety. A vital attribute of an AC is that it facilitates the identification of fallacies in the validity of any claim. There is considerable published research related to confidence in ACs, which primarily relate to a measure of soundness of reasoning. Evaluation of an AC is more general than measuring confidence and considers multiple aspects of the quality of an AC. Evaluation criteria thus play a significant role in making the evaluation process more systematic. This paper contributes to the identification of effective evaluation criteria for ACs, the rationale for their use, and initial tests of the criteria on existing ACs. We classify these criteria as to whether they apply to the structure of the AC, or to the content of the AC. This paper focuses on safety as the critical property to be assured, but only a very small number of the criteria are specific to safety, and can serve as placeholders for evaluation criteria specific to other critical properties. All of the other evaluation criteria are generic. This separation is useful when evaluating ACs developed using different notations, and when evaluating ACs against safety standards. We explore the rationale for these criteria as well as the way they are used by the developers of the AC and also when they are used by a third-party evaluator.",60106385,"McMaster University, Faculty of Engineering",Hamilton,Canada,['1712'],21.09090909090909,0.098,0.44980000000000003,1

517,517,How Do Developers Act on Static Analysis Alerts? An Empirical Study of Coverity Usage,"Static analysis tools (SATs) often fall short of developer satisfaction despite their many benefits. An understanding of how developers in the real-world act on the alerts detected by SATs can help improve the utility of these tools and determine future research directions. The goal of this paper is to aid researchers and tool makers in improving the utility of static analysis tools through an empirical study of developer action on the alerts detected by Coverity, a state-of-the-art static analysis tool. In this paper, we analyze five open source projects as case studies (Linux, Firefox, Samba, Kodi, and Ovirt-engine) that have been actively using Coverity over a period of at least five years. We investigate the alert occurrences and developer triage of the alerts from the Coverity database; identify the alerts that were fixed through code changes (i.e. actionable) by mining the commit history of the projects; analyze the time an alert remain in the code base (i.e. lifespan) and the complexity of code changes (i.e. fix complexity) in fixing the alert. We find that 27.4% to 49.5% (median: 36.7%) of the alerts are actionable across projects, a rate higher than previously reported. We also find that the fixes of Coverity alerts are generally low in complexity (2 to 7 lines of code changes in the affected file, median: 4). However, developers still take from 36 to 245 days (median: 96) to fix these alerts. Finally, our data suggest that severity and fix complexity may correlate with an alert's lifespan in some of the projects.",60098463,Microsoft Research Cambridge,Cambridge,United Kingdom,['1712'],21.166666666666668,0.06764705882352942,0.49950980392156863,1

520,520,Textout: Detecting Text-Layout Bugs in Mobile Apps via Visualization-Oriented Learning,"Layout bugs commonly exist in mobile apps. Due to the fragmentation issues of smartphones, a layout bug may occur only on particular versions of smartphones. It is quite challenging to detect such bugs for state-of-the-art commercial automated testing platforms, although they can test an app with thousands of different smartphones in parallel. The main reason is that typical layout bugs neither crash an app nor generate any error messages. In this paper, we present our work for detecting text-layout bugs, which account for a large portion of layout bugs. We model text-layout bug detection as a classification problem. This then allows us to address it with sophisticated image processing and machine learning techniques. To this end, we propose an approach which we call Textout. Textout takes screenshots as its input and adopts a specifically-tailored text detection method and a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier to perform automatic text-layout bug detection. We collect 33,102 text-region images as our training dataset and verify the effectiveness of our tool with 1,481 text-region images collected from real-world apps.

Dielectric coating technologies for those materials are well known and established; both high-reflective and anti-reflective coatings prepared on such substrates demonstrated laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) exceeding tens J·cm-2 in nanosecond regime. However, LIDT became a major issue in further exploitation of crystalline materials as yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) crystals, which often serves as a host in laser media and would be used in other components as well. One of the current challenge is the ability to transfer thin film coating technology used on glass to YAG in order to reach the same performance as in the case of fused silica or BK7 counterparts.

To verify these interactions, developers write so-called 'integration tests' that exercise the software within a specific environment. These tests are not only difficult to write as their environment is complicated, but they are also brittle because changes outside the code (i.e., in the environment) might make them fail unexpectedly. Integration tests are thus underused whereas they could help find many more issues. We hence propose CAMP, a tool that amplifies an existing integration test by exploring variations of the given environment. The tests that CAMP generates alter the services orchestration, the software stacks, the individual components' configuration or any combination thereof.

527,527,Machine Learning and Constraint Solving for Automated Form Testing,"In recent years there has been a focus on the automatic generation of test cases using white box testing techniques, however the same cannot be said for the generation of test cases at the system-level from natural language system requirements. Some of the white-box techniques include: the use of constraint solvers for the automatic generation of test inputs at the white box level; the use of control flow graphs generated from code; and the use of path generation and symbolic execution to generate test inputs and test for path feasibility. Techniques such as boundary value analysis (BVA) may also be used for generating stronger test suites. However, for black box testing we rely on specifications or implicit requirements and spend considerable time and effort designing and executing test cases. This paper presents an approach that leverages natural language processing and machine learning techniques to capture black box system behavior in the form of constraints.

529,529,Weakly Coupled Markov Decision Processes with Imperfect Information,"Weakly coupled Markov decision processes (MDPs) are stochastic dynamic programs where decisions in independent sub-MDPs are linked via constraints. Their exact solution is computationally intractable. Numerical experiments have shown that Lagrangian relaxation can be an effective approximation technique. This paper considers two classes of weakly coupled MDPs with imperfect information. In the first case, the transition probabilities for each sub-MDP are characterized by parameters whose values are unknown. This yields a Bayes-adaptive weakly coupled MDP. In the second case, the decision-maker cannot observe the actual state and instead receives a noisy signal. This yields a weakly coupled partially observable MDP. Computationally tractable approximate dynamic programming methods combining semi-stochastic certainty equivalent control or Thompson sampling with Lagrangian relaxation are proposed. These methods are applied to a class of stochastic dynamic resource allocation problems and to restless multi-armed bandit problems with partially observable states.

530,530,A Reliable Deployment Strategy for Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: A Discrete Event Simulation Model for Power Grid and Traffic Networks,"Today, with the help of low-cost and clean electricity, electric vehicles (EVs) show great potential for future urban transportation with little greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, the use of EVs is still in its infancy with limited numbers of users worldwide. Public charging infrastructures can be one of the drivers to enhance the prevalence of EVs. In this paper, we aim to develop a framework to establish a reliable urban public charging infrastructure. We first determine the optimal locations and size of those stations by a robust optimization model incorporating uncertain traffic flows and existing power grid networks; and then we use a discrete event simulation approach to model more realistic charging demands. We further improve these optimal solutions and verify the EV charging infrastructure considering both power and transportation networks.

532,532,Hybrid System Modeling Approach for the Depiction of the Energy Consumption in Production Simulations,"In many industrial manufacturing companies, energy has become a major cost factor. Energy aspects are included in the decision-making system of production planning and control to reduce manufacturing costs. For this priority, the simulation of production processes requires not only the consideration of logistical and technical production factors but also the integration of time-dependent energy flows which are continuous in nature. A hybrid simulation, using a continuous approach to depict the energy demand of production processes in combination with a discrete approach to map the material flows and logistic processes, shows the complex interactions between material flow and energy usage in production closer to reality. This paper presents a hybrid simulation approach combining System Dynamics, Discrete-Event and Agent-Based Simulation for energy efficiency analysis in production, considering the energy consumption in the context of planning and scheduling operations and applying it to a use-case scenario of mechanical processing of die-cast parts.",60030040,Technische Universität Ilmenau,Ilmenau,Germany,"['1712', '1706']",30.0,0.052500000000000005,0.5,1
533,533,From open set to closed set: Counting objects by spatial divide-and-conquer,"Visual counting, a task that predicts the number of objects from an image/video, is an open-set problem by nature, i.e., the number of population can vary in [0,+∞) in theory. However, the collected images and labeled count values are limited in reality, which means only a small closed set is observed. Existing methods typically model this task in a regression manner, while they are likely to suffer from an unseen scene with counts out of the scope of the closed set. In fact, counting is decomposable. A dense region can always be divided until the count values of sub-regions are within the previously observed closed set. Inspired by this idea, we propose a simple but effective approach, Spatial Divide-and-Conquer Network (S-DCNet). S-DCNet learns to classify closed-set counts and can generalize to open-set counts via S-DC. S-DCNet is also efficient. To avoid repeatedly computing sub-region convolutional features, S-DC is executed on the feature map instead of on the input image. S-DCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three crowd counting datasets (ShanghaiTech, UCF-CC-50 and UCF-QNRF), a vehicle counting dataset (TRANCOS) and a plant counting dataset (MTC). Compared to the previous best methods, S-DCNet brings a 20.2% relative improvement on the ShanghaiTechPart B, 20.9% on the UCF-QNRF, 22.5% on the TRANCOS and 15.1% on the MTC.

534,534,Batch-normalized Convolutional Neural Networks for Defect Detection of the Steel Strip,"Surface defect detection uses advanced machine vision inspection technology to detect defects such as spots, pits, scratches and chromatic aberrations on the surface of the workpiece. The traditional machine vision detection method requires manual selection of defect features as the basis of defect identification, which is time-consuming and laborious and has low accuracy in defect detection. To overcome the aforementioned deficiencies, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed as a deep learning model to extract the defect features autonomously in an elegant way. In this paper, two smaller convolution kernels form a parallel channel in two layers of the convolutional neural network architecture, and then the results of the operation are fused to extract multi-scale information, which increases the adaptability of the network to scale. Besides, the batch normalization (BN) is introduced into convolutional neural network to standardize the data distribution, offering an easy starting condition for training and improving the generalization characteristics of the network. A steel strip defect data sets are adopted to conform the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method accelerate the training process through reducing the training epoch number, the accuracy and detection consistency on the steel strip defect data sets achieve a superior performance to the existing methods.",60016835,Beijing Institute of Technology,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",30.0,0.16410256410256413,0.48333333333333334,1

The FDM detects f-wave frequencies and amplitudes at frame sizes of 0.15 seconds. We demonstrate our method on a dataset comprising of ECG recordings from 23 patients (61.65 ± 11.63 years, 78.26% male) before cryoablation; 2 paroxysmal AF, 16 early persistent AF (<12 months duration), and 4 longstanding persistent AF (>12 months duration). Moreover, some of these patients received adenosine to enhance their RR intervals before ablation. Our method extracts features from FDM outputs to train statistical machine learning classifiers. Tenfold cross-validation demonstrates that the Random Forest and Decision Tree models performed best for the pre-ablation without and with adenosine datasets, with accuracy 60.89 ± 0.31% and 59.58% ± 0.04%, respectively. While the results are modest, they demonstrate that f-wave features can be used for AF stratification. The accuracies are similar for the two tests, slightly better for the case without adenosine, showing that the FDM can successfully model short f-waves without the need to concatenate f-wave sequences or adenosine to elongate RR intervals.",60158039,Sciences et Technologies de la Musique et du Son,Paris,France,['1700'],23.5,0.195,0.43499999999999994,1
536,536,Solving Challenges at the Interface of Simulation and Big Data Using Machine Learning,"Modeling Simulation (MS) and Machine Learning (ML) have been used separately for decades. They can also straightforwardly be employed in the same study by contrasting the results of a theory-driven MS model with the most accurate data-driven ML model. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from seeing ML and MS as two independent activities to identifying how their integration can solve challenges that emerge in a big data context. Since several works have already examined this interaction for conceptual modeling or model building (e.g., creating components with ML and embedding them in the MS model), our analysis is devoted on three relatively under-studied stages: calibrating a simulation model using ML, dealing with the issues of large search space by employing ML for experimentation, and identifying the right visualizations of model output by applying ML to characteristics of the output or actions of the users.",60032706,Miami University,Oxford,United States,"['1712', '1706']",36.5,0.1775,0.2822619047619047,1

Inner simulations are then conducted in each scenario to estimate the corresponding portfolio losses, whose distribution entails the tail risk of interest. In this paper we propose an iterative procedure, called Importance-Allocated Nested Simulation (IANS), for tail risk estimation.

539,539,Transmural Ventricular Heterogeneities Play a Major Role in Determining T-Wave Morphology at Different Extracellular Potassium Levels,"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects more than 10% of the world population. ESRD patients present impaired potassium homeostasis, which increases the risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Noninvasive estimation of serum potassium, [K+], before the patient experiences serious consequences is of major importance. In this study, we investigated the relationship of [K+] with three T-wave morphological descriptors: the T-wave width (Tw), slope-to-amplitude ratio (TSA) and temporal morphological variability (dw) from ECGs of 12 ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis and from simulated ECGs. Spearman's correlation coefficients between the descriptors Tw, TSA and dw and [K+] were -0.5, 0. 8 and 0.65, respectively. These associations were, however, highly patient-dependent. The high inter-individual variability in T-wave morphology, particularly observed at high [K+], was reproduced in the simulations and could be explained by differences in transmural heterogeneities, with 10% variations in the proportion of midmyocardial cells leading to changes larger than 15% in T-wave morphology. In conclusion, T-wave morphological descriptors have the potential to be used as predictors of [K+] in ESRD patients, but their associated inter-individual variability should be taken into account, especially under hyperkalemic conditions.",60102125,Université de Bordeaux,Bordeaux,France,['1700'],20.444444444444443,0.05898809523809524,0.48,1

541,541,The Effect of the Distribution of the Inverse Growth Rate on Pancreatic Cancer Progression,"Pancreatic cancer is a low-incidence disease, where tumor progression studies using patient longitudinal data had limited sample sizes. Estimating the tumor inverse growth rate and its distribution are a challenge. Using a tumor progression model that incorporates the distribution of the inverse growth rate as the underlying assumption of the model, pancreatic cancer progression models were built assuming two distributions for the inverse growth rate: Uniform and Gamma. This study uses simulation to evaluate the effect of the tumor inverse growth rate distribution on the tumor progression models by examining tumor timelines. It was found that the tumor timeline is about nine months longer under the assumption that the inverse growth rate follows Gamma distribution. It was inconclusive whether tumor progression is faster or slower in older patients as the tumor progression models with the different underlying assumptions on the inverse growth rate yielded opposite results.",60070287,German Jordanian University,Amman,Jordan,"['1712', '1706']",24.333333333333332,0.023809523809523808,0.26904761904761904,1
542,542,An Automated Platform to Standardize Position in the Left Atrium and Map Electrophysiological Data,"Introduction Atrial mapping is essential to guide atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, but we still lack tools for intra-patient analysis and inter-patient comparisons. We propose a platform to map electrophysiological data in a standardized atrial coordinate space. Methods Left (LA: 828±326 points) and right (RA: 612±254 points) atria were mapped in 36 persistent AF patients (28 male, 68±11 years, AF duration 8±10 months) before ablation. Voltage and fractionation as quantified by the shortest interval between consecutive complex fractionated EGMs (SCI) were assessed from 10-s bipolar electrograms (EGMs). A coordinate system was determined in each atrium by solving Laplace's equation with appropriate Dirichlet boundary conditions. Mean distributions of SCI and voltage over a reference anatomy were compared through the Kruskal-Wallis test in the LA lateral, anterior, posterior, and septal walls, and the upper, lower and septal RA regions. Results Voltage was lower on the LA septum and the lower RA (p<0.0001). Higher fragmentation was measured by lower SCI on the LA septum and the upper RA (p<0.0001).

The manual auscultation method is retained as the current ""gold standard"". This study was designed to evaluate the variability of repeat measurements by the same operator, and between operators, when evaluating the same data.Ten young volunteer subjects with no known cardiovascular disease were studied. Korotkoff sounds were recorded from a standard stethoscope head connected to an acoustic microphone, and the audio sounds recorded during blood pressure measurements with cuff deflation, while subjects sat quietly on a chair. All recordings were replayed blindly and independently, to two trained operators. The operators identified systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) without knowledge of the subject. After all recordings had been analysed once, the analysis was repeated.SBP rangedfrom 95 to 112 mmHg, and DBP from 58 to 78 mmHg. The difference in repeat listening measurements for each observer was -0.8 ±3.3 and -0.5 ±2.1 mmHg for SBP, and -0.4 ±2.3 and 0.4 ± 1.7 mmHg for DBP. The difference between the two operators for each measurement was 0.7 ± 1.6 and 0.9 ± 3.6 mmHg for SBP, and -1.7 ± 2.3 and -1.0 ± 2.0 mmHg for DBP.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is an important indicator for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Accurate analysis of ECG plays a key role in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Underdeveloped areas have always been a high-risk area for cardiovascular disease and there are few doctors for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. One solution is using a telemedicine system for disease diagnosis. However, the quality of the ECG signal collected is not necessarily reliable and may impact diagnosis. In order to solve the problem, we have studied various methods for assessing the quality of ECG signals. In the paper, we analyzed the 12-lead ECG data provided by PhysioNet and selected two features of the time domain: the number of R peaks and the amplitude difference. These two features were extracted from the ECG data to form a matrix of 24 features. We trained the classification model with the feature matrix and achieved a classification accuracy of 95.80% on the test set.

We hypothesized that acute modifications of the coronary sinus (CS) pacing cathode movements induced by biventricular pacing may be related to resynchronization process and consequently may carry predictive power on CRT response. A method for the 3D reconstruction of CS lead's pacing cathode trajectory (3DTJ) throughout a cardiac cycle showed that trajectory's geometry suddenly changed in responders (R) upon starting of biventricular pacing, becoming less eccentric and more multi-directional. Our multicenter observational study aimed at evaluating the clinical value of 3DTJ. Out of 119 patients enrolled, 50 have ended follow-up and have been analyzed. Concordance between 3DTJ metrics and response was 82% overall (41/50), 91% in R (31/34), 62% in NR (10/16). The proposed 3DTJ metric showed high sensitivity (91%) with specificity=62%; PPV=84%, NPV=77%. From our data, 3DTJ seems a promising tool to acutely predict CS pacing site-specific response to CRT.

547,547,Isosbestic Point in Optical Mapping; Theoretical and Experimental Determination with Di-4-ANBDQPQ Transmembrane Voltage Sensitive Dye,"Optical mapping methods utilize fluorescence dyes to measure dynamic response of cardiac tissue such as changes in transmembrane potential (Vm). For the commonly used Vm sensitive dyes, a dye absorption and emission spectra shift as Vm changes. Signals relevant to Vm are calculated as a relative fluorescence change with respect to the fluorescence baseline. The amplitude of the change depends on the long-pass (LP) filter cut-on wavelength, placed on the sensor side, and the excitation wavelength. An excitation wavelength near the absorption peak, termed the isosbestic point, results in minimal absorption coefficient change as absorption spectra shifts. Consequentially the fluorescence intensity virtually does not change, when fluorescence across the entire emission spectra is measured, irrelevant of Vm changes. In this study we experimentally determined the isosbestic point for a near infrared dye Di-4-ANBDQPQ. We then present a theoretical study examining the dye linear or non-linear response as the fractional fluorescence change of Vm change, due to emission spectra shift and amplitude change, over a range of excitation wavelengths and LP filters.

553,553,High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Therapy Guidance System by Image-Based Registration for Patients with Cardiac Fibrillation,"Transesophageal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) energy can be used to treat cardiac arrhythmia efficiently non-invasively. Since the esophagus is located just behind the heart, it offers a perfect acoustic window. Hence, HIFU can be directed toward the heart to perform ablation. In a previous study a HIFU probe with one 2D US image perpendicular to the esophagus axis for guidance purpose has been proposed. A new dual-mode HIFU probe with two perpendicular 2D US imaging plane is now under development. In this paper we propose a therapy guidance system, based on an intensity-based registration of the two perpendicular 2D US to preoperative 3D CT. As a proof of concept we developed the following evaluation framework on a numerical phantom: 1) we define a ground truth (GT) initial pose inside a CT volume and simulated two perpendicular US images from the CT data; 2) we run the registration framework from 55 randomly defined pose initializations around the initial GT pose; and 3) we estimated the accuracy of the registration by (a) the transformation parameter estimation errors and (b) Target Registration Error (TRE). The accuracy of the registration using two 2D US plane has been compared to the previous work performed on only one US plane. An improvement was observed when using two 2D US planes with regards to the previous one US plane.",60105589,Laboratoire Traitement du Signal et de l'Image,Rennes,France,['1700'],24.666666666666668,-0.008116883116883114,0.32532467532467535,1

To discourage partial deliveries due to unacceptable, defective products, retailers can unilaterally back-charge the supplier a penalty or collaboratively improve the supplier's production process yield and reduce the supplier's quality investment expenditure. In this study, we create an analytical model that compares the retailer's penalty-enforcement and cost-reduction approaches in which the supplier must optimize its production process yield to minimize the total expected cost. The findings indicate that using either approach can induce the supplier to improve process yield. The simulation results show that the cost-reduction approach may require less effort than the penalty-enforcement approach to attain the same level of quality improvement.",60020426,Bucknell University,Lewisburg,United States,"['1712', '1706']",23.0,-0.14166666666666666,0.3880952380952381,1

While it is known that ASCVD has familial and genetic components, understanding the role of genetic testing in the prevention and treatment of the cardiovascular disease has been limited. To this end, we develop a simulation framework to estimate the risk for ASCVD events due to clinical and genetic factors. One controllable risk factor for ASCVD events is the cholesterol level of patients. Cholesterol treatment plans are modeled using Markov decision processes. By simulating the health trajectory of patients, we determine the impact of genetic testing in optimal cholesterol treatment plans.

However, the morphological and electro-physiological details remain unclear. Here, we performed preliminary computer simulations of anterograde, accessory pathway conduction using a simplified wall model. Our model features simplified atrial and ventricular walls, and a myocardial bundle (the accessory pathway). The action potentials of these components were represented by Courtemenche and O'Hara-Rudy models. We performed computer simulations to explore relationships among accessory pathway bundle size, intercellular conductivity, and anterograde conduction. We found that a thick accessory pathway facilitates anterograde conduction, ventricular conductivity promotes such conduction, and the accessory pathway prevents anterograde conduction. Source-sink mismatch may explain the first two points; an electro-tonic effect may explain the last one.

However, placing all the electrodes on the body will be inconvenient and affect the daily activities of the patient. In addition, transmitting all the lead information will require high power and large memory in remote ECG monitoring. Accounting this, we propose here a novel 2 to 12 lead reduction system for remote ECG monitoring applications. In the proposed method, the coefficient values of all the leads are generated as the first step using the least-square fit method and heart-vector projection. For the 12 lead ECG reconstruction, lead I and V2 are taken as the basis leads. As a part of the reconstruction, Lead II is derived initially from these two basis leads (Lead I, V2) using the HVP computation. After LeadII derivation, these three (I, II, V2) leads acts as basis leads and will derive remaining leads (V1, V3, V4, V5, V6) by repeating the HVP computation.

But production and engineering lots compete for the same expensive equipment. Therefore, considering them in an integrated way is desirable. In this paper, we propose two production planning formulations based on linear programming (LP) for a simplified semiconductor supply chain. The first planning model is based on reduced capacity for production due to engineering lots, while the second model directly incorporates engineering activities. Additional capacity is considered in the latter model due to learning effects that represent process improvements.

However, force amplification frames are commonly required to amplify the load applied to piezoelectric stacks. This paper proposes an energy harvester based on piezoelectric stacks without force amplification frames. The piezoelectric stacks are composed of annular piezoelectric sheets separated into several conductive sectors on the surface and mounted on a beam through a threaded sleeve and a nut. Experiments and simulations are carried out to evaluate the output performance of the energy harvester when the beam vibrates in transverse direction. The effects of excitation frequency, sector number, preload level, mounting position and piezoelectric sheet number on the output voltage are evaluated. Results from experiments and simulations show that the energy harvester gets the highest output gain as the excitation frequency reaches the resonant frequency of beam. When the piezoelectric sheets are divided into two insulated semi-circular regions, the best output performance can be obtained under the same loading conditions. Increasing the preload level is also beneficial for achieving high output voltage. However, this effect gets insignificant when the preload reaches to a certain value. The output gain of the energy harvester increases with the number of piezoelectric sheets. The output voltage is higher when the energy harvester is mounted at the beam center than that mounted at the beam ends.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,['1711'],19.0,0.21220779220779218,0.416038961038961,1

Besides, inner aortic flow is associated with its wall dynamics. Thus, our aim was to quantify aortic flow changes using 4D flow MRI in the setting of ascending aorta (AA) dilation.Methods: We studied 20 patients with TAA and tricuspid aortic valve (TAA) and 56 healthy controls (30 subjects, 36±9y ≤50 years named YC, 26 subjects, 65±9y >50 years named OC). All underwent 4D flow MRI. After aortic segmentation, regional volume of backward flow (VBF) was extracted in addition to in-cross-section velocity standard deviation (SD) as well as maximal velocity jet angle (Angle) and eccentricity (Ecc). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess ability of flow indices to characterize dilation.Results: While AA Dmax changed by 1.4 folds between TAA and OC, VBF changed by 6.5 folds, and Ecc, Angle and SD changed by 1.3 to 1.9 folds between the two groups. Moreover VBF varied consistently with age and was able to detect AA dilation with an accuracy of 0.98.Conclusion: 4D flow MRI indices of local aortic flow disorganization, specifically backward flow, were able to accurately characterize dilation.",60030857,Hopital Europeen Georges-Pompidou,Paris,France,['1700'],29.428571428571427,0.13589743589743591,0.42948717948717946,1

Since direct measurement devices are often cumbersome to wear, we hence aim to obtain an accurate estimation of BR using other monitored signals, such as PPG or ECG. However, derived modulations from these signals are highly dependent on patient and activity type, making the task difficult as to switching among the modulations. We have previously proposed respiration quality index(RQI) based selection method to update the optimal modulation in a realtime manner. A fusion strategy has also been proposed by coupling the RQI with a Kalman smoother to further exploit the sinusoidal waveforms observed from different modulations. In the current study, we further investigate the enhancement of model complexity of the Kalman smoother by introducing multiple frequency dynamics. Performances are compared to reference methods (Pimentel2016, Karlen2013) on the Capnobase Benchmark dataset. In particular, our enhanced KS method achieves a median absolute error and 25-75 percentile range of 0.22(0.16 - 0.64) bpm, as compared with 0.35(0.28 0.89) bpm from our previous KS fusion method and 1.1(0.3 2.6) bpm from the best reference method in the literature (Karlen et al. 2013).",60105589,Laboratoire Traitement du Signal et de l'Image,Rennes,France,['1700'],21.444444444444443,0.08637254901960786,0.4891176470588236,1

In this paper, we present a distributionally robust release planning model that allows planned lead time probability estimates to vary over a specified ambiguity set. We evaluate the performance of non-robust and robust approaches using a simulation model of a scaled-down wafer fabrication facility. We examine the effect of increasing uncertainty in the estimated lead time parameters on the objective function value and compare the worst-case, average optimality, and feasibility of the two approaches.

The leading counting approaches start from point annotations per object from which they construct density maps. Then, their training objective transforms input images to density maps through deep convolutional networks. We posit that the point annotations serve more supervision purposes than just constructing density maps. We introduce ways to repurpose the points for free. First, we propose supervised focus from segmentation, where points are converted into binary maps. The binary maps are combined with a network branch and accompanying loss function to focus on areas of interest. Second, we propose supervised focus from global density, where the ratio of point annotations to image pixels is used in another branch to regularize the overall density estimation. To assist both the density estimation and the focus from segmentation, we also introduce an improved kernel size estimator for the point annotations. Experiments on six datasets show that all our contributions reduce the counting error, regardless of the base network, resulting in state-of-the-art accuracy using only a single network.

Indeed, it has been observed that missing data patterns hold relevant information regarding the patient health state. To take advantage of this information, we propose a sepsis detection model incorporating representations of missingness information.

First, the model is trained by simply imputing missing values in the dataset. Then, the dataset is extended with the pattern of missing values.

A major implication of the model is that individual preferences of similarity lead to a collective segregation behavior. Schelling used Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) with uni-dimensional agents. In reality, people are multidimensional. This raises the question of whether multi-dimensionality can boost stability or reduce segregation in society. In this paper, we first adopt ABM to reconstruct Schelling's original model and discuss its convergence behaviors under different threshold levels. Then, we extend Schelling's model with multidimensional agents and investigate convergence behaviors of the model. Results suggest that if agents have high levels of demand for identical neighbors, the society might become less stable or even chaotic. Also, several experiments suggest that multidimensional agents are able to form a stable society that is not segregated, if agents prefer to stay adjacent to not only identical but also similar neighbors.",60015574,"The University of Tennessee, Knoxville",Knoxville,United States,"['1712', '1706']",16.333333333333336,0.0933974358974359,0.43192307692307697,1

We propose a model of the cardiovascular system composed of i) cardiac electrical activity, ii) elastance-based mechanical activity, iii) systemic and pulmonary circulations and iv) heart valves. An identification strategy was implemented using a leave-one-out cross validation approach in order to estimate patient-specific LV pressures for 4 patients suffering from AS. LV pressure curve is then used for the estimation of PSL. A close match was observed between experimental and simulated LV pressures for all 4 patients. The global root mean square error (RMSE) is equal to 20.34 (± 5.34) mmHg. RMSE for systolic and diastolic arterial pressures are respectively 0.89 (± 0.79) and 0.2370 (± 0.18) mmHg. Mean PSL areas calculated for experimental and model-based pressures are respectively 1965.6 ± 206.77 cm2 and 2206.4 ± 289.64 cm2. The proposed model-based method may be a useful tool to improve the noninvasive estimation of LV pressure and the characterization of LV function on patients with severe AS.",60105589,Laboratoire Traitement du Signal et de l'Image,Rennes,France,['1700'],19.77777777777778,-0.014583333333333332,0.21875,1
580,580,Simulating Maritime Chokepoint Disruption in the Global Food Supply,"The crops of wheat, maize, and rice make up almost two-thirds of the world's dietary needs. Additionally, soybeans account for three-quarters of global livestock feed. Considering over half of the world's exported supply of these commodities is exported via maritime means, the free flow of marine traffic becomes paramount. Current optimization models found in a number of studies involving food commodities lack the ability to capture the inherent variance in maritime transport. To capture this variance, a discrete-event simulation was built to understand how disruptions in this system impact those who rely on its unhindered functionality. Monthly export data are used, and the maritime chokepoints of the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal, and the Strait of Gibraltar are modeled for disruption. Results indicate significant food shortages for all importers studied. Marine traffic through the Strait of Malacca was also significantly impacted when any of the three chokepoints studied were closed.",60020251,United States Air Force Institute of Technology,Wright-Patterson AFB,United States,"['1712', '1706']",18.75,0.12619047619047621,0.45952380952380956,1
581,581,Predicting Plausible Human Purkinje Network Morphology from Simulations,"The Purkinje network (PN) gains more clinically importance as it becomes target for pacing in rate control and defibrination. However, our understanding of the PN morphology arises from animal experiments, which might not transfer to humans. Therefore, we propose an automated computer simulation predicting physiological PN morphologies depending on the heart shape. It starts by generating virtual heart shapes from a statistical shape atlas and generates virtual PNs on the endocardial surface. For the combined virtual models the eikonal equation is solved to estimate the local activation times throughout the myocardium, which then feed forward to an simulation of the 12-lead surface ECG. From the simulated ECG the QRS-complex is compared against a healthy standard QRS-complex, which allows to estimate how physiological a PN morphology is.In our model, only bundle branch bifurcation points near the base or near the apex result in physiological QRS wave forms. For the right bundle, more physiological QRS waves can be obtained when the branching point is at the apex. Only a minor dependency of the ECG on the heart shape is found. However, a strong correlation between the bundle branch bifurcation points themselves is observed.",60025488,The University of Utah,Salt Lake City,United States,['1700'],21.22222222222222,0.1206959706959707,0.5206959706959707,1

However, the method has to be improved to simulate sinus rhythm because the His-Purkinje system is involved. Therefore, a correct anatomical representation of the complete cardiac surface including endocardial electro-anatomical structures may be relevant. Comparing models with and without these electro-anatomical structures, the initial estimation of the cardiac activation sequence was often similar. However, the estimation of initial foci in the extensive model was more similar to initial foci known from in vitro and invasive mapping studies. Therefore, incorporation of electro-anatomical structures may improve robustness of modeling cardiac activation sequences with His-Purkinje involvement.",60032724,University Medical Center Utrecht,Utrecht,Netherlands,['1700'],19.833333333333332,0.08666666666666667,0.2288888888888889,1

The framework consists of two models: (i) probabilistic service life prediction models for determining the time to repair, and (ii) probabilistic life cycle assessment (LCA) models for measuring the impact of a repair. Specifically, this paper introduces a new mathematical approach, SIPmath, to simplify this design framework and potentially accelerate adoption by civil infrastructure designers.

We propose in this study the application of an original multi-feature probabilistic detector (MFPD) for SAS event detection during long-term monitoring recordings on three SAS patients. The nasal pressure signal is used as input to derive a set of respiratory features (variance, peak-to-peak amplitude and total respiration cycle) which are statistically characterized during time and used to provide a mono-feature detection probability in realtime. A centralized fusion approach based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), optimally combines these mono-feature distributions in order to produce a final detection. While the optimal feature set selection lies beyond the scope of our study, we illustrate the ability to adapt each feature's weight dynamically to make centralized fusion decisions. The method can be directly applied to data acquired from multiple sensors as long as features are synchronized. Our proposed fusion method achieves a very high sensitivity (94%) as compared with reference thresholding based methods in the literature.",60105589,Laboratoire Traitement du Signal et de l'Image,Rennes,France,['1700'],26.714285714285715,0.05644444444444444,0.5418888888888889,1

However, parallelism and instabilities in the production process cause scrambling in the order sequence. The stability of the order sequence can be increased by using sequencing buffers between the individual production units. In the automobile industry, all sequencing buffers frequently share one large automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) with limited capacity. In existing approaches for dimensioning sequencing buffers, this shared capacity restriction is not considered, even though the optimal distribution of buffer capacity might be an important lever for increasing the sequence stability. Therefore, the focus of this paper is the identification of the optimal capacity distribution between several sequencing buffers using the same storage area.

590,590,Multi-level bottom-top and top-bottom feature fusion for crowd counting,"Crowd counting presents enormous challenges in the form of large variation in scales within images and across the dataset. These issues are further exacerbated in highly congested scenes. Approaches based on straightforward fusion of multi-scale features from a deep network seem to be obvious solutions to this problem. However, these fusion approaches do not yield significant improvements in the case of crowd counting in congested scenes. This is usually due to their limited abilities in effectively combining the multi-scale features for problems like crowd counting. To overcome this, we focus on how to efficiently leverage information present in different layers of the network. Specifically, we present a network that involves: (i) a multi-level bottom-top and top-bottom fusion (MBTTBF) method to combine information from shallower to deeper layers and vice versa at multiple levels, (ii) scale complementary feature extraction blocks (SCFB) involving cross-scale residual functions to explicitly enable flow of complementary features from adjacent conv layers along the fusion paths. Furthermore, in order to increase the effectiveness of the multi-scale fusion, we employ a principled way of generating scale-aware ground-truth density maps for training. Experiments conducted on three datasets that contain highly congested scenes (ShanghaiTech, UCF-CC-50, and UCF-QNRF) demonstrate that the proposed method is able to outperform several recent methods in all the datasets.",60005248,Johns Hopkins University,Baltimore,United States,"['1712', '1707']",23.666666666666668,0.07189285714285716,0.4425714285714285,1

The features associated with each hour are analyzed independently. A sigmoid function is used for the activation functions, RMSprop for the optimizer functions, and categorical cross entropy for the loss function. We have found that this setup works best for our current method and leads to the highest accuracy with minimal loss.Results: By testing our algorithm on a subset of the given dataset we achieved a validation score of 0.038. The official score received from the competition (under the team name ""Whitaker's Warriors"") was 0.022 placing us 65th out of the 78 scored entries.Conclusions: Achieving a positive utility score of 0.022 shows our method of combining PCA with a quick SOFA score and classifying with a neural network is a promising approach.

594,594,Estimation of Cardiac Time Intervals from the Mechanical Activity of the Heart Using Machine Learning,"Pre-ejection period (PEP) and total systolic time (TST) are hemodynamic indices which provide vital information about left ventricular performance. In this study, we suggested a method for estimating PEP and TST using the features extracted from the mechanical activity of the heart without finding the fiducial points associated with the opening and closure of heart valves. We recorded seismocardiogram (SCG) and gyrocardiogram (GCG) signals from 50 healthy subjects using a 3-axial micro-electromechanical joint accelerometer-gyroscope sensor. For each axis of the SCG and GCG signals, 18 features were extracted per cardiac cycle. Several regression models were implemented using the features from multiple combinations of SCG and GCG and were validated against the measurements from tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) as the reference. The model that was fitted over the SCG z-axis features provided the most accurate estimates for PEP and TST intervals with the root mean square error of 9.5 and 17.2 millisecond, respectively. The estimation of cardiac time intervals investigated in this study broadens the potential of SCG and GCG in the monitoring of cardiovascular performance.

595,595,Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels Inhibition in Autonomically Stimulated Human Atrial Myocytes,"The autonomic nervous system has been reported to play a major role in the generation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. Various investigations have suggested small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels as potential targets for more effective pharmacological therapies. In this study, we used in silico modeling and simulation to investigate the effects of SK channel inhibition on the action potential (AP) of autonomically stimulated human atrial cardiomyocytes. The Grandi AP model, with a new formulation for the ISK current, was used to represent human atrial electrophysiology. Choliner-gic stimulation by different concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) hyperpolarized the AP and shortened the AP duration (APD) in a dose-dependent manner, with up to 7 mV resting membrane potential elevation and >200 ms APD shortening for 1 μM ACh at 1 Hz pacing frequency. Additional β-adrenergic stimulation by 1 μM Isoproterenol (Iso) partially attenuated the effects of cholinergic stimulation by prolonging the APD by 41.6%. ISK inhibition was able to reverse the effects of cholinergic activation, but only for moderate ACh doses and when combined with 1 μM Iso, leading to 58.3% prolongation of the AP stimulated with 0.01 μM ACh. In conclusion, ISK inhibition combined with β-adrenergic stimulation can be effective in antagonizing cholinergic effects on human atrial myocytes.",60016809,Universidad de Zaragoza,Zaragoza,Spain,['1700'],25.625,0.126255980861244,0.5568181818181818,1
596,596,Bayesian loss for crowd count estimation with point supervision,"In crowd counting datasets, each person is annotated by a point, which is usually the center of the head. And the task is to estimate the total count in a crowd scene. Most of the state-of-the-art methods are based on density map estimation, which convert the sparse point annotations into a 'ground truth' density map through a Gaussian kernel, and then use it as the learning target to train a density map estimator. However, such a 'ground-truth' density map is imperfect due to occlusions, perspective effects, variations in object shapes, etc. On the contrary, we propose Bayesian loss, a novel loss function which constructs a density contribution probability model from the point annotations. Instead of constraining the value at every pixel in the density map, the proposed training loss adopts a more reliable supervision on the count expectation at each annotated point. Without bells and whistles, the loss function makes substantial improvements over the baseline loss on all tested datasets. Moreover, our proposed loss function equipped with a standard backbone network, without using any external detectors or multi-scale architectures, plays favourably against the state of the arts.

In multistage systems, these quantiles cannot be calculated analytically. In such cases, simulation can provide useful estimates, but computing a simulation-based quantile at the time of a job release decision is impractical. We explore a metamodeling approach based on efficient experiment design that can allow, after an offline learning phase, a metamodel estimate for the state-dependent lead time quantile. This allows for real time control if the metamodel is accurate, and computationally fast. In preliminary testing of a three-stage production system we find high accuracy for quadratic and cubic regression metamodels.

From this decomposition, a better estimation of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and the sympathovagal balance (SB) can be achieved. These estimates are first analyzed during autonomic blockade and an orthostatic maneuver, and then compared against the classical HRV and a model that considers only linear interactions. Results are evaluated using surrogate data analysis and they indicate that the classical HRV and the linear model underestimate the cardiorespiratory interactions. Moreover, the linear and nonlinear interactions appear to be mediated by different control mechanisms.

Therefore, utilizing computer modelling, this study was to quantify the pro-arrhythmogenic effects of PITX2 overexpression in the human atrium at cell and tissue levels. In simulations, Courtemanche et al.'s model of human atrial cell AP was modified to incorporate experimental data on changes of IKs and ICaL induced by PITX2 overexpression. The cell models for normal and AF type ionic currents (IKs and ICaL) were incorporated into the homogeneous multicellular 2D tissue model. Effects of electrical remodelling induced by PITX2 overexpression were quantified on ionic currents, AP profile and AP duration (APD). Dynamic behaviors of re-entrant excitation waves in the 2D model were characterized. It was shown that the PITX2 overexpression abbreviated atrial APD. In the 2D model, the PITX2 overexpression also stabilized and accelerated re-entrant excitation waves, leading to rapid and sustained re-entry.

In addition, applying the monitoring hardware requires additional patient preparation time. In order to avoid these drawbacks, this work makes use of the ballistocardiographic (BCG) effect for obtaining a heart rate estimate.To measure body motions caused by the BCG effect, an inflated air cushion was integrated into the MRI's patient table. An external pressure sensor detected the pressure changes caused by the BCG effect. A synchronously acquired ECG was used as a reference. Five subjects were included in this preliminary study. The measurements were performed inside a 3 T MRI scanner.Taking the ECG as reference or gold-standard, heart beats in the BCG were detected with sensitivity of 91.7 % and a positive predictive value of 93.9 %.This preliminary study showed the feasibility of using BCG signals for patient monitoring during MRI exams. In conclusion, this approach enables patient monitoring during MRI exams and eliminates the time-consuming patient preparation.",60018362,Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg,Magdeburg,Germany,['1700'],19.6,0.10939393939393942,0.6078787878787878,1

Moreover, they are systems of systems wherein understanding is available in localized contexts only and that too is typically partial and uncertain. With the overall system behaviour hard to know a-priori and conventional techniques for system-wide analysis either lacking in rigour or defeated by the scale of the problem, the current practice often exclusively relies on human expertise for monitoring and adaptation. We present an approach that combines ideas from modeling & simulation, reinforcement learning and control theory to make enterprises adaptive.

606,606,Cardiac Resynchronization Guided by Ultra-High-Frequency ECG Maps,"Here we present a technique based on 14-lead ultrahigh-frequency electrocardiogram (UHF-ECG, 5 kHz) able to measure the immediate effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) settings on electrical ventricular dyssynchrony.Resting UHF-ECGs were sequentially recorded during different CRT settings: CRT OFF, CRT ON, VV delays 0, -20, -40 ms, and SMART sensing (Boston Scientific) in 33 patients. Electrical depolarization maps were computed from signal-averaged UHF-ECGs in the frequency band 150-1000 Hz. The horizontal axis of each map indicates time and the vertical axis indicates the activation location (V1-V8 lead). The red areas show the location-time of the maximal volume of simultaneously depolarized myocardial cells.The optimal CRT setting is characterized by a narrow and vertical activation pattern. Optimal CRT setting selected by a physician from electrical depolarization maps corresponded to the minimal mechanical intraventricular delay obtained from echocardiography in 61% of patients; in 27% of patients the difference was within a 10 ms interval.UHF-ECG depolarization maps represent a useful tool for the selection and setting of optimal cardiac resynchronization therapy.",60068899,St. Anne's University Hospital Brno,Brno,Czech Republic,['1700'],33.4,0.06142857142857141,0.2867857142857143,1

Traditional performance metrics such as CPU, memory and bandwidth usage for scaling up or down resources are not sufficient for all applications. For example, modeling and simulation experimentation is usually expected to yield results within a specific timeframe. In order to achieve this, often the quality of experiments is compromised either by restricting the parameter space to be explored or by limiting the number of replications required to give statistical confidence.

Propofol anesthesia is known to preserve CA, although information on the anesthesia effect on MCBFV and MAP variability coupling at sedation levels typical of major cardiac surgery is limited. MAP and MCBFV time series were respectively recorded from radial artery and left middle cerebral artery via transcranial Doppler, before (PRE) and after (POST) general anesthesia induction with propofol and remifentanil in 10 male subjects (age 64.7±7.0 years) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Squared coherence (K2) was computed in the typical bands of CA, namely very low (0.02-0.07 Hz), low (0.07-0.15 Hz) and high frequency (0.15-0.4 Hz). The null hypothesis of coupling was tested through a surrogate analysis associating MAP and MCBFV series taken from different patients in the same experimental condition. MAP and MCBFV original series were significantly more associated than surrogate ones during PRE. K2 was reduced in the three frequency bands during POST to a level comparable with surrogates. By decoupling MCBFV and MAP propofol general anesthesia favors situations of stable MCBFV in response to slow modifications of MAP but the full decoupling might hide the limited resources of the cerebrovascular control to actively regulate MCBFV.",60103762,IRCCS Foundation Rome,Rome,Italy,['1700'],26.0,0.002519047619047623,0.3806285714285714,1

610,610,Numerical study on mechanisms of soy protein as a functional modifier for polymer materials,"In the past decades, to meet the increasing demands for protecting the environments, taking bio-degradable green materials as alternatives to traditional petroleum-based polymer materials has become a global interest. From the previous studies, it is demonstrated that soy protein-based biomaterial is one of the promising candidates to be used as functional modifier for polymers, due to the complex structures of protein and diverse interactions with polymers. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation is a power tool and can provide insights in understanding the conformational changes of protein molecules, as well as the interactions between proteins and polymers. In this study, 11S molecule of soy protein is chosen as a representative, and three different denaturation processes are applied via MD simulation, including heat denaturation at two temperatures and the breaking of disulfide bonds. It is observed that by controlling the denaturation conditions, the structures and properties of the protein molecules can be manipulated. Low temperature condition has limited impacts on the structures and properties of 11S molecules; high temperature process, on the other hand, is found to lead to an intensive secondary phase transition of the molecules; moreover, by breaking the disulfide bonds, the hydrophobic residues of the molecules can be largely exposed, potentially forming strong interactions with the hydrophobic poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer. Besides, different protein-polymer interactions could result in various property-modification effects on PVDF polymer. For instance, due to the strong interaction between PVDF and the protein molecule denatured without disulfide bonds, the dipole moment of PVDF at the interface is largely enhanced, and the polarizability under external electric fields is also improved, which is in agreement with experimental result.",60000745,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Urbana,United States,['1706'],30.555555555555557,0.003685714285714281,0.41859999999999997,1

612,612,Early Prediction of Sepsis Considering Early Warning Scoring Systems,"Sepsis is a noted cause of mortality in hospitalised patients, particularly patients in the ICU. Early prediction of sepsis facilitates a better targeted therapy which in turn reduces patient mortality rates. This study developed a methodology to allow automatic prediction of sepsis 6 hours prior to its clinical presentation. For this purpose, four vital signs comprising of HR, SBP, Temperature and respiratory rate, along with laboratory results for Platelets, WBC, Glucose and Creatinine are scored using Prehospital Early Sepsis Detection (PRESEP) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Early Warning Scoring (EWS) systems or screening tools and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria to allow under-sampling. The weighted scores obtained from the screening tools are also used to categorise patients into 4 groups with different probabilities of facing sepsis in ICU. The hourly data of each group is then trained through a KNN classifier to detect sepsis hours. The ensemble of classifiers are used to predict sepsis in all available dataset. The proposed model developed by UlsterTeam is trained on training setA and evaluated on training setB.

The spectral power at the low frequency (LF) band [0.04, 0.15] Hz and at the high frequency band centered around the mean respiratory rate, estimated from ECG-derived respiration signals, are studied. The mean heart rate (HR), the total power of HRV, and the normalized LF power are also analyzed.Results show that mean HR and normalized LF power increase significantly after basal stage, not only during the sauna sessions, but also at the intermediate short rest stages and recovery phase after 30 min. A significant reduction in the total power of HRV during all sauna sessions is observed, while an increased power in LF band is shown only during recovery which might be related to improved cardiac function (increased cardiac output and reduced peripheral vascular resistance) after heat exposure. Respiratory rate does not change significantly during the protocol but a negative trend at stress stages may indicate a reverse reaction against an over-activation of the sympathetic branch. In conclusion, exposure to heat stress shifts sympathovagal balance of ANS toward sympathetic dominance that increases HR and diminishes HRV.",60107758,Lithuanian Sports University,Kaunas,Lithuania,['1700'],35.833333333333336,0.053514492753623195,0.6033695652173914,1

616,616,Modeling and Classification of the ST Segment Morphology for Enhanced Detection of Acute Myocardial Infarction,"A number of cardiac conditions such as acute pericarditis (PC) and early repolarization (ER) cause ST elevation which mimics ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). Current guidelines recommend analyzing ST segment morphology to distinguish STEMI from these confounders. ST elevation in PC and ER (and possibly in STEMI) is concave (upward) in the JTpeak interval, while a convex or straight ECG ST segment is associated with the diagnosis of STEMI. We developed an algorithm to classify concavity characteristic of the ST segment. A quadratic polynomial regression algorithm was introduced to model the shape of JTpeak interval. Our diagnostic algorithm generated representative beats and measured the fiducial points and standard measurements such as ST level in 12-lead 10-sec segments of ECG recordings. JTpeak interval was modeled by a parabola using a least-squares polynomial regression algorithm. Classifier features such as curvature, parabola direction and vertex, model fit error, and the noise measure were determined. A bootstrap-aggregated tree ensemble classifier determined the ST segment shape. Our algorithm was evaluated on a 12-lead ECG database collected in two medical centers.

618,618,Analysis of Signal-Averaged Electrocardiogram Performance for Body Surface Recordings,"To test the performance of signal averaging on body surface electrocardiograms (SAECG), a comparative analysis of four sources of perturbation, 1) uncorrelated noise, 2) beat alignment, 3) physiological variability and 4) respiratory movement was performed. The first two cases were assessed using a computer model of a ventricular beat. The other two cases were tested using high resolution body surface signals recorded from a torso tank (N=2) and patient data (N=4) respectively. In the first case, SAECG successfully removed a high level of noise made up of white Gaussian noise (WGN) with σ = 10 μV and 50 Hz noise with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 9 dB since the root mean square error of the noise (RMSEnoise) was 0.65 ± 0.01 μV and 1.30 ± 0.01 μV, respectively. The RMSE of the averaged QRS (RMSESAQRS) was slightly changed by physiological variability (RMSESAQRS =4.18 ± 1.38 μV) when comparing the SAQRS resulting from the average of 100 different beats taken from the same recording. While SAQRS are distorted by respiration artefacts, the beats selected during the exhalation phase produced the least distortion to the SAQRS with a RMSESAQRS = 16.28 ± 12.58 μV. To conclude, SAECG can efficiently de-noise signals in presence of uncorrelated noise without distorting the SAQRS. However, respiration motion introduces amplitude shift between SAQRS.",60102125,Université de Bordeaux,Bordeaux,France,['1700'],27.375,0.03438888888888889,0.37672222222222224,1

Second, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) distance is proposed in form of intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) number in order to reduce the loss of preference information. And generalized IVIF number is also defined. Combining with prospect theory, the IF prospect matrix of different cluster is obtained by conversion.

To this end, we show using simulation that it is important to be careful when using finite queue sizes, especially in a heavy traffic setting. Using simulation we demonstrate that the correlation between LES and the virtual waiting time can differ from heavy traffic results and can therefore have a large impact on the optimal announcement. Finally, we use simulation to assess the value of giving future information in computing correlations with virtual waiting times and show that future information is helpful in some settings.",60007776,Cornell University,Ithaca,United States,"['1712', '1706']",30.0,-0.01941964285714285,0.5517113095238095,1

I-AVB is characterized by a prolonged PR interval. However, due to various artifacts and diversity of ECG morphology, existing ECG delineation algorithms is unable to provide robust measurement of the PR interval. Deep neural network is good at extracting high-level feature from ECG waveform, but merely using waveform as input of neural network may aggravate overfitting when lack of I-AVB records. In this paper, we propose a multimodal-input deep learning method to effectively detect I-AVB from 12-lead ECG records. We utilize ECG waveform and delineation result as the multimodal input of neural network.

This deviation can cause the failure of AF detection but its effect has not been quantified. This study addressed this concern and analyzed the anti-interference abilities of 14 commonly used AF features. Two types of Experiment were performed on the MIT-BIH AF database to simulate the deviation caused by QRS detection: 1) randomly moving forward or back several (0-15) labeled QRS locations to stimulate false detections, and 2) randomly missing several (0-9) labeled QRS locations to stimulate missing QRS detections.

The technique follows a statistical approach whereby we generate continuous fibre tracts across the tissue and couple adjacent fibres stochastically if they are within a given distance of each other. By varying the connection distance, we identify which regions are most susceptible to forming re-entrant circuits if muscle fibres are uncoupled, through the action of fibrosis or otherwise. Our results highlight the sleeves of the pulmonary veins, the posterior left atrium and the left atrial appendage as the regions most susceptible to re-entrant circuit formation.

In PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019, we integrate Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and ensemble learning to achieve early sepsis prediction. Specifically, we tackle the problem of class imbalance and data missing firstly, and then we manually extract features according to the prior knowledge from the medical field. In addition, we regard the prediction of sepsis as a time series prediction problem and pre-train LSTM-based models as feature extractors to obtain the ""deep"" features on time series that might be related to the onset of sepsis. Manual features and ""deep"" features are then used to train prediction models under the framework of ensemble learning, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) regressor.

631,631,Direct Mapping from Body Surface Potentials to Cardiac Activation Maps Using Neural Networks,Cardiac mapping is an important diagnostic tool to understand cardiac arrhythmias caused by an electrical disorder. One of its procedures is the activation mapping which consists on generating a map of the depolarization sequence. This map is constructed from the electrograms (EGMs). These latter signals are either recorded invasively through catheterization or non-invasively reconstructed using inverse methods. Our purpose is to evaluate the performance of artificial neural networks on reconstructing activation maps non-invasively directly from body surface potentials (BSPs) without providing the electrograms. We suggest a basic architecture of a neural network. The method is evaluated using simulated atrial data.,60106842,Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux,Talence,France,['1700'],14.285714285714286,-0.02857142857142856,0.3607142857142857,1

However, teaching an agent to perform human-like grasping of objects is still a challenge in the robotics community. In this work, natural hand poses (i.e., priors) according to the shape of objects are used in training an agent via Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). To validate the effect of humanlike grasping priors, the agent is trained to perform object grasping and relocation tasks including a single apple, milk box, and can. The results show that the trained agent with human-like hand pose priors in DRL is able to grasp the objects more naturally and performs object relocation with significantly improved success rate against the trained agent with only DRL.",60072061,Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral Ecuador,Guayaquil,Ecuador,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",25.8,0.10025510204081634,0.42959183673469387,1

However, monitoring applications typically utilize 40 Hz low-pass filtered ECG data. The extend to which the value of the MSVG is affected by the utilization of 40 Hz low-pass monitoring ECG filters over the commonly used 150 Hz low-pass resting ECG filters has not previously been reported.The aim of this research was to quantify the differences between MSVG values computed using 40 Hz low-pass filtered ECG data (MSVG40) and 150 Hz low-pass filtered ECG data (MSVG150). The differences between the MSVG40 and the MSVG150 were quantified as systematic error (mean difference) and random error (span of Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement) using a study population of 726 subjects. The systematic error was found to be 0.013 mV ms [95% confidence interval: 0.008 mV ms to 0.018 mV ms].

634,634,A Multi-Task Imputation and Classification Neural Architecture for Early Prediction of Sepsis from Multivariate Clinical Time Series,"Early prediction of sepsis onset can notify clinicians to provide timely interventions to patients to improve their clinical outcomes. The key question motivating this work is: given a retrospective patient cohort consisting of multivariate clinical time series (e.g., vital signs and lab measurement) and patients' demographics, how to build a model to predict the onset of sepsis six hours earlier? To tackle this challenge, we first used a recurrent imputation for time series (RITS) approach to impute missing values in multivariate clinical time series. Second, we applied temporal convolutional networks (TCN) to the RITS-imputed data. Compared to other sequence prediction models, TCN can effectively control the size of sequence history. Third, when defining the loss function, we assigned custom time- dependent weights to different types of errors. We achieved 9th place (team name = prna, utility score = 0.328) at the 2019 PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge, which evaluated our proposed model on a real-world sepsis patient cohort.

635,635,A New Entropy-Based Heart Failure Detector,"Heart failure is a common type of clinical cardiovascular disease and has a high prevalence, disability and fatality rate. Entropy measures, typically as sample entropy (SampEn), has been used in clinic for detecting heart failure. However, SampEn values are sensitive to the selection of threshold r, resulting in a difficulty in the clinical interpretation. This study proposed a new entropy measure named sample difference entropy (SampDEn), for distinguishing congestive heart failure (CHF) patients from normal sinus rhythm (NSR) subjects. Unlike SampEn, the new SampDEn calculated the entropy value by comparing the information increase rate at two threshold settings of rmax and rmin, to reduce the statistical instability of SampEn due to the single threshold decision. The new algorithm was tested on the MIT-BIH RR Interval Databases. For 300 RR interval time series, the new proposed SampDEn reported an accuracy of 70.46% while SampEn reported 69.18%, 60.47%, 51.21% and 43.27% for r=0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.25 respectively.

637,637,An In-Silico Study of the Effects of Conductance Variation on the Regionally Based Action Potential Morphology,"Improved understanding of the effects of variability in electrophysiological activity within the human heart is key to understanding and predicting cardiovascular response to disease and treatments. Previous studies have considered either regional variation in action potentials or inter-subject variability within a single region of the atria. In this study, we hypothesize that the regional differences in morphology derive not only from variation in dependence on individual conductances, but also from the relationship between multiple conductances.Using the Monte-Carlo Sampling Method and the Maleckar cellular model for electrophysiology, we created an in-silico population of models. Each conductance was varied +/- 100% from the standard model. The population was divided into regional groups based on biomarkers.Results showed regional variation in the dependence on relationships between conductances. In the right atrial appendage the value of gK1 was found to be only twice as influential as the relationship between gK1 and gKur on the APD90 biomarker. Other relationships that had a significant impact included gTo-gKur; gKr-gK1; gNaK-gNaCa and gKur-gNaK for various regions. R2 values for first order linear regression models showed significant relationships were left out in the analysis.

ASTRO incorporates adaptively sampled function and gradient estimates within a trust-region framework to generate iterates that are guaranteed to converge almost surely to a first-order or a second-order critical point of the objective function. Efficiency in ASTRO stems from two key aspects: (i) adaptive sampling to ensure that the objective function and its gradient are sampled only to the extent needed, so that small sample sizes result when iterates are far from a critical point and large sample sizes result when iterates are near a critical point; and (ii) quasi-Newton Hessian updates using BFGS.

642,642,Shape reconstruction of woven fabrics using fiber bragg grating strain sensors,"In this paper we develop a methodology that uses in-plane strain measurements to determine out-of-plane deflection for woven fabrics using an optical fiber based sensor network. A multiplexed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) network is used to collect strain at discrete locations in the fabric. To simplify the problem a circularly shaped two-dimensional woven fabric material under a spherical indenter load is studied. A finite element (FE) model of the fabric behavior, derived from benchmark testing, was used to help develop reconstruction algorithms, some of which account for slipping of the fabric at the clamped boundaries. Due to the large deflections, complex material behavior of the fabric and slipping of the fabric at the outer boundaries, a modified empirical approximation approach was found to be the optimal choice for the deflection reconstruction. Experiments are performed to evaluate one of the algorithms on strain data from FBG sensors for two test cases: bonded to and woven into the fabric. Despite the complex strain on the FBGs bonded to the fabric, the empirical approach well predicts the out-of-plane deflection, except in the region under the indentor, where the fabric deformation was different than that modeled in the FE simulations. This result is promising for structural applications were direct observations of the out-of-plane deflections are not possible. To increase the maximum deflection of the fabric that could be measured, weaving of the FBGs into the fabric is also attempted. This method was less successful, due to the large amount of relative slipping between the optical fiber and the fabric, drastically reducing the strain measured by the FBGs.",60004923,NC State University,Raleigh,United States,['1711'],26.3,0.013784461152882215,0.3433583959899749,1

This is particularly challenging in academic medical centers and large health systems where providers have responsibilities outside of clinical duties. This leads to inconsistent use of clinic space, staff, and other fixed resources in addition to high variability in operational performance measures. In this paper we present a discrete-event simulation model used to evaluate heuristics for scheduling providers within a specialty clinic.

Although the optimal order quantity can be calculated, experiments reveal that decision makers often do not select the optimal quantity. These decision biases have been well studied, but analysis of the financial risk associated with these suboptimal decisions is limited. This paper examines the impact on profit by comparing the expected profit of suboptimal decisions with that of optimal decisions. We first conduct a literature review of behavioral results in the newsvendor setting. We use the results reported in the literature to determine parameters in a model for behavioral newsvendor decision making. We then build a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates the behavioral decision making model, heterogeneity of decision makers, and parameters of the newsvendor decision to calculate the expected profit loss.

However, it is known that in general, such models have approximations that do not consider several details of the real world. Because the multiprocessing system in consideration uses database queries (and also uses preemption resume priority) and has a certain degree of complexity, our approach uses an approximate analytical model that is validated by a discrete-event simulation model (and vice-versa).

646,646,Sepsis Prediction Model Based on Vital Signs Related Features,"In this paper, we present our solution for early detection of sepsis by joining the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019.

The first model uses 64 features and is applied if the patient stays in ICU for the first 9 hours. Second and third models use 111 more advanced features. The second prediction model is activated if the patient stays for more than 9 hours. The third one is activated for more extended stays if the patient stays for more than 60 hours. The time patients spent in the ICU or were hospitalized is an essential indicator for the risk of developing sepsis. During the longer stays in hospital number of intravenous measurements and other procedures increases, increasing the risk of blood infection. Therefore, feature extraction in our algorithm was based on these metrics.

648,648,"Cracking the 'Sepsis' Code: Assessing Time Series Nature of EHR Data, and Using Deep Learning for Early Sepsis Prediction","On a yearly basis, sepsis costs US hospitals more than any other health condition. A majority of patients who suffer from sepsis are not diagnosed at the time of admission. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are vital to improve outcomes for these patients, as each hour of delayed treatment is associated with increased mortality. In this study our goal is to predict sepsis 12 hours before its diagnosis using vitals and blood tests routinely taken in the ICU. We have investigated the performance of several machine learning algorithms including XGBoost, CNN, CNN-LSTM and CNN-XGBoost. Contrary to our expectations, XGBoost outperforms all of the sequential models and yields the best hour-by-hour prediction, perhaps due to the way we imputed missing values, losing signal that relates to the time-series nature of the EHR data. We added feature engineering to detect change points in tests and vitals, resulting in 5% improvement in XGBoost. Our team, USF-Sepsis-Phys, achieved a utility score of 0.22 (untuned threshold) and an average of the three reported AUCs (test sets A, B, C) of 0.82.

However, little is known about the significance of right atrial (RA) dysfunction on disease progression in PAH. In this context, there has been growing interest in markers of RA myocardial dysfunction. Speckle tracking echocardiography, which has been principally used to measure the myocardial strain, is technically challenging in the RA due to the thin atrial wall. Feature tracking cardiovascular magnetic resonance (FT-CMR) software designed to derive myocardial strain from CMR cine images has become available for measurements of atrial longitudinal strain. However, in subjects with relatively vigorous tricuspid annular motion, contour tracking of the RA free wall segment adjacent to the tricuspid valve is adversely affected and becomes the source of errors. In contrast to FT-CMR, we present a rapid assessable strain parameter that requires the automatic tracking of only 3 anatomical reference points - thus avoiding the segment contour tracking near the insertion of the anterior leaflet into the tricuspid annulus.",60095034,Duke-NUS Medical School Singapore,Singapore City,Singapore,['1700'],24.571428571428573,0.1049107142857143,0.5330357142857143,1

Its practical feasibility and the measurement accuracy were demonstrated in-vivo using a custom image-free ultrasound device, with the Bramwell-Hill method as the reference.Results: The proposed technique and developed device reliably captured incremental local PWV from the carotid artery. The locus of instantaneous variations in carotid local PWV obtained using the developed model traced the reference values, with a root-mean-square-error lesser than 0.05 m/s.

652,652,A Ventricular Far-Field Artefact Filtering Technique for Atrial Electrograms,"Intracardiac atrial electrograms (EGM) are prone to ventricular far-field potentials due to ventricular depolarization. In this study, a filtering technique integrating independent component analysis (ICA) and wavelet decomposition has been proposed to significantly reduce the ventricular far-field contents while preserving the EGM morphology related to atrial activations. First, the wavelet decomposition is applied to each unipolar EGM. Then, ICA is applied to the decomposed unipolar EGM components and surface ECG template. Each independent component is cross-correlated with the simultaneously recorded ECG template and the three components with higher correlation coefficients were eliminated before applying inverse ICA. Total of 126 unipolar EGM collected from an atrial fibrillation patient have been included. Results indicate that the proposed filtering can reduce the ventricular signal power by around 17 dB (decibel). Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio is increased by approximately 17 dB after applying the proposed filtering.

653,653,Parametrizing Drug Effects with Machine Learning in a New Resonant Model of Cell Electrophysiology,"Drugs often alter the action potential morphologies of cardiac cells. These changes can induce life-threatening arrhythmias. Although models of cellular electrophysiology (EP) are widely available, we have developed a promising alternative: a novel resonant model (RM) designed around the computational strengths of non-CPU platforms such as GPU and FPGA. However, like most models, the RM requires parameterization. To effectively parameterize the RM to capture drug effects on the action potential, we have investigated a machine learning algorithm using a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN). We first designed the FFNN architecture and then found its hyperparameters using a random space search algorithm. The FFNN was trained on data obtained by blocking the 'funny current' in a detailed EP model of the human sinoatrial node (SAN). We used unseen current blockage data as an input to the FFNN for validation. The correlation coefficients between all predicted and reference AP waveform morphologies was above 0.97, with zero and close to zero p-values, indicating significant predictions. Parameters of the RM obtained from FFNN can be used to capture or predict changes in AP morphologies due to drug effects.",60112777,"Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland",Auckland,New Zealand,['1700'],18.3,0.12380952380952381,0.47777777777777775,1

Method: We analysed body surface potential maps (BSPMs) from 44 subjects undergoing PTCA. BSPMs were recorded at 120 sites and these were expanded to 352 nodes (Dalhousie torso) using Laplacian interpolation. A total of 88 BSPMs were investigated. This included the 44 subjects at baseline and the 44 subjects at peak balloon inflation (PBI). At PBI the subjects had various coronary arteries occluded (14 LAD, 15 LCX, 15 RCA). All possible bipolar leads were calculated for each subject. Leads were ranked based on the maximum ST-segment change between baseline and PBI for each subject. Leads with electrode spacing of more than 100 mm were excluded. The highest ranked lead was chosen as the short spaced lead (SSL) on the anterior torso. Result: The median ST-segment change for the chosen SSL for each vessel was LAD = 134 μV, LCX = 65 μV, RCA = 166 μV. The maximum ST segment change observed for the same lead was LAD = 277 μV, LCX = 166 μV, RCA = 257 μV.

660,660,A Novel Compressed Sensing-Based Approach for Fast MRI Reconstruction from Highly Under-Sampled K-Space Data,"Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is a multiparametric imaging technique allowing the diagnosis of a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, MR acquisitions tend to be slow, limiting patient throughput and limiting potential indications for use while driving up costs. Compressed sensing (CS) is a method for reducing MR scan time, increasing image reconstruction time. In this study we formulated a novel CS-based approach to speed up reconstruction procedure. A fidelity term that constrains the solution to be similar to the acquired samples was embedded in a nonconvex weighted total variation-based approach starting from highly subsampled k-space data. This approach was tested for the reconstruction of cardiac images in 10 delayed contrast enhanced MR (DCE-MR) acquisitions, using different k-space masks. Fully sampled MR images and the reconstructed images were compared by means of peak- and signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR and SNR) metrics. Compared to other k-space filling trajectories, radial mask allowed the reconstruction of images of comparable quality (PSNR in [30 40]) but using less information. Overall, in all the test images we obtained a good reconstruction with similar SNR of the corresponding fully sampled images but using less than 20% of the original samples.",60028218,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna,Bologna,Italy,['1700'],21.444444444444443,-0.010196078431372557,0.4381372549019607,1
661,661,The Fundamentals of Domain-Specific Simulation Language Engineering,"Simulationists use a plethora of modelling languages. General-purpose languages such as C, extended with simulation constructs, give the user access to abstractions for general-purpose computation and modularization. The learning curve for experts in domains that are far from programming, however, is steep. Languages such as Modelica and DEVS allow for a more intuitive definition of models, often through visual notations and with libraries of reusable components for various domains. The semantics of these languages is fixed. While libraries can be created, the language's syntax and semantics cannot be adapted to suit the needs of a particular domain. This tutorial provides an introduction to modelling language engineering, which allows one to explicitly model all aspects -in particular, syntax and semantics- of a (domain-specific) modelling and simulation language and to subsequently synthesize appropriate tooling.

We aimed to characterize such mechanisms from the non-invasive perspective of body surface potential mapping (BSPM), using realistic computer models. Dominant frequency (DF) maps were studied to estimate the frequency of the driving mechanism and to analyze its spatio-temporal distribution of this frequency. Singularity points (SPs) were detected in phase maps and their distribution and rotational patterns were compared between arrhythmias. The driver frequencies were more expressed on the anterior portion of the torso for the right atrium and on the posterior portion for the left atrium. Rotational activity was detected in all arrhythmias, with increasing levels of spatial-temporal stability (AF, AT and AFL, respectively).

663,663,Prediction Algorithm of Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmia Validated Across Multiple Online Public Databases,"Prediction of malignant ventricular arrhythmia (mVA) is essential to prevent sudden cardiac death. There were mainly three research clusters on mVA prediction using electrocardiogram (ECG): prediction using CUDB, SDDB and private databases. Comparability and generalization issue arose due to the different usage of arrhythmic datasets for analysis. Very few studies attempted short-term prediction of mVA using multiple databases, and those studies achieved low prediction performance. Our study aims to improve the prediction performance involving multiple databases and to promote the algorithm comparability by performing more comprehensive comparability study while including a more complete set of data available from the public databases. In our study, eight statistical box count features derived from phase space reconstruction on ECG signal were classified using maximum thresholding method. This was followed by performance benchmarking against the first two clusters of existing research and a performance evaluation using the combined set of databases.

This study proposed an algorithm to extract ECG signals automatically from scanned 12 lead ECG paper recordingsThe original ECG recording images were pre-processed by operations including edge detection, image binarization and skew correction. After pre-processing, ECG waveforms were extracted from background grids based on Connected Component Analysis (CCA). For waveform segmentation, horizontal projection was applied to obtain segmentation boundaries. The ECG signal trace was then traversed to extract ECG signal time series.

When a dispatching decision is requested by the manufacturing environment, the simulation will be used to predict the possible future situation and to evaluate all job alternatives. During each alternative simulation process, once a new decision point emerges, the simulation approach will be utilized again, which is called nested alternative simulation in which a simple base rule is adopted for making decisions instead of the simulation.

However, existing models have difficulty with capturing the complex, diverse, evolving, and partially unknown dynamics in social networks, and with inferring system state from isolated observations about a tiny fraction of the individuals in the system. To solve real-world problems with a huge number of agents and system states and complicated agent interactions, we propose a stochastic kinetic model that captures complex decision-making and system dynamics using atomic events that are individually simple but together exhibit complex behaviors.

These patterns can be reconstructed by analyzing 2D and/or 3D tissue displacement data acquired using medical imaging. Here we describe an application that utilizes a 3D finite element formulation to reconstruct active stress from displacement data. As a proof of concept, a simple cubic mesh was used to represent a myocardial tissue ""sample"" consisting of a 10 x 10 x 10 lattice of nodes featuring different fiber directions that rotate with depth, mimicking cardiac transverse isotropy. In the forward model, tissue deformation was generated using a test wave with active stresses that mimic the myocardial contractile forces. The generated deformation field was used as input to an inverse model designed to reconstruct the original active stress distribution. We numerically simulated malfunctioning tissue regions (experiencing limited contractility and hence active stress) within the healthy tissue. We also assessed model sensitivity by adding noise to the deformation field generated using the forward model.

672,672,Early Prediction of Sepsis: Using State-of-the-art Machine Learning Techniques on Vital Sign Inputs,"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) give a lot of information regarding a patient's progress in health, who is admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Sepsis is a critical condition suffered by a patient who, if not treated in a timely manner can cause casualties. Machine learning algorithms have evolved to utilize EHRs to help doctors detect the onset of sepsis. In this work, we present a random forest-based ensemble machine learning technique to work on patient data, also called vital sign input, from ICU. The data we used is published as a part of the Physionet Challenge 2019 [11]. The proposed technique performs well on data that contain a major chunk as missing values due to the sparsity of measurement taken in an ICU. We used a combined classifier and an early predictor approach to accomplish the task. The classifier does the job of classification when the early prediction is not possible due to a lack of data. While early predictor predicts the onset of sepsis based on the patient's information it received from previous recordings of vital sign inputs. A utility metric score is used to evaluate the early predictor. The score increases with early predictions and decreases with late predictions as well as false alarms.

The ionic model parameters were modified to represent electrically remodeled atria, uniformly. The model was stimulated with decreasing cycle length to drive the atria to maximum rate, and simulated over 10 seconds. This was tried with 10 different pacing locations and 46 different values of the conductivity, gCaL, of the L-type calcium current.For gCaL values up to 130% of the initial value, on average 4 out of 10 pacing sites induced AF. However, the positive sites were different for each tested gCaL level, even at 1% increments. Beyond 130%, the AF induction rate decreased. Every pacing site yielded AF for a subset of parameter values, but some sites more frequently.In conclusion, AF induction is highly sensitive to parameter values.

In this context, agent-based models provide a useful ability to simulate individual behaviors and relationships among members of a population; however, agent-based models also introduce a significant data-association challenge when used with population-counting sensors that do not specifically identify agents. The main contribution of this paper is to develop an efficient method for managing the combinatorial complexity of data association.

Based on interviews with an Irish AFPSC forwarder, a simulation model was developed to investigate different systems' dynamics and operating rules under different delay patterns on the (yet non-existent) inner-Irish border. A cost analysis of varying border regimes favours a more thorough change in operations, e.g., route adjustments. This paper gives a first indication on how AFPSC forwarders in Ireland can deal with a no-deal Brexit situation.",60012873,Technological University Dublin,Dublin,Ireland,"['1712', '1706']",20.0,0.2648809523809524,0.4396825396825396,1

Creation of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building and executing visual MS applications in the cloud poses significant technical challenges. This paper presents an architecture and a design of a cloud-based visual MS IDE for the example problem domain traffic networks. The IDE consists of integrated software tools that provide computer-aided assistance in the composition and visualization of simulation models under a web browser on a client computer while the simulation model is being executed on a server computer.

679,679,Validation Risk in Hierarchical Models,Using a model as an input data source for integration into another model carries with it risks to the validity of the model composition. This paper presents research into the inherent risks of model integration. The research decomposes models into sets of semantic concepts allowing for a calculation of structural alignment. Measurable changes in a model's output due to the integration of another model provide an impact assessment. Risks to decisions arise from incompatible assumptions and constructions of models. We present a risk assessment as a tuple containing differences in models' alignment across three axes and in changes in a model's output metrics.

680,680,Simulation Based Forecast Data Generation and Evaluation of Forecast Error Measures,"Production planning is usually performed based on customer orders or demand forecasts. The demand forecasts in production systems can either be generated by manufacturing companies themselves, i.e. forecast prediction, or they can be provided by customers. For both alternatives, forecast prediction, as well as the customer-provided forecasts, the quality of those forecasts is critical for success. In this paper, a simulation model to generate forecast data that mimic different forecast behaviors is presented. In detail, an independent forecast distribution and a forecast evolution model are investigated to discuss the value of customer-provided forecasts in comparison to the simple moving average forecast prediction method. Main findings of the paper are that Root-Mean-Square-Error and Mean-Absolute-Percentage-Error describe the forecast error well if no systematic effects are present and Mean-Percentage-Error provides a good measure for systematic effects. Furthermore, systematic effects like overbooking are significantly reducing the value of customer-provided forecast information.",60032193,"University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, School of Management",Steyr,Austria,"['1712', '1706']",18.375,0.10378787878787878,0.39458874458874454,1

For large-scale infrastructures, whether commercial or residential, having a reliable evacuation strategy is crucial. Formulation and evaluation of these evacuation strategies is however a daunting challenge. In this paper, we propose a Crowd Simulation and Analysis framework for the formulation and evaluation of effective evacuation strategies in large buildings, using real-scale building structures and agent based approach. We further propose an algorithm to devise an evacuation strategy.

The multi-functional and smart properties of SSW reinforced RPC were investigated in this paper. The research results indicated that the flexural strength, compressive strength and flexural toughness of RPC reinforced with 1.5% SSWs are 31.9%, 41.2% and 114.4% higher than that of RPC without SSW. The electrical resistivity of composites is reduced by six orders of magnitude and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy only shows small flat arcs in the first quadrant. SSW reinforced RPC exhibits stable piezoresistive response under cyclic compressive loading. Meanwhile, the gauge factor of 1.5% SSWs reinforced RPC under monotonic compressive loading can reach 153.9. The addition of 1.5% SSWs leads to 19.9% increase in damping ratio of RPC as well as 202.9% increase for electromagnetic wave shielding efficiency at the frequency of 4 GHz. The electromagnetic wave absorbing property of RPC reinforced with 1.5% SSWs exceeds 125.0% of that of RPC without SSW in the frequency range of 17-18 GHz. The addition of SSW can effectively increase the thermal conductivity and wear resistance of RPC.

Snow plowing is often used to recover roads in the event of heavy snow. Due to the unpredictability of weather conditions, it is difficult to determine the overall performance of a certain truck fleet size, thus make it challenging to estimate the number of snow plow trucks needed for a given highway area. The objective of this research is to estimate the truck fleet performance under uncertain weather conditions, and to provide decision support for selecting a reasonable fleet size. A generic simulation model is developed in the Simphony.NET environment. Weather, road network, and truck speed data are entered as inputs, and Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate random snow events to quantify the performance.

684,684,Learning lightweight lane detection CNNS by self attention distillation,"Training deep models for lane detection is challenging due to the very subtle and sparse supervisory signals inherent in lane annotations. Without learning from much richer context, these models often fail in challenging scenarios, e.g., severe occlusion, ambiguous lanes, and poor lighting conditions. In this paper, we present a novel knowledge distillation approach, i.e., Self Attention Distillation (SAD), which allows a model to learn from itself and gains substantial improvement without any additional supervision or labels. Specifically, we observe that attention maps extracted from a model trained to a reasonable level would encode rich contextual information. The valuable contextual information can be used as a form of 'free' supervision for further representation learning through performing top- down and layer-wise attention distillation within the net- work itself. SAD can be easily incorporated in any feed- forward convolutional neural networks (CNN) and does not increase the inference time. We validate SAD on three popular lane detection benchmarks (TuSimple, CULane and BDD100K) using lightweight models such as ENet, ResNet- 18 and ResNet-34. The lightest model, ENet-SAD, performs comparatively or even surpasses existing algorithms. Notably, ENet-SAD has 20 × fewer parameters and runs 10 × faster compared to the state-of-the-art SCNN, while still achieving compelling performance in all benchmarks.",60120944,SenseTime Group Limited,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707']",22.77777777777778,0.058101851851851856,0.5957175925925926,1

The ultra-high-frequency electrocardiographic (ECG) dyssynchrony (e-DYS) represents a simple ECG derived method that provides information about the ventricular electrical depolarization and thus could become helpful in CRT. The 12-lead ECG (sampling 5kHz/24bits) and echocardiography were obtained in 42 consecutive CRT patients. The e-DYS and standard QRS duration (QRSd) were automatically assessed before, just after, and 6 months after the CRT during CRT Off and CRT On. In 30 CRT responders determined by echocardiography, the e-DYS parameter was significantly lower after 6 months during CRT Off compared to state prior CRT (-9±19ms, p<0.05), while there was no significant e-DYS change during CRT On within 6 months (-1±11ms, NS). A clear shortage of e-DYS was observed just after CRT On (-46±23ms, p<10e-10), and 6 months after CRT On (-46±21ms, p<10e-10) compared to state before CRT. No significant changes of the e-DYS parameter were found in 12 CRT non-responders. The QRSd didn't show any significance in all observed changes.

687,687,What Can Tone and Entropy Tell Us about Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases?,A validated invasive method to calculate cardiovascular risk is using the Framingham cardiovascular risk score. Causes of CVD include atherosclerosis. The level of atherosclerosis is measured by the total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (TC/HDL) ratio. Causes of rhythm disturbance include both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. QT interval dispersion (QTd) indicates ventricular repolarization. The autonomic nervous system can play an essential role in the functional and pathological of the cardiovascular system. Tone and entropy are measures of the mean sympathovagal balance and the total autonomic nervous system activity influencing heart rate. The autonomic nervous system can also provide information on the risk of CVD presence. Tone-entropy analysis indicated that tone is associated to both TC/HDL and QTD length for mild and very high risk group. Entropy was not associated with both TC/HDL and QTD length in any risk categories. Our findings suggest that this may be of use for initial screening for CVD risk as it is noninvasive and easy to perform method.,60104134,Khalifa University of Science and Technology,Abu Dhabi,United Arab Emirates,['1700'],14.727272727272727,0.08277083333333334,0.5653541666666666,1

This study sought to investigate the proarrhythmic effects of N2091S-induced ICaL. Using a dynamic ventricular myocyte model, we simulated ICaL, APs, Ca2+ transients ([Ca2+]i) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium profiles ([Ca2+]SR) in three cell types. Effects of the N2091S mutation on cell electrophysiology were quantified by changes in ICaL density, [Ca2+]i amplitude ([Ca2+]i(max)), SR calcium content ([Ca2+]SR(max)), action potential duration (APD) and AP shape. It was shown that the N2091S mutation increased ICaL(max), [Ca2+]i(max), [Ca2+]SR(max) and APD in three cell types. Compared with ENDO and EPI cells, MCELL cells with excessive prolongation of APD due to the N2091S mutation facilitated inducibility of early afterdepolarization (EAD)-mediated triggered activity. And the different EAD inducibility among the three cell types can amplify the electrical difference and thereby dispersion of repolarization, increasing susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, the N2091S mutation confers not only a trigger, but also a substrate for lethal ventricular arrhythmias.",60021615,Harbin Medical University,Harbin,China,['1700'],22.875,-0.007499999999999998,0.5341666666666666,1

Our alignment procedure is based on pairwise comparisons of 300 consecutive heart beat intervals to the Hexoskin reference interval sequence, using minimization of the overall absolute sum of differences for alignment. Robust linear regression fits were used to adjust for general deviations in the sampling frequencies and for non-linear resampling in a sliding window.Results: Altering sampling frequencies were identified in Faros and Polar devices in the course of experimental measurements in all of 13 subjects.

The algorithm has to deal with imprecise, incorrect and incomplete data in addition to being time aware.Methods: We aimed to build time-specific stacked ensembles and a non-specific XGBoost learner to predict sepsis 6 hours prior to the sepsis onset. The models were trained on a triple split of 40, 336 ICU stays taken from the training sets of the 2019 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge. Data was cleaned and features were built based on rolling windows including several clinical scores and criteria, such as shock index, qSOFA, SOFA, SIRS, NEWS, cNEWS. Model performance was evaluated using task-specific utility functions. Furthermore, variable importance was assessed.Results and conclusion: Although no official score was obtained in the Challenge as team Sepsis2G, we found normalized utility score of 0.394 for our non-specific XG-Boost model on a held out subset of the training data. The threshold selection was displaced in time-specific meta-learners leading to an inferior performance. Most important variables included the assumed presence of ventilation, white blood cell count, partial thromboplastin time, blood urea nitrogen and rolling quantiles of the temperature.

Food rescue programs offer a means of simultaneously diverting surplus food from landfills and addressing food insecurity. Recently, some food rescue organizations in the U.S. have begun leveraging crowd-shipping to more efficiently transport surplus food from donors to food-insecure recipients. However, the success of such initiatives relies on achieving a critical mass of donor and crowd-shipper participation. This paper describes a conceptual agent-based model that was developed to evaluate the design parameters of a volunteer-based crowd-shipping system for food rescue. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the importance of generating sufficient awareness and commitment among potential volunteers in the early stages of the program's development to ensure consistent participation and service.",60004354,Iowa State University,Ames,United States,"['1712', '1706']",19.428571428571427,0.15384615384615388,0.4730769230769231,1

We developed a microsimulation to simulate this movement, as patients are at increased risk for healthcare-associated infections, antibiotic exposure, and other health complications while admitted to healthcare facilities. Patients can also serve as a source of infection throughout the healthcare network as they move locations. This microsimulation is a base model that can be enhanced with various disease-specific agent-based health modules. We calibrated the model to simulate patient movement in North Carolina, where over 1 million hospital admissions occur annually. Each patient originated from a unique starting location and eventually transferred to another healthcare facility or returned home.

707,707,Cardiac Response to Live Music Performance: Computing Techniques for Feature Extraction and Analysis,"Strong emotions and mental stress have been linked to potentially deadly arrhythmias. Music evokes strong emotion through the regulation of tension and release and the modulation of changes and transitions. We exploit this in a novel study involving patients with implanted cardiac defibrillators to study the impact of live music performance on cardiac electrophysiology. The patients' heart rates are artificially fixed with pacing at the higher of 80 beats per minute or 10 above the heart's intrinsic rate. We make continuous recordings directly from the heart muscle whilst the patients are listening to a short classical music concert, which is concurrently recorded in a separate stream. The participants provide annotations of perceived boundaries/transitions and felt tension. The recorded cardiac and music information is further processed to extract relevant features. Here, we describe the experiment design, and the mathematical and computing techniques used to represent and abstract the features from the recorded data. Cardiac reaction is measured by the action potential duration (APD), approximated using the action recovery interval (ARI). The expressive parameters extracted from the music include the time varying loudness, tempo, and harmonic tension.

Bad leads are usually excluded from the inverse problem solution. Alternatively, interpolation can be applied. This study explores how sensitive ECGI is to different bad-lead configurations and interpolation methods. Experimental data from a Langendorff-perfused pig heart suspended in a human-shaped torso-tank was used. Six different bad lead cases were designed based on clinical experience. Inverse problem was solved by applying Tikhonov regularization i) using the complete data, ii) bad-leads-removed data, and iii) interpolated data, with 5 different methods. Our results showed that ECGI accuracy of an interpolation method highly depends on the location of the bad leads. If they are in the high-potential-gradient regions of the torso, a highly accurate interpolation method is needed to achieve an ECGI accuracy close to using complete data. If the BSP reconstruction of the interpolation method is poor in these regions, the reconstructed electro-grams also have lower accuracy, suggesting that bad leads should be removed instead of interpolated. The inverse-forward method was found to be the best among all interpolation methods applied in this study in terms of both missing BSP lead reconstruction and ECGI accuracy, even for the bad leads located over the chest.",60102125,Université de Bordeaux,Bordeaux,France,['1700'],18.545454545454547,-0.12578947368421048,0.5582456140350878,1

Here we propose an update of our recent Paci2018 hiPSC-CM model, focusing particularly on the mechanisms underlying the action potential (AP) automaticity, i.e. one of the clearest markers of hiPSC-CM immaturity. We used two recently published formulations of the fast Na+ (INa) and the funny (If) currents to improve our previous fitting of in vitro experiments. We then used an optimization framework to automatically identify the parameters formalizing currents/mechanisms for which in vitro data were not available. We identified a model producing APs and Ca2+ transients (CaTrs) in agreement with literature and our in-house CaTr data. We showed that a strong (90%) Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (INCX) block suppresses the spontaneous APs, in agreement with in vitro data. The new Paci2019 was further validated against the in vitro experiments used for the Paci2018 model, showing that this update did not affect the capability of the new model to simulate mechanisms (e.g. responses to drugs or proarrhythmic events) successfully reproduced by the previous model. In conclusion, the Paci2019 model represents an improved tools for in silico studies e.g. on hiPSC-CM responses to drugs.",60028218,Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna,Bologna,Italy,['1700'],19.09090909090909,0.16196969696969696,0.5179545454545454,1

In this paper we discuss the combination of static capacity and dynamic simulation approaches for production planning, highlighting how these approaches complement each other in our daily business process. The typical static capacity planning is based on a fixed product lead time, allocating the production volume of each product to available capacity with an objective of capacity minimization and a constraint of utilization limit (plan load limit) to absorb production variability. Whereas the dynamic simulation models the process of lots flowing through the production line, and consume the capacity at each process steps, with additional consideration of fab WIP at the beginning of simulation.

The Inverse Dower Transform, used to obtain the vectorcardiograms is based on a very simplistic torso conductor model, and hence not optimized. The present study aims to optimize the transform to maximize classifier accuracy. A parametric optimization model was proposed, as well as an optimization scheme. Model parameters were obtained by iteratively optimizing the linear SVM classifier accuracy until convergence. The goal can be shown to be multimodal and non-smooth. Therefore, a multi-instance and derivative-free method was considered. Previous dataset of 56 flutter recordings (31 right, 25 left) was used, considering only non-overlapped and respiratory motion-corrected F loops. For the SVM classifier, a 3.8% increase in accuracy was observed (max 0.95). When the logistic regression classifier was used, an increase of 7.8% was observed (max 0.98).

Plans are developed to structure production in end-to-end supply chains that can experience nervousness due to uncertainties that results in unsatisfied customers. Although the external causes of nervousness and instabilities in supply chain planning systems were previously considered in the literature, internal nervousness of planning these complex networks can result from how the sub-components of the planning system interact. To study internal nervousness, a supply chain system of a semiconductor manufacturer is investigated as a case study.

In this paper, we develop mixed integer linear programs for linear, affine, exit recursion, and flow line models of CPTs to optimize schedules with respect to mean cycle time, makespan, and tardiness. We simulate a true CPT using a flow line and solve the MILPs for other above mentioned, reduced models.

Complex cyber-physical systems play a very important role within this development. Hence, integrated model-based design of such systems has gained significant attention. Quite naturally, this leads to the necessity of modeling hybrid system - systems containing both continuous-time and event-based phenomena. Hybrid modeling languages based on equations, supporting both continuous-time and eventbased aspects (e.g. Modelica, SysML, VHDL-AMS, and Simulink/Simscape) enable high-level reuse and integrated modeling capabilities of both the physically surrounding system and software for embedded systems. Using such equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages, it has become feasible to model complex systems covering multiple application domains at a high level of abstraction through reusable model components. They thus offer considerable advantages for many application areas.

The perturbation enters as a fictitious visco-plastic eigen-strain rate and is derived from the elastic inclusion problem. As a consequence, the numerical efficiency of the VPSC model (Lebensohn and Tomé 1993 Acta Metall. Mater. 41 2611-2624) is retained, with the added capability of predicting both, elastic and visco-plastic strain components in the grains. The proposed model (VPSC+) is validated by comparing with the self-consistent crystal plasticity model of Lebensohn and Tomé (VPSC) (Lebensohn and Tomé 1993 Acta Metall. Mater. 41 2611-2624), the elastic-rigid-plastic model (EPSC) of Turner and Tomé (1994 Acta Metall. Mater. 42 4143-4153), and the elasto-visco-plastic model (EVPSC) developed by Wang et al (2010 J.

The prediction of texture evolution, stress-strain response, strain rate sensitivity, and internal elastic strain evolution were consistent with those of the other models, in simulations of 316 L stainless steel and Mg AZ31 alloy. VPSC+ showed a superior numerical stability and computational speed when compared to EVPSC, and convergence was successfully achieved with relatively large increments.

726,726,Sleep Stage Influence on the Autonomic Modulation of Sleep Apnea Syndrome,"Hypoxia induced by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) leads to the deregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), resulting in an abnormally increased sympathetic activity. Since ANS modulation varies throughout the night, notably for each sleep stage, the hypno-gram and heart rate signals of 81 OSA patients were collected during a polysomnography. They were classified as mild-moderate (n=44) or severe (n=37) based on their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Spectral heart rate variability (HRV) series were extracted by a time-frequency approach. These series were then averaged for each sleep stage, in order to compare the sympathetic modulation of mild-moderate and severe patients at the following phases: rapid eye movement (REM), S1, S2 and SWS (slow wave sleep). According to normalized power at the low-frequency band (LFnu) values, severe OSA seems to be associated with an increased sympathetic modulation at non-REM sleep. Moreover, a decreased autonomic variability throughout the night may be related to a reduced adaptability of the cardiovascular system, characterizing a more advanced stage of the disease. These results provide further evidence for the role of autonomic alterations induced by hypoxia, suggesting the use of HRV analysis, together with AHI, for the study of OSA severity.",60007592,Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya,Barcelona,Spain,['1700'],24.25,0.19999999999999998,0.6090909090909091,1

By contrast, dynamic bottleneck methods both identify elements that yield the largest gain in productivity with increased availability and also visualize these elements over time to enable bottlenecks to be better understood. In this paper we discuss whether dynamic bottleneck detection methods can be utilized to identify, measure, and visualize causes of observed behavior in complex models.

For pricing an Asian option under an ordinary geometric Brownian motion model, for example, Array-RQMC can reduce the variance by factors in the millions. In this paper, we show how to apply this method and we study its effectiveness in case the underlying process has stochastic volatility. We show that Array-RQMC can also work very well for these models, even if it requires RQMC points in larger dimension. We examine in particular the variance-gamma, Heston, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic volatility models, and we provide numerical results.",60009507,University of Montreal,Montreal,Canada,"['1712', '1706']",22.0,0.1610952380952381,0.4561904761904761,1
732,732,The Ionic Mechanisms of Triggered Atrial Activity under a TBX5-driven Regulatory Network,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in clinical practice, yet the pathophysiology by which genetic factors can increase the risk of AF is not well understood. Recently, a multitiered transcriptional network, driven by a T-box transcription factor gene TBX5 and a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 gene PITX2 was discovered. This transcriptional network regulates gene expressions associated with ion channels in a complex fashion, and through mice knockout studies, it was found that reducing the expression of TBX5 altered the gene expressions of certain types of ion channels and generated abnormal depolarizations in the form of early afterdepolarizations, delayed afterdepolarizations, or spontaneous triggered action potentials. To systematically investigate the ionic mechanisms by which impaired TBX5 can lead to AF, we integrated the calcium dynamics of the Grandi et al. model into the Courtemanche-Ramirez-Nattel model. Our model reproduced all forms of abnormal depolarizations observed in TBX5 knockout atrial myocytes. Furthermore, we discovered that the remodeling of the inward-rectifier potassium channel (IK1) and the L- type calcium channel (ICaL), due to impaired TBX5, causes an elevation in the concentration of calcium ([Ca2+]), which reactivates the sodium-calcium exchanger (INaCa) and ICaL to generate abnormal depolarizations.",60112777,"Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland",Auckland,New Zealand,['1700'],27.714285714285715,0.1361607142857143,0.4245535714285714,1

Advanced sensor technology and wireless communication is used to maintain short and safe following distances between the trucks. This paper proposes an agent-based simulation model to evaluate a matchmaking system for trucks to find a suitable partner to platoon with. We consider two types of platoon matching: real-time (at a truck stop) and opportunistic (while driving on the highway). We evaluate the proposed system using a case study at the Port of Rotterdam and the surrounding area, where we study various factors influencing platoon formation and profitability. Results show that the most influential factors in both platoon formation and the total platoon profitability are wage savings and the possibility of different truck brands to platoon together.",60020599,University of Twente,Enschede,Netherlands,"['1712', '1706']",22.666666666666668,0.195,0.45999999999999996,1

The classification accuracy can be improved by reducing the label noises which can be achieved by observing multiple independent observations of the labels. Hence, an efficient budget allocation strategy is needed to reduce the label noise and meanwhile guarantees a promising classification accuracy. Two problem settings are investigated in this work. One assumes that we do not know the underlying classification structures and labels can only be determined by comparing the sample average of its Bernoulli success probability with a given threshold. The other case assumes that data points with different labels can be separated by a hyperplane. For both cases, the closed-form optimal budget allocation strategies are developed. A simulation analytics example is used to demonstrate how the budget is allocated to different scenarios to further improve the learning of optimal decision functions.",60018540,Southwestern University of Finance and Economics,Chengdu,China,"['1712', '1706']",18.625,0.02954545454545454,0.4,1

The frequency response of the machine was carefully checked. Peak to peak QRS amplitudes of average beats of the 10 second recordings were measured in all 8 independent leads with the results obtained at the full bandwidth of the ECG machine regarded as the reference.The full bandwidth of the 8500 was verified as 0.05 - 540Hz.

Furthermore, research has suggested that vectorcardiography has superior diagnostic abilities compared to the standard electrocardiogram in myocardial infarction. This study aimed to assess the ability of vectorcardiographic ventricular depolarization and repolarization to classify myocardial infarction patients versus control subjects. 147 vectorcardiogram recordings (78 MI vs. 69 Control) were obtained from the PTB database. For each recording, 60 QRS-complex and T-wave VCG beats were extracted using the Two-Dimensional Signal Warping algorithm. An inhomogeneous three-dimensional template adaptation scheme was applied on each QRS-loop and T-loop to capture subtle morphological changes from beat-to-beat. Training was performed on a regularized three-layer long short-term memory network. The classifier produced test set classification results with an overall 89.1% accuracy, 89.1% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity.

Focus group interview and in-depth expert interview were conducted. The results indicated that the participants had high acceptance of importing service robot into catering service. They feel the service robots are somewhat novel and attractively. From the perspective of task orientation, the participants think that the service robots could be introduced to all of the catering service process in the future. However, they also hoped that the human and robots can cooperate and work together in the processes. They hope to have more interaction with robots. They are delight to see the service robot can bring customers different feelings and experience. They don't want to face a standard and ice-cold robot. The participants hope that the service robots have a wide variety of external appearance to meet the style of restaurants. They also anticipate the robot can act various body movements and facial expression. Immediate assistance to customers and service workers are expected. Incorrect message transmission can be tolerant by the customers, however, exact communication with service personnel is considered to be very important. The service workers have willing to work together with service robots and hope the highrisk and heavy work can be done by service robots to reduce accidents and improve the reliability and safety. The feeling of safety and more affect feeling is needed for the customers. Besides, the participants are more concerned about the value that service robots can generate. Cost down of human resources and reduced workload was expected especially. Application of service robots does not necessarily imply that manual and cognitive tasks will be replaced by machines. It is essential to serve and observe the emotional needs of customers and service workers. Highskilled workers may become more productive as they become coworkers of machines and both complement each other even at the same level of value creation. Therefore, thinking about how to cooperate and work together for the workers and service robot while introducing service robot into catering service is an important topic.

To do this research, the ECG signal was recorded from the volunteers during four stages, and HRV signal were obtained. Then 12 features, including time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear analysis, were extracted for each volunteer. By calculating P-value for each interference stage compared to the resting stage, we extracted four various features from HRV that changed during the interference. The P-values of these features were below 0.065.These 4 significant features of HRV were as follows: 1) LF: low frequency of HRV signal. 2) RMSSD: the root-mean square difference of successive R-R intervals. 3) SDNN: a standard deviation of the NN intervals, which is the square root of their variance. 4) SD1: one of the indices obtained from Poincaré plot.According to the result, RMSSD, SDNN, and SD1 were significantly decreased and LF was significantly increased during the test. The results showed that the ANS (autonomic nervous system) activity in volunteers was changed during the test.

Games with individual players are the subject of over 20 published investigations. Moreover, there are many popular commercial anagram games such as Scrabble. Recently, cooperative team play of anagram games has been studied experimentally. With all of the experimental work and the popularity of such games, it is somewhat surprising that very little modeling of anagram games has been done to predict player behavior/actions in them. We devise a cooperative group anagram game and develop an agent-based modeling and simulation framework to capture player interactions of sharing letters and forming words. Our primary goals are to understand, quantitatively predict, and explain individual and aggregate group behavior, through simulations, to inform the design of a group anagram game experimental platform.",60027090,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,Blacksburg,United States,"['1712', '1706']",20.0,0.07585784313725492,0.4372549019607844,1

Here, we introduce a computational framework for personalized simulations of ventricular electrophysiology (EP) incorporating scar. This framework was utilized in a patient who had ventricular fibrillation (VF).From delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) an anatomical model was constructed. Regions of scar and border zone were segmented by thresholding. EP was then simulated using CARPentry. The Ten Tusscher ventricular EP model was adapted locally to reflect healthy, border zone or scar tissue. In this patient, three distinct premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) were identified using electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI), one of which induced VF. The clinically observed PVCs were replicated in the virtual model to study arrhythmia development, but VF could not be reproduced with a simple stimulation protocol that disregarded patient-specific conditions present at the time of actual VF induction. This could indicate that not only the virtual heart model, but also the stress test may need to be personalized for accurate arrhythmia simulations.In conclusion, this computational framework enables EP simulations based on MRI-detected scar, and allows to study the amount of personalization required.",60070744,Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht,Maastricht,Netherlands,['1700'],20.444444444444443,0.12000000000000002,0.38904761904761903,1

Armband-ECG and conventional-Holter-ECG signals were simultaneously recorded from 14 subjects during 5 minutes in supine position. Spacial principal component analysis was used to obtain a unique armband ECG signal in which the electromyogram contribution is attenuated. QRS complexes were automatically detected. Five traditional HRV parameters were derived: SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, and powers within low frequency (LF, [0.04, 0.15] Hz) and high frequency (HF, [0.15, 0.4] Hz) bands. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the measurements from the armband device and the measures from the Holter device was computed.

As part of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019, we developed an ensemble-based approach for the early detection of sepsis in ICU patients.Our final model predicted sepsis using the previous 24 hours of data, and consisted of a combination of two con-volutional neural networks and a random forest trained on different subsets of the data. In training our models, we experimented with random undersampling and cluster-based undersampling as a means for addressing severe class imbalance. On validation data, our final model achieved a utility score of 0.432 on hospital A (AUROC: 0.794, AUPRC: 0.101), 0.247 on hospital B (AUROC: 0.816, AUPRC: 0.056), and a utility of 0.375 on combined data from both hospitals (AUROC: 0.809, AUPRC: 0.089).

This work provides a simulation-based optimization tool to support decision makers in tackling this challenging problem. The proposed framework relies on an optimization engine for the generation of the daily plans. A simulation component is used to evaluate the applicability of such plans by taking into account the stochastic factors.

Global fab scheduling steers scheduling decisions at work-center level by providing objective in terms of production targets, i.e. product quantities to complete for each operation and at each period on a scheduling horizon. A WIP balancing strategy is proposed to minimize the product mix variability in terms of throughput and cycle time. This strategy is enforced using a global scheduling optimization model which is formulated as a linear programming model. The global scheduling model is coupled with a generic multi-method simulation model for evaluation purpose.

In this paper, we present two methods for early prediction of sepsis from clinical data. One is neural network-based method and the other is eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) based method. Considering the temporal relationship between clinical data from sepsis patients in the ICU, we built a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to extract the intrinsic relation between different indicators in clinical data and meanwhile model the temporal dependencies, which only uses the previous information not future information to predict the results. Neural networks have made great achievements in unstructured data, such as image processing and speech processing, while traditional machine learning methods are better at processing structured data than neural networks. Thus, we trained an XGBoost model on the pre-processed data for improving the prediction accuracy. In official phase, we only used the first seven vital signs in our network, on test set A, the LSTM-based method has the utility score is 0.267 and the score of XGBoost-based method is 0.392.

However, the direct measurement of Pa is invasive and expensive. In the paper, a new simplified Kalman filter (SKF) algorithm for blind system identification was employed for the reconstruction of Pa waveforms using two peripheral artery pressure waveforms. The data of Pa waveforms are collected from 24 human subjects. Simultaneously, brachial artery and femoral artery pressure waveforms data are generated from the simulation of a known two-channel finite impulse response system. In order to study the performance of the proposed SKF algorithm, different amounts of signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal were used in the experiment.

Previous biological studies suggested that Na+-Ca2+ exchange current (INaCa) -related gene increased 4-fold in pacemaker cells than normal cardiac myocytes. In addition, the accumulation of intracellular Na+ was observed due to the combination of If and prompting feedback mechanism of Na+/K+ pumping may accelerate pumping out excessive Na+ in pacemaker cells. In this study, we construct a pacemaker model based on a ventricular myocyte model by manipulating IK1 and If and optimize this pacemaker model by augmenting INaCa and INaK. Simulating results showed that overexpressing INaCa and INaK balanced the equilibrium of intracellular ionic concentrations effectively and enhanced the pacemaking ability.

U-patterns take place in the RR-interval time series during sleep. As their name suggests, these patterns present a U-shaped decrease-increase in RR-intervals, with a duration lasting from 20 to 40 seconds together with a minimum decrease of 15% in the local RR mean value.Over a span of 17 days, 15 healthy subjects (7males, 22.1 ± 1.7 yrs.) participated in a study of three subsequent stages. First, a baseline phase of seven days, during which the subjects slept normally. Immediately after, a sleep deprivation phase with a duration of three days, during which participants slept only three hours per night. Finally, in a 7-day recovery phase subjects went back to their normal baseline sleeping routine. Subjects underwent polysomnography (PSG) data acquisition while sleeping. U-patterns were extracted from RR-intervals while movement events were extracted from different PSG channels. Their relative temporal layout was studied to determine whether U-patterns are caused due to subject movement during sleep or vice versa. Results show that U-pattern/movement events are correlated, always initiated by U-patterns with movement events terminating before the termination of their respective U-patterns.",60028186,Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Lausanne,Switzerland,['1700'],20.7,0.024768518518518523,0.4043981481481481,1

Agent-based modeling, on the other hand, can efficiently handle such randomness resulting from the interactions among different members or elements of a systems.

768,768,On indistinguishability and antisymmetry properties in multiple target tracking,"The notion of indistinguishable targets is well established in advanced target tracking. If no specific target attributes are sensed, indistinguishability is often unavoidable and sometimes even desirable, for example, to enable “privacy by design” in public surveillance. Conceptually, this notion is rooted in quantum physics where functions of joint quantum particle states are considered that are either symmetric or antisymmetric under permutation of the particle labels. This symmetry dichotomy explains why quite fundamentally two disjunct classes of particles exist in nature: bosons and fermions. Besides symmetry, also antisymmetry has a place in multiple target tracking as we will show, leading to well-defined probability density functions describing the joint target states. Inbuilt antisymmetry implies a target tracking version of Pauli’s exclusion principle: Real-world targets are “fermions” in the sense that cannot exist at the same time in the same state. This is of interest in dense tracking scenarios with resolution conflicts and split-off and may mitigate track coalescence phenomena, for example.

Dominant frequency (DF) and reentrant activity analysis were calculated for each scenario. Anatomical and geometrical measurements of each torso (30-80% of variability between patients) and atria were calculated and compared with the errors in the ECGI estimation versus the departing EGM maps.Results show evidences that big chest dimensions worsen the non-invasive calculation of AF markers (p<0.05). Also, higher number of visible electrodes from each atrial region improves ECGI characterization measured as lower DF deviations (0.64±0.26 Hz vs 0.72±0.27 Hz, p<0.05) and higher reentrant activity coincidence (10.1±12.2% vs 3.4±3.4%, p<0.05).Torso and atrial geometry affect the quality of the non-invasive reconstruction of AF markers such as DF or reentrant activity.

Automated cardiovascular auscultation of the abdomen in both infrasonic and audible frequencies is a non-invasive method for monitoring the maternal and fetal health, including blood flow to the placenta. However, the quality of such recordings is often compromised by artifacts. The purpose of this study was to automatically identify high-quality auscultation signals. 324 recordings were obtained with two microphones placed bilaterally on the abdomen of 90 pregnant women (gestational age of 28-41 weeks), with signal duration of 30 s - 180 s.

In this situation, the obtained solutions are subject to statistical noises that affect both the feasibility and the objective performance. To guarantee feasibility, common approaches in data-driven optimization impose constraint reformulations that are safe enough to ensure solution feasibility with high confidence. Often times, selecting this safety margin relies on loose statistical estimates, in turn leading to overly conservative and suboptimal solutions. We propose a validation-based framework to balance the feasibility-optimality tradeoff more efficiently, by leveraging the typical low-dimensional structure of solution paths in these data-driven reformulations instead of estimates based on the whole decision space utilized by past approaches.

784,784,Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Framework for Fetal ECG Signal Denoising,"Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography has the potential of providing vital information for evaluating the health status of the fetus. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of the fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) impedes the applicability of the method in clinical practice. Residual noise in the fetal ECG, after the maternal ECG is suppressed, is often non-stationary, complex and has spectral overlap with the fetal ECG. We present a deep fully convolutional encoder-decoder framework, for removing the residual noise from single-channel fetal ECG. The method was tested in a broad simulated fetal ECG dataset with varying amount of noise. The results demonstrate that after the denoising there was an average increase in the correlation coefficient between the corrupted signals and the original ones from 0.6 to 0.8. Moreover, the suggested framework successfully handled different levels of noises in a single model. The network was further tested on real signals showing substantial noise removal performance, thus providing a promising approach for fetal ECG signal denoising. The presented method is able to significantly improve the quality of the extracted fetal ECG signals, having the advantage of preserving beat-to-beat morphological variations.",60032882,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Eindhoven,Netherlands,['1700'],20.333333333333332,0.12006302521008404,0.5015756302521008,1

We evaluated the accuracy of wrist-worn optical heart rate monitor in beat-to-beat interval estimation and performance in classifying the rhythm in sinus or atrial fibrillation with 30 post cardiac surgery patients (69.3 ± 6.9 years) in 24-hour recordings. The recordings were made during the first post-operative days when the patients are still relatively stationary and are in high risk of getting post-surgery atrial fibrillationThe results show 10.04 ms mean absolute error in beat-to-beat intervals. Atrial fibrillation was analysed in 5-minute segments. 100% sensitivity and 96.1% specificity were obtained. The specificity was increased to 99.74% when the data segments with large number of ventricular and supra ventricular extra systoles were removed.

786,786,Noninvasive One-Year Ablation Outcome Prediction for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Using Trajectories of Activation from Body Surface Potential Maps,"Almost 40% of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) patients experience arrhythmia recurrence within a year after initial ablation success. The rich spatiotemporal information provided by body surface potential maps (BSPMs) can reveal AF dynamics. We hypothesised that the dipole direction of the heart during AF can be traced by the centroid trajectory of the principal ""activated"" electrode patch from the BSPM, where an electrode is defined as ""activated"" when its signal exhibits a local peak. This hypothesis was first verified using simulated and patient data, indicating that the trajectory has a high correlation with atrial electrical activity. The trajectory was then used as a spatiotemporal feature to predict one-year AF recurrence (22 negative and 23 positive) after ablation among 45 paroxysmal AF patients. The trajectories were segmented according to AF cycles for prediction in a multiple instance classification framework, using a Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) and a linear support vector machine (SVM) with L1 penalty for classification. A leave-one-out test showed 0.73 accuracy, 0.70 sensitivity and 0.77 specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) as 0.84. The work suggests that with the proposed trajectory extracted from the BSPM, the prediction for paroxysmal AF ablation follow-up could be improved.",60102125,Université de Bordeaux,Bordeaux,France,['1700'],25.5,0.08596418732782368,0.3668595041322314,1

More than 15,000 debris have been recorded, and this represents a danger for current and future missions to space. A solution is to remove these spacecrafts from orbit. One way to do it is to use inflatable devices. During the descent in the atmosphere, the landing vehicle and its braking device are subjects to important perturbations, due to external environment. Thus, the inflatable device can be deformed, due to its flexibility, and the movement can become unstable. The purpose of this paper is to determine which angle of axis deviation during the landing is the safest for the transportation system. To do so, created a program that, for given initial conditions, and depending on the axis deviation and the type of ground during the landing of the transportation system, calculates the overload sustained. Then studied 14 different cases: 7 different axis deviation for two ground types (soft and hard), and extrapolated the results. These results showed that the safest landing is when the transportation system lands perpendicular to the ground, and the most dangerous one is when the axis deviation is the highest, resulting in bounces of the system. Can then conclude that the lower the axis deviation is, the safest the landing is.",60103671,Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology,Paris,France,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",19.818181818181817,0.050555555555555576,0.48444444444444446,1

This operation typically involves taking images and / or registering some key performance indicators. Whenever this surveillance action is repetitive, a natural goal to achieve is to complete each cycle of visits as fast as possible, so that the number of times each target zone is visited during a time interval is maximized. Since many factors might influence travel times, they are modeled as random variables. Reliability issues are also considered, since random travel times might prevent a route from being successfully completed before the UAV runs out of battery.

In this research, a new approach for detection and quantification of four emotions (pleasure, sadness, anger, and joy) is introduced based on the 2D regression models of emotions. ECG signal of 70 healthy female volunteers was recorded while the participants were stimulated by four different colors for five minutes.

The results confirm the findings of previous studies that showed that each color is related to one emotion. The mean square error for estimation of arousal and valence levels were 0.0393 and 0.0536, respectively. In emotion classification, sensitivity of 96.78%, specificity of 99.4%, and the accuracy of98.75% were achieved.

Statistical shape modeling tools used to represent (i.e., parameterize) the underlying LAA variability are of crucial importance to learn shape-based predictors of stroke. Most shape modeling techniques use some form of alignment either as a data pre-processing step or during the modeling step. However, the LAA is a joint anatomy along with left atrium (LA), and the relative position and alignment plays a crucial part in determining risk of stroke. In this paper, we explore different alignment strategies for statistical shape modeling and how each strategy affects the stroke prediction capability. This allows for identifying a unified approach of alignment while analyzing the LAA anatomy for stroke. Here, we study three different alignment strategies, (i) global alignment, (ii) global translational alignment and (iii) cluster based alignment. Our results show that alignment strategies that take into account LAA orientation, i.e., (ii), or the inherent natural clustering of the population under study, i.e., (iii), provide significant improvement over global alignment in both qualitative as well as quantitative measures.",60025488,The University of Utah,Salt Lake City,United States,['1700'],23.75,0.09821428571428571,0.3910714285714286,1

This task, however, is not trivial when the inflow and outflow tract must be taken into account. These tracts are a difficulty for reconstructing whole cardiac shapes from CMR. We aimed to develop a method to reconstruct either left cardiac structure or right cardiac structure with minimal user assistance in a unified geometric framework. Ventricular, atrial, and arteries contours were delineated on short axis images. Cyclic dynamic time wrapping (DTW) method were utilized to triangulate two parallel contours on neighboring imaging slices. Reconstructing three contours on inflow and outflow tracts were divided into two parts. The outer part was reconstructed from the lower contour and the convex hull of two upper contours. The interior part was parobolic surfaces fit to points not existing in the convex hull and the Voronoi cell centroids. All cases were automatically reconstructed successfully with average computational time less than one minute. Reconstructed shape have anatomically reasonable structures.",60008332,Nanchang University,Nanchang,China,['1700'],15.454545454545455,0.07709750566893424,0.28185941043083895,1

Emphasizing the integration of discrete event and continuous modeling approaches, iterative systems specification provides a sound system-theoretic basis for quantized system and distributed co-simulation supporting the co-existence of multiple formalisms in model components.

The overly simplified and generalized assumption of navigation behaviors does not highlight the need of capturing individual differences in spatial cognition and navigation decision-making, or the impacts of diverse ways of spatial information display. This study proposes the visual attention patterns in floorplan review to be a stronger predictor of human navigation behaviors. To set the theoretical foundation, a Virtual Reality (VR) experiment was performed to test if visual attention patterns during spatial information review can predict the quality of spatial memory, and how the relationship is affected by the diverse ways of information display, including 2D, 3D and VR.

Ablation procedures were guided by Carto®3 voltage maps and CardioInsight™ rotors maps. The location of rotors was qualitatively compared with low-voltage areas (<0.5 mV). In addition, frequency analysis was carried out with five bipolar EGMs, recorded by using a decapolar catheter located in the coronary sinus. Spectral analysis was performed using the Welch method. The highest peak in the spectrum was defined as the dominant frequency (DF). To measure the periodicity and organization of the signals, the regularity (IR) and organization (IO) indexes were implemented.Our results showed that rotors location largely corresponded to low-voltage zones (85.7%).

We have selected features based on the observation that patient vitals are available on an hourly basis, whereas lab results if available are less frequent. To capture the time series nature of the data, we trained the model using long short term memory (LSTM), a version of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. To capture locale specific pathology baseline, we have engineered features using two methods. We define a minimum maximum value for vitals and lab tests and normalize the incoming data against this min-max value. Secondly, to leverage sparsely available lab data that signal increased sepsis risk, we define a synthetic ""risk"" feature. This risk feature is assigned a higher score when certain lab values are available and exceed a threshold.

821,821,The Influence of Using a Static Diastolic Geometry in ECG Imaging,"One of the common choices when performing electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) is that the cardiac geometry is in a static, diastolic state. To test the influence of this approximation, we compared epicardial potential maps and isochrones during systolic and diastolic geometries in four patients. Zero-th order Tikhonov regularization was used to reconstruct ventricular epicardial potentials. A spatiotemporal estimation method was then used to determine the activation and recovery times from the reconstructed epicardial electrograms. Activation times (AT), recovery times (RT) and electrogram correlation coefficients (CC) were compared for both geometries. Furthermore, CC and differences in AT/ RT were correlated against the linear movement and a substitute for rotational movement. Poor correlation was found between linear/rotational movement and reconstruction differences. Overall, agreement between epicardial potential maps and isochrones of both geometries was high when assessed quantitatively, but regional differences might occur for qualitative interpretation. These differences mostly occurred in areas of flat T-waves.

In addition to standard heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, we extracted beat-to-beat QT interval variability (QTV) parameters from consecutive epochs of 5 minutes by employing two-dimensional signal warping. We used a general linear mixed model (GLMM) to investigate the relationship between extracted parameters and sex under consideration of clinical and sleep characteristics. The GLMM shows a significant differences (P < 0.001) of sex on QTV, T wave amplitude and standard HRV parameters. In addition, the GLMM shows significant effects of sleep stages and age. While standard deviation of QT intervals is significantly higher in females than males (P < 0.001), T wave amplitude is about 30 % lower (P < 0.001) in females than in males. Applying T wave amplitude correction to QTV to minimize within-group variability and removed sex-related differences (P = 0.581). A demonstrated difference in uncorrected QTV is is likely due to lower T wave amplitudes in females. By applying a correction formula, we can account for T amplitude differences.

In addition, approximately 1 in 1000 fetuses experience oxygen deprivation during labor which is severe enough to cause brain injury. It is estimated that half of these cases of birth-related injury are preventable. Incorrect cardiotocography (CTG) interpretation is leading the list of causes.Intrapartum CTG is used routinely to measure maternal uterine pressure and fetal heart rate (FHR). Antepartum CTG monitoring is used to identify fetuses at risk of intrauterine hypoxia and acidaemia. As early as 28 weeks of gestation, analysis of the FHR trace is used as a nonstress test to assess the fetal well-being. In the perinatal period, timely, appropriate intervention can avoid fetal neurological damage or death. The CTG is visually assessed by a clinician or interpreted by computer analysis. In the context of labor monitoring, the CTG is used for continuous fetal monitoring. An abnormal heart rate will lead the clinician to perform a cesarean.With the recent advances in machine learning and statistical signal analysis new algorithms for assessing fetal antepartum or intrapartum health status are being elaborated.

Annotating a large ECG database may not be feasible, hence, the interest in developing an evaluation tool that does not require reference annotation. We developed a tool for evaluating key performance attributes (KPA) including arrhythmia detection, heart rate, ST value, and noise tolerance. The tool has three layers of KPA graphics. The top layer includes interactive distribution graphs of the KPA values for aggregated results for the entire database. From this top layer the user can select an individual record to launch interactive trending graphs that display the KPA values, or their discrepancies, for a time span on that particular record. From this second layer the user can identify any KPA value of interest (e.g., a specific arrhythmia label) to view the underlying ECG waveform. Navigating through these three layers, the user is able to quickly confirm the validity of KPA reported by the algorithm. We modified the noise tolerance of an exercise ECG arrhythmia algorithm.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how the coexistence of myocardial infarction and ischemia alters excitation wave propagation.Methods: The electrophysiology remodeling under ischemia condition was mimicked based on experimental data and incorporated into TP06 model. Using the constructed 2D and 3D models, we simulated the excitation wave conduction in ventricular tissue under five different conditions: normal, myocardial ischemia under three levels, and myocardial infarction conditions.Results: Simulation results showed that the conduction velocity and rotor tracks are different in the normal, infarcted and ischemic conditions.

Incidents can be reduced through mitigation in the planning phase. To reduce safety incidents, proper quantification of risk impact is necessary throughout the project. Incorporating continuously occurring safety risks within a project network schedule represented by discrete activities remains challenging. This paper proposes a methodology for building a combined discrete-event continuous simulation model to predict safety-incident related schedule delays. An algorithm uses project information stored in a database to automatically construct a Critical Path Method (CPM) network in Simphony.NET. The model simulates daily risk occurrence using a discrete-event process to model reduced project productivity.

For this purpose, we first present existing approaches in this field, we then analyze them, and we present trends in the field of automatic composition of structures for simulation models. Subsequently, possibilities from the field of software engineering are discussed, illustrating a possible approach to the composition of structures for simulation models. In particular, the focus is placed on synthesis of logical structures by means of combinatory logic. The strategy of how this logic can support the automated generation of structural variants in simulation models is shown on the basis of one of the areas of intralogistics. In our example, different possibilities of structural variants are clarified and their potential for automated composition demonstrated.",60032991,TU Dortmund University,Dortmund,Germany,"['1712', '1706']",21.833333333333332,0.07407407407407407,0.39629629629629626,1
837,837,Bus Fleet Size Dimensioning in an International Airport Using Discrete Event Simulation,"The continuous growth of airport operations generates continuous infrastructure expansion needs at international airports. In some cases, in the face of limitations in short-term expansions, the immediate solution is the creation of remote positions that allow a greater number of flights to be attended but which require the use of bus fleets to attend passenger boarding and disembarking operations. The sizing of the buses will allow to reduce the waiting times of flights below the level of service required by international standards. For this purpose, the development of a discrete event simulation model integrated to the transactional flight database is proposed. In the literature, although many references to simulation models have been found in airports, they have not been specifically focused in order to size and manage the bus fleet. Simulation experiments of this model under the management of scenarios allows to identify the bus fleet size required.",60102124,Université Fédérale Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées,Toulouse,France,"['1712', '1706']",24.666666666666668,0.18,0.24,1
838,838,Effect of Postural Changes on Complexity Measures of Heart Rhythm in Late Adolescents,"Even trivial changing of body position from supine to sitting triggers complex cardiovascular adaptive response to prevent brain ischemiaThe study was performed to investigate heart rate asymmetry (HRA) and entropy-based heart rate variability (HRV) in stationary conditions in two body positions. Forty male students, aged 18-20 participated in this study. High resolution (4 kHz) ECG was recorded for 15 minutes; first in supine and after that in sitting position. 512 beat-to-beat interval (RRi) time-series were selected from each recording. Entropy-based parameters such as sample entropy (SampEn) and approximate entropy (ApEn) were computed. Heart cycles shorter (acceleration) or longer (deceleration) from the previous ones and sequential monotonic changes of RRi were also discriminated. Number of HR sequential runs significantly correlated with SampEn and ApEn both in sitting and supine position. Postural change from supine to sitting position resulted in a significant HR increase from 69 to 77 bpm. Both SampEn and ApEn were decreased after changing position (from 1.54 to 1.20 and from 1.23 to 1.08, respectively)Our data obtained from nonlinear HRV analysis indicate a reduction of cardiac control complexity following postural upright changing of body position.",60012383,Gdanski Uniwersytet Medyczny,Gdańsk,Poland,['1700'],20.666666666666668,-0.019743589743589744,0.43,1

This paper, while employing discrete event simulation, uses Simpony.NET tool to model the process of transporting modules and assembling them on the construction site of a future multi-residential project. By adding more details, such as the weather and traffic conditions, the simulation results can become more accurate. In addition, as most simulation models for modular construction processes focus mainly on the assembly of modules on site, this paper also quantified the weather influence in terms of project duration and manpower utilization.

840,840,A Distributed Agent-Based Framework for a Constellation of Drones in a Military Operation,"A seamless communication capability is important in military operations. Likewise, enhanced security, increased capacity, and robust communication mechanisms are vital for humanitarian and disaster-response operations. Often, a system of wide-band satellites is employed for real-time exchange of information and over-the-horizon control, but the communications are prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks, and delayed redeployment. Hence, a swarm of drones could be deployed in mission-critical operations in times of urgency for a secured and robust distributed-intercommunication which is essential for survivability and successful completion of missions. In this paper, a distributed-agent-based framework for secure and reliable information exchange between drones in a constellation is proposed. The framework comprises a mechanism for path planning simulation and estimation, a flexible network architecture for improved client-server(C/S) and peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity, as well as agents for identity authentications and secure communications.

841,841,A Computational Model of Autonomic Nervous System for Heart Rate Variability,"Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the subtle beat to beat changes in heart rate. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) regulates heart rate by controlling the neurotransmitters, mainly Norepinephrine (NE) and Acetyl choline (Ach) from sympathetic and parasympathetic branches respectively. HRV analysis is a noninvasive tool for assessing the integrity of ANS. HRV changes are observed in the onset of heart disease and in a number of disease conditions like sleep apnea, psychiatric disorders, diabetes, hypertension etc. An understanding of the relationship between kinetics at sympathetic and parasympathetic sites and HRV helps to identify biological changes associated with various autonomic imbalance conditions and hence help in targeted diagnosis and therapy. A computational model of ANS for heart rate regulation is proposed in this study. Fitzhugh Nagumo (FHN) model is used as the successive stage of proposed model to generate a discrete time heart beat interval series. HRV data from a group of healthy individuals having balanced sympathetic and parasympathetic activities were studied. The results were in agreement with parameters derived from model synthesized data for the same autonomic state.",60108974,Govt.

842,842,A Framework for Left Atrium Segmentation on CT Images with Combined Detection Network and Level Set Model,"In this paper, we proposed a framework for left atrium (LA) segmentation on CT with combined detection network and level set model. The proposed framework consists of two steps. Firstly, we trained a Faster RCNN to generate location boxes for LA. The obtained location box can remove unrelated regions to reduce the interference of background and similarity tissues. Secondly, we utilized a self-adapted threshold on the location box to get the initialization for the level set model, which is nearer the LA and more robust than the random and fixed initialization. Then we proposed a 3D level set model with a new edge indicator based on DRLSE for the final LA segmentation. This edge indicator incorporated both numerical and direction information of the data gradient. Hence, the proposed level set model can guide the contour to the correct boundary when there are many boundaries surrounded the object. The framework was trained and evaluated on MICCAI 2013 LA segmentation challenge. The proposed segmentation method achieved the Dice score of 86.46%. Comparing to the original DRLSE, it achieved a 2.72% improvement on the Dice score.",60019616,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China,['1700'],16.636363636363637,0.13613636363636364,0.4237878787878788,1

However, these models are often based on frameworks that do not take into account the real-time dimension, hence it is arduous to exploit them for taking short-term decisions over complex systems. The goal of this work is to prove the applicability of a Real-Time Simulation (RTS) framework that prescribes to exchange current-status data from a manufacturing system and to run alternative simulation models to decide the next moves. For this scope, we exploit a LEGO® Manufacturing System (LMS) together with a discrete event simulator that plays the role of its digital model.

This study investigates the use of the Meshless Local Petrov-Galerkin Mixed Collocation (MLPG-MC) method to simulate cardiac electrophysiology. MLPG-MC is a truly meshless method where both the unknown function and its gradient are interpolated using nodal collocation. A 3 cm × 3 cm human ventricular tissue was simulated based on the monodomain reaction-diffusion model using the operator splitting technique. MLPG-MC or FEM were used to solve the diffusion term and the O'Hara-Virág-Varró-Rudy AP model to represent cellular electrophysiology at baseline and under 30% IKr inhibition (IKr30). Mean differences between MLPG-MC and FEM in AP duration at 90% (APD90), 50% (APD50) and 20% (APD20) repolarization levels were 4.47%, 4.16% and 3.29% for baseline conditions and 3.66%, 2.10% and 1.62% for IKr30 conditions. The computational time associated with each of the two methods was comparable. In conclusion, considering that MLPG-MC does not involve any mesh requirements and is well suited for massive parallelization, this study shows that it represents a promising alternative to FEM for cardiac electrophysiology simulations.",60085101,"CIBER Bioingenieria, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina",Zaragoza,Spain,['1700'],24.375,-0.02729166666666667,0.33770833333333333,1

847,847,An Inventory-Routing Problem with Stochastic Demand and Stock-Out: A Solution and Risk Analysis Using Simheuristics,"Supply chain operations have become more complex. Hence, in order to optimise supply chain operations, we often need to simplify the optimisation problem in such a way that it can be solved efficiently using either exact methods or metaheuristics. One common simplification is to assume all model inputs are deterministic. However, for some management decisions, considering the uncertainty in model inputs (e.g., demands, travel times, processing times) is essential. Otherwise, the results may be misleading and might lead to an incorrect decision. This paper considers an example of a complex supply chain operation that can be viewed as an Inventory-Routing Problem with stochastic demands. We demonstrate how a simheuristic framework can be employed to solve the problem. Further, we illustrate the risks of not considering input uncertainty. The results show that simheuristics can produce a good result, and ignoring the uncertainty in the model input may lead to sub-optimal results.",60033019,Universidad Pública de Navarra,Pamplona,Spain,"['1712', '1706']",16.666666666666664,0.061111111111111116,0.4388888888888889,1

Existing research mostly focuses on small contests that typically consist of two or several perfectly rational agents. In practice, however, agents are often founded in complex environments that involve large numbers of players, and they usually use thresholding policies to make decisions. Despite the fact, there is a surprising lack of understanding of how contest factors influence their outcomes. Here, we present the first simulation analysis on how parameters of the contest success function, the population dynamics, and the agents' cutoff policies influence the outcomes of the contests with thresholding agents that are non-cooperative. Experimental results demonstrate that stakeholders can design (approximately) optimal contests to satisfy both their interests and the agents' by choosing a relatively low bias factor.

A small dataset composed of twenty signals recorded from ten pregnant women between the 21st and the 27th week of gestation was adopted. fECG extraction was accomplished by using a multireference QR-decomposition-based recursive least squares adaptive filter. Then, all signals were decomposed with the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and stationary wavelet packet transform (SWPT), using a 7-level decomposition with Haar mother wavelet and hard-thresholding. Two different thresholds from the literature were tested: the first one is level-independent (Minimax) while the other one is level-dependent. The latter was adapted to be exploited on SWPT.

Analyses on the normalized power in the low frequency band (LFn) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) were performed for patients on and off drug therapy.Although no significant differences were found, treating CR patients with ACE-inhibition or beta blockers (BB) tended to have an influence on the HRV parameters. The progression of the HRV parameters throughout CR was mostly characterized by a non-monotonic trend. These insights elucidate the changes occurring in the regulatory mechanisms.

The segments were further divided into; group A ≤ 30 s, group B > 30, density maps of different time durations were compared with the full 300 s.

861,861,Harnessing Concurrency in Synchronous Block Diagrams to Parallelize Simulation on Multi-Core Hosts,"Model-based and simulation-supported engineering based on the formalism of synchronous block diagrams is among the best practices in software development for embedded and real-time systems. As the complexity of such models and the associated computational demands for their simulation steadily increase, efficient execution strategies are needed. Although there is an inherent concurrency in most models, tools are not always capable of taking advantage of multi-core architectures of simulation host computers to simulate blocks in parallel. In this paper, we outline the conceptual obstacles in general and discuss them specifically for the widely used simulation environment Simulink. We present an execution mechanism that harnesses multi-core hosts for accelerating individual simulation runs through parallelization. The approach is based on a model transformation. It does not require any changes in the simulation engine, but introduces minimal data propagation delays in the simulated signal chains.

862,862,Anomaly Detection Semi-Supervised Framework for Sepsis Treatment,"Sepsis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitals. Early diagnosis could substantially improve the patient outcomes and reduce the mortality rate. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach for anomaly detection to aid the early detection of sepsis. Using the medical data of over 40, 000 patients [1], we use both unsupervised and supervised methods to extract relevant features from the data, and then use standard classification approaches to predict sepsis six hours before clinical diagnosis occurs. To extract features, we used the reconstruction error of an auto-encoding neural network trained on control patients free of sepsis, and used random forest classifiers to learn the most important features for the classification of patients. We then combined the features from both of these approaches with a variety of standard classification models. Cross-validation as well as the asymmetric utility function designed for this challenge are used to evaluate the resulting models. We obtained a utility function score for the full unseen dataset of 0.177 (Team Kriss); achieved with a logistic regression classifier.

In these events, millions of people gather at a specific location over a specific period of time from different regions of the world. Such settings have the potential to import and/or export infectious diseases to and from the host countries by international participants. Planning and preparing for public health risks at global mass gatherings is a challenging and complex process. Advanced risk assessment tools are important to identify potential disease outbreaks. In this study, we propose a computational epidemic simulation framework to simulate disease transmission from the arrival, to the departure of international participants in the global event of Hajj.

Nevertheless, their response to drugs when coupled forming a tissue is not fully understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether blocking L-type Ca+2 current (ICaL) in a hiPSC- CMs tissue could be considered as a potential antiarrhythmic procedure.To analyze the effects of ICaL block, the maximum conductance of ICaL (gCaL) was decreased (block conditions) and compared to control. In both situations, control and block, the tissue was stimulated following a cross-field protocol to generate re-entries. A phase analysis was performed and specific parameters, such as re-entry frequency (freentry), excitation wavelength, vulnerable window (VW), and cellular excitability, were evaluated.Induced re-entries, where ICaL was reduced by 70% showed a 6.9% and a 47.83% decrease in freentry and in the width of the VW, respectively.

It is similar to KPSAM in incorporating many clinical and operational details. On the other hand, it offers more flexibility in evaluating various policy proposals and runs significantly faster than KPSAM due to its efficient use of modern computing technologies.

Fortunately, there is a dimension collapse in the limit as the network size increases, where the equilibriated system converges to the unique fixed point involving a simple, one dimensional distribution-valued operator, which, we show, is amenable to simulation.

Our purpose is to refine this observation, by introducing a rescaling coefficient in space and study its effect on the MFS inverse solution. Results are provided using simulated test data prepared using a reaction-diffusion model. We then computed the ECGI inverse solution for rescaling coefficient values varying from 1 to 100, and computed the relative error (RE) and correlation coefficient (CC). This approach improved the RE and CC by at least 10 % but can go up to 40 % independently of the pacing site. We concluded that the optimal coefficient depends on the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the torso and does not depend on the stimulation site. This suggests that it is related to an optimal equivalent conductivity estimation in the torso domain.",60102125,Université de Bordeaux,Bordeaux,France,['1700'],19.333333333333332,-0.02333333333333333,0.2997222222222222,1

Initiatives like lean manufacturing, pooling, and postponement have been proven to be effective in mitigating the trade-offs by maintaining high levels of service while reducing system inventories. However, such initiatives reduce the buffers, exacerbating supply chain issues in the event of a disruption. We evaluate stocking decisions in the presence of operational disruptions caused by random events such as natural disasters or man-made disturbances. These disruptions represent different risks from those associated with demand uncertainties as they stop production flow and typically persist longer. Thus, operational disruptions can be much more devastating though their likelihood of occurrence may be low.

In this paper, we propose a system which decreases the post-accident response time of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in India by adding another layer of the patient transport vehicle. The paper discusses a new system design with simulation model and algorithm. Further, when compared with the traditional system, it provides an overall time reduction of approximately 3 minutes with a 97% survival rate.",60106942,Ahmedabad University,Ahmedabad,India,"['1712', '1706']",19.5,-0.03987603305785124,0.5026859504132232,1
890,890,Sensitivity Analysis of Policy Options for Urban Mental Health Using System Dynamics and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps,"Urban mental health challenges call for new ways of designing policies to address the ongoing mental health issues in cities. Policymaking for mental health in cities is extremely difficult due to the complex nature of mental health, the structure of cities, and their multiple subsystems. This paper presents a general system dynamic model of factors affecting mental health and a method to test the sensitivity of the model to policy options using an approach combining system dynamics and fuzzy cognitive maps. The method is developed and tested to evaluate policies built around feedback loops. The approach succeeded in identifying the factors that substantially improve the mental health of the city population for specific contexts. It also suggests the coordination needed between different subsystems to reach these objectives.",60002014,The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),Stockholm,Sweden,"['1712', '1706']",21.166666666666668,-0.07286096256684493,0.30124777183600715,1

Hundreds of heuristics have been proposed to solve the problem of bandwidth reduction since the mid-1960s. Previous publications have reviewed several heuristics for bandwidth reduction. Based on this experience, this paper evaluates nine low-cost symmetric permutations. Numerical simulations are presented to investigate the influence of these orderings on the convergence of the preconditioned GMRES solver restarted every 50 steps when applied to large-scale nonsymmetric and not positive definite matrices.

Previous applications within the literature focus on estimating manpower to meet production demand for a particular process. We extend that work by including system constraints that are more realistically represent the problem under consideration. The proposed model was used to find configurations of workers, shifts, and work stations that achieve a minimized deviation between output and demand while maintaining a near constant workforce. The system under consideration is a manufacturing environment and the model posits the production of certain product lines that are each composed of a series of disparate operations. The model was tested using real production data and the results show that Systems Dynamic Modeling is an effective method in estimating the long-run resource requirements for the variable demand profiles.",60001439,Pennsylvania State University,University Park,United States,"['1712', '1706']",24.833333333333332,0.08244047619047619,0.3844246031746032,1
893,893,Investigation of Versatile Datatypes for Representing Time in Discrete Event Simulation,"Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) is a technique in which the simulation engine plays a history following a chronology of events in which the processing of each event takes place at discrete points of a continuous timeline. The simulator must interact actively with time variables for reproducing the chronology of events over positive real numbers, which is usually represented by approximated datatypes as floating-point. Nevertheless, the approximation made by commonly used datatypes in simulations can affect the timeline, preventing the generation of correct results. To overcome this problem, we present two new versatile datatypes to represent time variables in DES. These new datatypes provide a wider range of numbers reducing approximation errors, and if an error occurs, the simulation user is notified. To test our datatypes, we perform an empirical evaluation in order to compare their performance.",60017592,Carleton University,Ottawa,Canada,"['1712', '1706']",22.5,0.011666666666666667,0.33045454545454545,1

Tetramers of HCN4 subunits constitute the ion channels that conduct the cardiac hyperpolarization-activated 'funny current' (If), which plays an important modulating role in the pacemaker activity of sinus node cells.We assessed the mechanism by which the A414G mutation in HCN4 causes sinus bradycardia. We carried out voltage clamp experiments on HCN4 channels expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and incorporated the experimentally observed mutation-induced changes in If into the Fabbri-Severi model of a single human sinus node cell.In the Fabbri-Severi model, the experimentally observed effects on If increased the cycle length from 813 to 1004 ms, corresponding with a 19% decrease in beating rate from 74 to 60 beats/min. These mutation effects became more prominent at 10 nM ACh (vagal tone) and in the presence of a hyperpolarizing atrial load.We conclude that the experimentally identified mutation-induced changes in If can explain the clinically observed sinus bradycardia in carriers of the A414G mutation in the HCN4 gene.",60002483,Universiteit van Amsterdam,Amsterdam,Netherlands,['1700'],44.5,0.14065934065934066,0.4703296703296704,1

The rupture of this plaques is responsible for most acute coronary events. Intracoronary optical coherence tomography (IOCT) enables a detailed high-resolution visualization of micro-structural changes of the arterial wall in vivo. In this paper, we introduce a new way of identifying atherosclerotic plaques using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) analyzing only the lumen contour. Training and test were performed with 1600 IOCT frames from in vivo patients. In our tests, we achieved f1-score of 95% for atherosclerotic plaque recognition. The results allow us to report an interesting correlation between the lumen contour geometry and the presence of plaques in the vascular wall observed through IOCT exams. The use of lumen contour for plaque detection opens two new perspectives: assisting specialists in the task of detecting plaques visually by paying special attention to the lumen and allowing methods to work in real time to detect plaques using efficient methods that use less information and deliver accurate results.",60107960,"IBM, Brasil",Sao Paulo,Brazil,['1700'],21.0,0.2330859616573902,0.5057513914656772,1

This technique can be viewed as a highly efficient control variate obtained by carefully choosing a function of the input variates, where the function lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with known mean thus ensuring unbiasedness. In large-scale simulation analysis, one often faces many input distributions for which some are amenable to CFs and some may not due to technical difficulties. We show that CFs retain good theoretical properties and lead to variance reduction in these situations. We also show that, even if the input variates are biasedly generated, CFs can correct for the bias but with a price on estimation efficiency. We compare these properties with importance sampling, in particular a version using a similar kernelized approach.",60030162,Columbia University in the City of New York,New York,United States,"['1712', '1706']",24.833333333333332,0.1058974358974359,0.4296794871794871,1

899,899,Simulation of solute clusters in metallic systems,"The arrangement of atoms in the microstructures of alloys plays a key role in defining their physical and functional properties. These microstructures are studied to detect deviations from the expected homogeneous distribution using frequency distribution tests and cluster detection algorithms on reconstructions obtained from atom probe microscopy. However, it is challenging to evaluate and validate the performance of these algorithms using the reconstructed data because of the experimental limitations of the atom probe data itself. Low detector efficiency and reconstructional artifacts may lead to loss of existing clusters, or introduce heterogeneities that do not reflect the original arrangement. Additionally, retrieving atom probe data is a time and cost-prohibitive process. These challenges call for the use of simulated datasets with known concentrations and distributions to evaluate algorithms that analyze distributions or detect clusters. In this paper, we extend the existing methodology to simulate the creation of solute clusters in very dilute solutions for any solution. We propose methods to create denser and wider clusters in any solution irrespective of the concentration. Three novel solute cluster simulation techniques incremental, hierarchical and gravitational clustering are presented and compared in this paper. The simulated datasets can be used to validate and compare the performance of frequency distribution or cluster discovery algorithms.

Initially, we use a simulator to generate synthetic signals from dynamic models containing variations within a set of physiological parameters. From the generation of twenty different types of QRS morphology, computing tests for mathematical modeling of the beat waveform (Q, R and S waves) were performed. For that, the following mathematical functions are employed: Gaussian function, Mexican Hat function and Rayleigh probability density function. Subsequently, 10 real signal records from the MIT-BIH (Massachucetts Institute Technology - Beth Israel Hospital) Arrhythmia database have their QRS complex morphologies also modeled by the proposed mathematical functions. The preliminary results demonstrate the proposed mathematical functions with adjustable parameters can be applied together for modeling and automatic classification of some QRS morphologies commonly present in real signals, with efficiency and precision. The computing of normalized RMS error allows the identification of the model which is more appropriate to a given morphology, which can change over the same patient record.",60020457,Universidade Federal do Ceara,Fortaleza,Brazil,['1700'],26.142857142857142,0.0380952380952381,0.1900793650793651,1
902,902,Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data via Heterogeneous Event Aggregation,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that seriously endangers millions of people over the world. Hopefully, with the widespread availability of electronic health records (EHR), predictive models that can effectively deal with clinical sequential data increase the possibility to predict sepsis and take early preventive treatment. However, the early prediction is challenging because patients' sequential data in EHR contains temporal interactions of multiple clinical events. And capturing temporal interactions in the long event sequence is hard for traditional LSTM. Rather than directly applying the LSTM model to the event sequences, our proposed model firstly aggregates heterogeneous clinical events in a short period and then captures temporal interactions of the aggregated representations with LSTM. Our proposed Heterogeneous Event Aggregation can not only shorten the length of clinical event sequence but also help to retain temporal interactions of both categorical and numerical features of clinical events in the multiple heads of the aggregation representations.

This arrhythmia is difficult to diagnose with ambulatory electrocardiogram monitors in the early stages due to its transient nature. Recent advances in wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) devices are promising for screening AF in large populations as they are relatively comfortable and can be worn over long periods of time. Herein, we propose a system to detect AF from PPG recordings. This system is composed of a beat detector to extract interbeat intervals and a classifier for detection. We trained the classifier on a large public database of interbeat intervals and then evaluated the whole system on PPG recordings collected during catheter ablation procedures. We achieve an accuracy of 0.986 for the detection of AF with a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.978 respectively.

We evaluated the net balance between synergy and redundancy of cardiac and cardiorespiratory controls from spontaneous variability of heart period (HP) and respiration (R). HP variability and R were recorded from 16 healthy subjects (22-58 yrs, 6 males) at rest (REST), during bicycle ergometer exercise at 10%, 20% and 30% of the maximum load and recovery. The net balance between synergy and redundancy was estimated via a linear regression approach along with HP mean, HP variance, HP power in the high frequency (HF, from 0.15 to 0.45 Hz) band (HFaHP) and squared HP-R coherence at HF [K2HP-R(HF)]. HP mean, HP variance and HFaHP power significantly decreased during exercise and K2HP-R(HF) tended to decline. The net balance between synergy and redundancy remained unvaried and was not correlated to traditional variability markers. Despite vagal withdrawal, complex cardiac and cardiorespiratory control interactions are preserved during exercise and indexes of synergy and redundancy might provide extra information that more traditional variability markers cannot capture.",60030318,Università degli Studi di Milano,Milan,Italy,['1700'],28.0,0.023416666666666662,0.3690833333333333,1

Early prediction and treatment of sepsis are critical. In response to the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2019, we developed an algorithm for early prediction of sepsis. Three datasets provided by the challenge are from ICU patients in three separate hospitals, two of which are publicly available to the participants, but the third is hidden and used for scoring. Data are highly unbalanced and contain many missing values. Each patient's data comprises hourly collected samples of 40 features. We preprocessed the data by a plausibility filter eliminating the outliers, forward filling of the missing data and replacing the remaining by population mean, and standardization of the numerical data. We developed an ensemble of bagged decision trees with a highly unbalanced misclassification cost to predict the sepsis for each sample of features in a patient. The classifier was trained on the first hospital dataset and validated on the second hospital dataset. A total of 15 important features and a set of hyperparameters were selected in an iterative training approach.

907,907,Comparison of Activation Times Estimation for Potential-Based ECG Imaging,"Activation times (AT) represent the sequence of cardiac depolarization and are one of the most important parameters of cardiac electrical activity. However, estimation of ATs is challenging due to multiple sources of noise. If ATs are estimated from signals reconstructed using electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI), additional problems can arise due to over-smoothing or ambiguities in the inverse problem. Resulting AT maps can show falsely homogeneous regions or artificial lines of block. As ATs are not only important clinically, but are also used for evaluation of ECGI, it is important to understand where these errors come from.We present results from a community effort to compare AT estimation methods on a common dataset of simulated ventricular pacings. ECGI reconstructions were performed in terms of transmembrane voltages as well as epiendo and pericardial potentials, all using 2nd-order Tikhonov and 6 regularization parameters. ATs were then estimated by the participants and compared to the truth.While the pacing site had the largest effect on AT correlation coefficients (CC), there were also differences between methods and source models that were poorly reflected in CCs. Results indicate that artificial lines of block are most severe for purely temporal methods. Compared to the other source models, ATs estimated from transmembrane voltages are more precise and less prone to artifacts.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,['1700'],23.333333333333332,0.03793995859213251,0.5518115942028985,1

The new modeling feature is that a social planner can decide to shut down some asset markets so that no traders can trade these assets. We show that closing down some asset markets can increase the total volume of trades by all traders. This is because a smaller number of assets available to trade can reduce coordination failures between different traders, and therefore improves the overall matching efficiency. Using numerical simulation, we study the optimal numbers of markets to open under different scenarios. This has practical implications towards the optimal design of session-based trading protocols in the corporate and municipal bond markets. This problem naturally leads to the use of simulation to select the best system from all possible market design choices.

The core of this method includes three steps. Firstly, we present a calibration method of line-scan camera to rotary table. Secondly, we present an optimized robust regression algorithm for circle fitting. Finally, we present an algorithm to extract the subpixel tooth profile of noisy gear image. This method can measure the inner diameter, addendum circle diameter, root diameter, roundness, concentricity, circular run-out, common normal, thickness, flatness, chamfer and burr of gear.

This mutation results in impaired cardiac sodium channel function and is associated with increased ventricular arrhythmogenic risk which can result in sudden cardiac death. Lead I and Lead II ECG signals from wild-type and Scn5a+/- mice are used and the mice are also grouped as female/male and young/old.We use our novel Symmetric Projection Attractor Reconstruction (SPAR) method to generate an attractor from the ECG signal using all of the available waveform data. We have previously manually extracted a variety of quantitative measures from the attractor and used machine learning to classify each animal as either wild-type or mutant. In this work, we take the attractor images and use these as input to a deep learning algorithm in order to perform the same classification. As there is only data available from 42 mice, we use a transfer learning approach in which a network that has been pretrained on millions of images is used as a starting point and the last few layers are changed in order to fine tune the network for the attractor images.The results for the transfer learning approach are not as good as for the manual features, which is not too surprising as the networks have not been trained on attractor images.

The proposed study describes a signal processing scheme for selecting valve areas from maximum intensity projection valve images in a cohort of 52+43 patient images, diagnosed as having severe and moderate DAS. First the valve center and perimeter are approximated by a manually determined circle of radius r and center (x, y). The circle is then used to define eight masks, based on concentric circles of radius r2, r√ 2 2, r√ 3 2 and r, each with center (x, y). The masks are used to define pixel regions within the valvular area, and statistical and textural descriptors are applied to each. Sensitivity/ specificity testing is performed with these descriptors, applied to the pixels within each mask, which show that disease severity is best predicted by using the smallest, most central mask and statistical features of skewness and kurtosis, providing area under the curve of 0.844 and 0.840 respectively.

Their closed-form quantile functions (F-1) enable fast and convenient simulation. The previously unsolved problem of a closed-form analytical expression for the sum of lognormals is one application. Uses include simulating total impact of an uncertain number N of risk events (each with iid [independent, identically distributed] individual lognormal impact), noise in wireless communications networks and many others. Beyond sums of lognormals, the approach may be directly applied to represent and subsequently simulate sums of iid variables from virtually any continuous distribution, and, more broadly, to products, extreme values, or other many-to-one change of iid or correlated variables.",124030960,Lnmina Decision Systems,Campbell,United States,"['1712', '1706']",25.0,0.09904100529100529,0.46994047619047624,1

It can be operated directly by supplying the resistive wire with controllable electrical power, which is different from traditional fluidic artificial muscles requiring external pressure generating devices. To verify the effectiveness of the artificial muscle, prototypes are fabricated and the process is presented in detail.

917,917,A New Reward Function for Bayesian Feasibility Determination,"In Bayesian feasibility determination, a typical reward function is either the 0-1 or linear reward function. We propose a new type of reward function for Bayesian feasibility determination. Our proposed reward function emphasizes the importance of barely feasible/infeasible systems whose mean performance measures are close to the threshold. There are two main reasons why the barely feasible/infeasible systems are more important. First, the overall accuracy on solving a feasibility determination problem is heavily affected by those difficult systems. Second, if the decision maker wants to further find the best feasible system, it is likely that one of the barely feasible/infeasible systems is the best feasible. We derive a feasibility determination procedure with the new reward function in a Bayesian framework. Our experiments show that the Bayesian optimal procedure with the new reward function performs the best in making correct decisions on difficult systems when compared to existing procedures.",60019647,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,United States,"['1712', '1706']",18.5,0.14767786561264823,0.4355566534914361,1

These techniques are increasingly used together, particularly as hybrid models. We propose the first review of this emerging practice and identified 31 articles that combined the two techniques. Our analysis revealed three different high-level architectures to structure the combined use of ABMs and FCMs, such as using an interface or embedding an FCM into each agent.

Such problems frequently arise as first order necessary conditions in global simulation optimization problems. A convenient method of solving such problems involves generating (using a fixed sample) a sample-path approximation of the functions involved, and then executing a convergent root-finding algorithm with several random restarts. The various solutions obtained thus are then gathered to form the estimator of the true set. We investigate the quality of the returned set in terms of the expected Hausdorff distance between the returned and true sets. Our message is that a certain simple logarithmic relationship between the sample size and the number of random restarts ensures maximal efficiency.",60028629,College of Science,West Lafayette,United States,"['1712', '1706']",22.666666666666668,0.015546218487394955,0.4683473389355743,1

Here, we apply GFNNs to the detection of low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) oscillations in cardiovascular signals, namely the heart rate variations associated with Mayer waves and with respiration, respectively. The cardiovascular time series is treated as music audio for analysis; the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal is processed as a WAV file, and R-R intervals converted to a MIDI file. GFNNs are networks of nonlinear neural oscillators that offer the advantage of high sensitivity at low stimulus amplitudes, compared to linear amplitude responses, for weak signals. The GFNNs entrained with prominent LF peaks at 0. 0837 ± 0.0175Hz to R-R intervals of Kundalini meditators from the Physio Bank Exaggerated Heart Rate Oscillations database. When applied to a 15-hour Holter recording of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation, GFNN entrainment showed significant LF activity between 0.04-0.14Hz, and HF activity at ~ 0.25Hz during sleep.

Based on the threshold effect they showed, the time courses of all measures were divided into before (BTP) and after (ATP) threshold periods. Time courses of CFLFSP, CFLFDP and CFLFRR showed: 1. similar patterned responses of gradual increment in BTP, abrupt decrease in ATP and fast increment in the initial recovery period (IRP), inverse to the pattern presented by PLF dynamics; 2. 20-s epoch means (EM) differences (p<0.04) between them in control and BTP according to the inequality CFLFRR>CFLFSP>CFLFDP, that disappeared in ATP and IRP. CFLF-PLF correlations (p<0.01) of the three variables were negative and greater (p<0.01) in ATP than BTP and IRP.

In this manuscript, the method of qualitative comparison of late electrical activation zone's position and area of fibrosis based on 17-segment approach is presented. To demonstrate performance of the proposed method, we studied sixty one patients scheduled as a potential candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy. ECGI was performed using Amycard 01C EP LAB (EP Solutions SA, Switzerland). The late activation zone (LAZ) on a wide QRS complex with different morphology pattern was variable from anterior till inferior left ventricle (LV) wall. According to the MRI data, 41(67%) patients had fibrosis areas which did not coincide with the LAZ. 9(15%) participants had transmural scar involving epicardium of LV which localization coincided with the LAZ. In the remaining 11(18%) cases nontransmural scar excluding epicardial layer coincided with the LAZ. Taking these results into account, it is reasonable to assume that comparative qualitative analysis of ECGI and MRI data demonstrates coincidence of LAZ with fibrosis areas only in 33% of cases.",60116616,EP Solutions SA,Yverdon-les-Bains,Switzerland,['1700'],19.333333333333332,-0.05909090909090908,0.5181818181818181,1

Annually, 300.000 babies die during pregnancy or infancy because of CHD. Early detection of CHD leads to reduced mortality and morbidity, but is hampered by the relatively low detection rates (i.e. <60%) of current CHD screening technology. This detection rate could be improved by complementing echocardiographic screening with assessment of the fetal electrocardiogram (ECG).In this study, the fetal ECG was measured non-invasively, with electrodes on the maternal abdomen, in almost 400 fetuses, 30% of which had known CHD. The fetal ECG measurements were processed to yield a 3-dimensional fetal vectorcardiogram. A deep neural network was trained to classify this fetal vectorcardiogram as either originating from a healthy fetus or CHD. The network was evaluated on a test set of about 100 patients, showing a CHD detection accuracy of 76%. Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography therefore shows clear potential in diagnosis of CHD and should be considered as supplementary technology next to echocardiography.",60032882,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Eindhoven,Netherlands,['1700'],18.333333333333332,0.09629629629629628,0.40185185185185185,1

Several alumina vibrating bodies were fabricated and bonded to annular lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) disks to form ring-shaped vibrators, where traveling waves with the 3rd bending modes were excited to frictionally drive the rotor. First, we explored the fundamental vibration properties. As predicted, the alumina/PZT vibrators provided relatively high force factors, high electromechanical coupling factors, and low damping compared to the stainless-steel/PZT one with similar structure. Subsequently, through experimental assessment on load characteristics, we found that the rotation speed of the alumina/PZT motor at 20 V was larger than that of the stainless-steel/PZT motor at 250 V, and meanwhile, it exhibited superior maximal-torque-to-voltage and maximal-output-power-to-voltage ratios; these results imply that satisfactory performance is achievable with our motor.

Since effect of L-carnitine on cardiovascular regulation is unclear we investigated whether its prolonged supplementation would affect autonomic nervous system (ANS) control upon the heart in healthy elderly volunteers.Thirteen apparently healthy women aged 64 to 71 were supplemented in the double-blinded fashion with either 1.5 g of L-carnitine or placebo for 24 weeks. High resolution electrocardiogram was recorded before and after the supplementation. Time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was performed to assess ANS control on the heart.Following L-carnitine supplementation the overall HRV represented by TSP or SDNN insignificantly decreased with a significant reduction of parasympathetic-related HRV indexes: rMSSD, HF and SD1. Consistently, a tendency towards an increase of indexes of sympathovagal balance: SDNN/rMSSD and SD2/SD1 may reflect vagal withdrawal.

A way to cure VT is to ablate the exit site with an endocardial catheter. But it can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to localize this exit site accurately enough.We propose a process to accelerate catheter ablation using an automatic method to guide the catheter towards the exit site. The proposed process uses the QRS complex integral of the 12-lead ECG. The method was tested using a realistic numerical forward model with pacing sites in endocardial, epicardial, and mid-myocardial tissue.With 12 pacing sites, 6 targets had been approximated to less than 1 mm.

The first algorithm is based on substitution of the pseudoinverse transfer matrix for the single layer into the alternative BEM equation (ESL-EP). The second extension consists in an iterative update of the two BEM equations, while alternating between the epicardial potentials and their normal derivative. The third solution approach results from weighting the initial ESL solution with ESL-EP. We tested the proposed algorithms on three in silico and twenty clinical cases for ectopic ventricular excitation and quantitatively compared their performance in terms of reconstructed activation times and earliest activation areas, respectively.The methods featured distinct results with the best mean localization accuracy obtained by the initial ESL and the weighted approaches.

This variance contribution can be written in terms of the sensitivity estimate of the output and the variance of the input distributions or parameters, via the delta method. We study the direct use of this representation in obtaining efficient estimators for the input-contributed variance, by using finite-difference and random perturbation to approximate the gradient, focusing especially in the nonparametric case. In particular, we analyze a particular type of random perturbation motivated from resampling that connects to an infinitesimal jackknife estimator used in bagging.

A standard approach is to use the finite difference method or its variants. While natural, it is open to our knowledge whether its statistical accuracy is the best possible. This paper argues that this is nearly so in a well-defined minimax sense. In particular, we show that central finite-difference is an optimal zeroth-order derivative estimator among the class of linear estimators, over the worst-case scenario among a wide class of twice differentiable functions. This optimality is achieved exactly for any finite sample in the single-dimensional case, and nearly (up to a multiplicative factor) in the multi-dimensional case. We also show that the same estimator is nearly optimal among the much larger class of all (nonlinear) estimators.

Implementations based on crossbar arrays provide a promising approach to perform this operation with an analogue circuit. In comparison to purely digital solutions, significant improvements in processing speed and power consumption can be expected when applying this approach. However, securing the accuracy is more difficult than in the digital case. Primary reasons include nonlinearities of essential resistive elements and non-zero resistances of wiring lines. Many publications have dealt with this topic in the recent years analysing the different influences in different ways. We provide a unified approach based on the well-known indefinite admittance matrix concept for the description of the terminal behaviour of analogue multi-poles for the parametrization of crossbar arrays and for the estimation of computational error limits. This paper describes work in progress. It illustrates the procedures through a number of examples using modelling and simulation capabilities of VHDL-AMS. This behavioural modelling language seems particularly suitable for investigations on tailored implementations using VMM.

In this context, we propose to use digital television to create a community of digital volunteers who can help to identify objects inside images that cannot be processed automatically. Digital television can help to reach a larger number of digital volunteers because it can be easily used without installing special applications.

Vibration signals were collected in a four by four grid with 16 three-axis accelerometers placed on the chest of 11 healthy males. The visualization methods were investigated for their abilities to show temporal, spatial, and directional information. Of the four methods the SCG chart shows best temporal and small amplitude sensitivity information. Color plots provides an improved spatial overview. Tracking maps provide good directionality.

Insights from Computational Simulations,"Hyperkalemia, acidosis and hypoxia are the three main components of acute myocardial ischemia. In particular, the increase of extracellular K+ concentration (hyperkalemia), has been proved to be very proarrhythmic because it sets the stage for ventricular fibrillation. However, the intimate mechanisms remain partially unknown. The aim of this work was to investigate, using computational simulation, the relationship between the different phases of hiperkalemia, the activity of the ion channels and the changes related to the action potential in the absence of coronary flow. Our results show that the partial inhibition of the sodium-potassium pump is the main cause of extracellular potassium accumulation. However, the cause of the plateau phase could be due to the appearance of action potential alternans, which reduces the net potassium efflux and limits the increase of extracellular potassium concentration.",60023256,Politecnico di Milano,Milan,Italy,['1700'],22.166666666666668,0.08014705882352942,0.4279411764705882,1
945,945,Baseline Wandering Removal in Optical Mapping Measurements with PID Control in Phase Space,"Optical imaging methods on ex-vivo hearts have had large impact in furthering our understanding of cardiac electrophysiology. One common problem in this method is a baseline wandering of the fluorescence signals over time, caused by dye photo-bleaching, small variation of the excitation light source, or other similar artifacts. Due to its relative magnitude, the removal of baseline wandering can be a nontrivial task and has major implications for analyzing important physiological dynamics such as traveling waves and alternans. Here we present a computational technique for the removal of such baseline wandering based on Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) closed loop feedback. The PID method applied a continuous control stimulus to the input Vm based on an error value which is defined by Euclidean distance from a pre-computed setpoint in phase space. We quantify and validate the PID control method by adding a linear combination of arbitrary sinusoidal drift, of frequency less than the signal pacing frequency, to the system signal Vm. The PID control loop effectively removed the baseline wandering with minimal degradation to the input Vm, and thus provides a viable tool for baseline wandering removal when implemented in an appropriate phase space. The computational simplicity of the method also lends itself to implementation in embedded systems, such as Arduinos and Raspberry-Pis.",60019647,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,United States,['1700'],26.25,0.040958049886621314,0.4212018140589569,1

However, as multiple fringe patterns are used in PSP, the object is required to be kept static during the measurement. Errors will be introduced when moving object is reconstructed. This paper proposes a new method to reconstruct the multiple moving objects based on PSP. The multiple objects can have different movement. At first, the objects are tracked separately. Then, the rotation matrix and translation vector describing the movement for each object are obtained. With the relationship between the object movement and the phase value, the reconstruction model employing the movement information is used to eliminate the errors caused by the movement.

Training data are from the 2018 China physiological signal challenge (934 PVC and 906 non-PVC recordings). The first 10-s ECG waveforms in each recording were transformed into 2-D time-frequency images (frequency range of 0-50 Hz and size of 300 × 100) using MFSWT.

Results obtained with high resolution (HR) computer models must be translated to realistic numbers of leads. This study aims to evaluate the impact on atrial tachycardia (AT), flutter (AFL) and fibrillation (AF) characterization by reducing the number of BSPM leads. 19 realistic computer simulations with 567 leads (HR) have been used to characterize the arrhythmias concerning the dominant frequencies (DF) and phase singularity point (SP) distributions. DF maps were generated combining Welch periodogram and activation detection with wavelet transform modulus maxima. Phase was calculated with Hilbert transform on signals filtered around the highest DF (±1Hz); dynamics of SPs were analyzed using histograms (heatmaps, HMs) and connecting SPs along time (filaments). The analyses were reproduced for 6 layouts with 252 to 16 leads and results were compared using the structural similarity index (SSIM), sensitivity and precision in SP detection and analyzing features extracted from the maps. SSIM was lower in AF than in AFL or AT for DF maps and HMs, but was in average above 0.6 for layouts with 32 leads or more. In HMs, a loss in spatial resolution with fewer leads is reflected in decreasing values for sensitivity and precision. Features from DF maps, filaments or HMs were statistically equivalent in all layouts.",60011476,Universitat Politècnica de València,Valencia,Spain,['1700'],21.9,0.15541666666666665,0.5258333333333334,1

In an attempt to face this challenge, high dimensional search techniques try to identify and leverage upon the effective, lower, dimensionality of the problem either in the original or in a transformed space. As a result, algorithms search for and exploit a projection or create a random embedding. Our approach avoids modeling of high dimensional spaces, and the assumption of low effective dimensionality. We argue that effectively high dimensional functions can be recursively optimized over sets of complementary lower dimensional subspaces. In this light, we propose the novel Subspace COmmunication for OPtimization (SCOOP) algorithm, which enables intelligent information sharing among subspaces such that each subspace guides the other towards improved locations.

Chest leads were removed and the 6 limb leads then used for analysis of rhythm. Similarly, lead I alone was used. Separately 100 single lead I ECGs classified as AF in the PhysioNet 2017 database were analysed, both as single 30s recordings and as five 10s ECGs commencing at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20s from the start of the recording.

Fortunately, software-only changes to this command element can be evaluated and fielded much more quickly than hardware-based changes; and hence, methods to identify viable software-only changes are needed. This study presents a simulation optimization methodology to identify and evaluate such changes using a notional scenario. First, a raid of ASCM threats against a single ship is simulated and then metaheuristics are used to determine the configuration for a ship's defensive system that maximizes survival. The simulation scenario, a ship's defensive system, and three specific optimization cases are presented.

Traditional design of experiments methods determine the measurement locations upfront, while a sequential approach iteratively extends the design. Typically, the cost of traveling between sample locations can be ignored, for example in simulation experiments. In those cases, the experimental design is generated using a point-based method. However, if traveling towards the next sample location incurs an additional cost, line-based sampling methods are favored. In this setting, the sampling algorithm needs to generate a route of measurement locations. A common engineering problem is locating the global optimum.

The goal of this work is to study if temporal stability of dominant frequencies (DFs) of electrograms (EGMs) can be used as predictor of AF recurrence.EGMs were recorded from 29 AF patients using 64-pole basket catheters during the ablation procedure. DFs before ablation were obtained for 4-second overlapping fragments of EGM recordings with a 0.4 s shift, and their temporal stability was evaluated for short-term (between 8 and 12 s) and long-term time intervals (>5 min). Patients were classified as AF (N=15) if sinus rhythm was not maintained in a 12-month post-ablation follow-up, and AF free otherwise (N=14).Significant differences were found in the short-term analysis between AF free and AF patients for the difference between the mode value in DFs (p=0.045), as well as for the long-term analysis for the normalized average between DFs (p=0.028) and the average between DFs (p=0.043).

964,964,A Data Farming Analysis of A Simulation of Armstrong's Stochastic Salvo Model,"In 1995, Retired Navy Captain Wayne Hughes formulated a salvo model for assessing the military worth of warship capabilities in the missile age. Hughes' model is deterministic, and therefore provides no information about the distribution of outcomes that result from inherently stochastic salvo exchanges. To address this, Michael Armstrong created a stochastic salvo model by transforming some of Hughes' fixed inputs into random variables. Using approximations, Armstrong provided closed-form solutions that obtain probabilistic outcomes. This paper investigates Armstrong's stochastic salvo model using data farming. By using a sophisticated design of experiments to run a simulation at thousands of carefully selected input combinations, responses such as ship losses are formulated as readily interpretable regression and partition tree metamodels of the inputs.

ECGs were recorded for a period of approximately 6 minutes for each subject and sampled at a frequency of 2048 Hz. Wavelet-based filtering using Daubechies 4 wavelet decomposition and soft threshold was applied to each lead. QRS detection performance was assessed against Lead I for each subject. This investigation found that a lead positioned transversally (using BIS gelled electrodes) on the upper arm provided the best accuracy against the benchmark QRS detection (SEN = 0.998, PPV = 0.984).

The main motivations are enabling extensions to support dynamically varying model structure, faster compilation, and faster recompilation of models after changes. We are investigating two approaches. The first approach is to adapt the low-level OpenModelica intermediate representation (IR) before code generation to be compatible with LLVM. In that way we can avoid generating intermediate C-code and instead generate LLVM IR in memory for just-in-time compilation (JIT). The second approach is to translate OMC itself written in MetaModelica to Julia, and thereby gain access to the JIT capabilities of LLVM. Another benefit of the second approach is the access to the Julia ecosystem, including a rich set of libraries for numerical computing. We have done a preliminary investigation of both approaches, with measurements on a selected sample of algorithms, and discovered that compilation-time of generated Julia code is slower compared to generating LLVM IR directly. We conclude that providing a standard-compliant Modelica compiler which supports a dynamically varying model structure is feasible and possible, and we believe that such a compiler can be provided by using Julia or MetaModelica.",60009358,Linköpings universitet,Linkoping,Sweden,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.666666666666668,0.11145833333333333,0.4145833333333333,1

A simple method for generating arrivals from the resulting intensity function also presented. Splines are a natural choice for modelling intensity functions as they are smooth by construction, and highly flexible. Although flexibility is an advantage in terms of reducing the bias with respect to the true intensity function, it can lead to overfitting. Our method is therefore based on maximising the penalised NHPP log-likelihood, where the penalty is a measure of rapid changes in the spline-based representation. An empirical comparison of the spline-based method against two recently developed input modelling techniques is presented, along with an illustration of the method given arrivals from a real-world accident and emergency (AE) department.",60023643,Lancaster University,Lancaster,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1706']",22.166666666666668,0.17285714285714288,0.406734693877551,1

Nonetheless, a full 3D characterization of atrial functional measurements would provide more insights into LA function. But this improved modeling capacity comes at a price of requiring LA segmentation of each 3D time point, a time-consuming and expensive task that requires anatomy-specific expertise.We propose an efficient pipeline which requires ground truth segmentation of a single (or limited) CINE time point to accurately propagate it throughout the sequence. This method significantly saves human effort and enable better characterization of LA anatomy. From a gated cardiac CINE MRI sequence we select a single CINE time point with ground truth segmentation, and assuming cyclic motion, we register other images corresponding to all time points using diffeomorphic registration in ANTs. The diffeomorphic registration fields allow us to map a given anatomical shape (segmentation) to each CINE time point, facilitating the construction of a 4D shape model.",60025488,The University of Utah,Salt Lake City,United States,['1700'],27.5,0.07285714285714287,0.3441269841269841,1

Signals captured from the sampled region are extended to the unsampled region before being utilized in computational models. The resulting errors have never been evaluated systematically. We explored this relationship using a novel experimental preparation, and compared the resulting measurements against a set of reconstruction methods. Methods: Measurements came from a modified Langendorff preparation in which we placed a heart shaped pericardiac cage electrode array around an isolated canine heart within an electrolyte filled torso-tank. We optimized a reconstruction from one region of the cage to another and compared the reconstruction to surface Laplacian interpolation.Results: Qualitative and calculated error metrics showed lower error between optimized and measured signals, whereas Laplacian interpolation resulted in poorer reconstructions in most cases.Discussion: We utilized novel recordings to investigate reconstruction of unsampled signals, demonstrating that a sampled subset of signals is sufficient to reconstruct the unsampled subset and that Laplacian interpolation does not achieve the level of accuracy that is possible.",60025488,The University of Utah,Salt Lake City,United States,['1700'],29.0,0.1619047619047619,0.5285714285714286,1

This study aims to automatically classify HCM cases into subtypes via two-dimensional endocardial curvature and dynamic time wrapping (DTW). A total of 19 HCM patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scans. Endocardial boundaries were delineated on long axis images. Endocardial curvatures were computed. Dynamic time wrapping and its variant soft-DTW were used to quantify the dissimilarity between a pair of endocardial curvature series. The dissimilarity was utlized in classifiers. The classifier using DTW has a 0.84 in-sample accuracy and 0.58 out-of-sample accuracy. Soft-DTW has a 0.79 in-sample accuracy and 0.68 out-of-sample accuracy.

The crucial condition is that measurements arrive in scans from one or more sensors, but otherwise the conditions are minimally restrictive. In order to produce a computationally feasible implementation of MHT, some approximations must be made, but this true is for any (existing) method of producing an exact Bayesian solution. Limiting the number of hypotheses considered is an example of such an approximation.

In this study we explored the potential use of local conduction velocity (CV) during pacing as a marker of left atrial (LA) substrate complexity.Methods: LA activation times were recorded for 7 AF patients during coronary sinus (CS) pacing before PVI using a Pentaray catheter. Activation times were relative to the CS pacing spike. LA activation locations were triangularized to calculate CV: the local direction and speed of the activation wave front. CV was quantified by the total CV distribution.Results: A mean of 1622 CVs were calculated per patient. Distribution of CVs showed a similar morphology, with median CVs in the range [0.26, 0.36] and interquartile ranges in the range [0.29, 0.39].Conclusion: This study shows that although it is feasible to calculate CVs based on sequential CARTO mapping of the LA during CS pacing, the resulting distribution of CVs using this procedure is not necessarily able to identify substrate complexity because of the large similarity between distributions and the relatively small differences in medians.",60070744,Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht,Maastricht,Netherlands,['1700'],33.333333333333336,-0.0690934065934066,0.395467032967033,1

Electrical and mechanical interactions between the cells in tissue, as well as intracellular mechano-electric feedback beat-to-beat affect the functional characteristics of coupled cardiomyocytes further, adjusting their electrical and mechanical heterogeneity to the activation timing.

Seven algorithms were tested: The winning CinC13 entry from Varanini et al. and six algorithms from the unofficial top-scoring CinC13 entry by Behar et al. Two accuracy measures were used: 1) The RMSE between the FECG-based FHR and CTG traces; 2) The Pearson correlation coefficient r between the FECG-based FHR and CTG trace and its average over all recordings, r. The algorithms with the lowest RMSE's are Behar's FUSE-SMOOTH, a constant FHR, and Varanini, while the Varanini algorithm delivers the best correlation with the CTG trace (r = 0.73) with 41% of the recordings having r > 0.8, whereas the other algorithms have r ≤ 0.59 and ≤ 29% of the recordings with r > 0.8.

Reentries located in regions with poor-quality EGMs were then removed, increasing the AUC to 0.80. The EGM classification algorithm showed a similar performance both for low-quality EGM identification (sensitivity 0.91 and specificity 0.80) and for reentrant activity location with 3D phase analysis (AUC 0.80).Discard of reentrant activity identified in regions where EGMs showed low quality significantly improved the specificity of the 3D phase analysis.

Significant progress has been made in computing body-surface potentials from cardiac sources by solving the forward problem of electrocardiography. However, the lack of in vivo studies to validate such computations from ischemic sources has limited the translational potential of such models. We have developed a large-animal experimental model that includes simultaneous recordings within the myocardium, on the epicardial surface, and on the torso surface during episodes of acute, controlled ischemia with comprehensive imaging and subject specific modeling for each animal. We then identified ischemic sources and used the finite element method to solve a static bidomain equation on a geometric model to compute torso surface potentials. Across 33 individual heartbeats, the forward computed torso potentials showed only moderate agreement in both pattern and amplitude with Pearson's correlation coefficient, root mean squared error, and absolute error varying significantly by heartbeat (0.1642 ± 0.223, 0.10 ± 0.03mV, and 0.08±0.03mV, respectively).

Such an early detection would allow for the improvement of sepsis outcome.Our technique is based on the assumption that accurate and early prediction of sepsis requires to be able to predict the evolution of the vital signs. This idea was translated in the use of a recurrent neural network, a Long Short-term memory (LSTM) network, which was trained to accomplish two tasks: the prediction of (i) sepsis and (ii) the vital signs at time t+6. We assume that the use of this auxiliary task allows for a better training of the network given the low prevalence of sepsis.

Controlled rolling is an effective method of both increasing the strength of steel plates and improving their toughness. Techniques for controlling the texture of polycrystalline materials are very important because texture distribution has a strong effect not only on the characteristics of steel plates but also on their mechanical and toughness properties. However, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the evolution of the plate rolling texture through experimentation because the plate rolling process includes recrystallization and transformation. For this purpose, a recently developed hybrid numerical approach that involves the integrated use of the crystal plasticity (CP) finite element method and the CP fast Fourier transform method was employed in this study. With this hybrid method, the influence of the plate rolling conditions on the deformed/transformed texture evolution and the influence of texture distribution in the thickness direction on the fracture toughness can be captured.

Insights based upon our model inform how and when stakeholders can impact one another's operations and should thereby provide a data-driven, strategic approach to inform the security plans of individual companies and shipping ports as a whole.",60000745,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Urbana,United States,"['1712', '1706']",29.4,0.0475,0.41,1
992,992,A New Graphical Method for Reporting Performance Results of a Diagnostic Test,"Reporting diagnostic performance results using standard performance measures, such as: sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values, have been a standard practice for decades. Issues with reporting using only numerical values include: 1) often only a subset of performance measures are reported, thus results could be misinterpreted and misused, 2) difficult to visualize the complex relationships of the reported performance measures. To overcome these shortcomings, a graphical presentation has been developed to further improve the test results reporting.The 2-dimentional performance graph uses line segment, area, ratio of line segments, ratio of areas, and sum of areas to represent most of the commonly used performance measures in this single graph.Advantages of the new graphic presentation are: 1) large number of performance measures can be presented and visualized simultaneously in a single graph, 2) allow the complex relationships of all performance measures to be understood more easily, 3) reduce the need to memorize some of the complex formulas for computing the performance measures, and 4) a great teaching tool in explaining the relationships of the commonly used performance measures.",60106716,Philips Healthcare Nederland,Eindhoven,Netherlands,['1700'],58.333333333333336,0.024596615505706413,0.4906828020464385,1
993,993,Utilizing Informative Missingness for Early Prediction of Sepsis,"Aims: Physicians have to routinely make crucial decisions about patients' health in the ICU. Sepsis affects about 35% of ICU patients, killing approximately 25% of the afflicted. In this paper, we aim to predict the occurrence of sepsis early by studying the missingness of physiological variables and using it with the overall trends in data.Methods: We chose XGBoost as our base model and tried several variations by changing hyperparameters, window sizes and imputation methods. To further improve the model, we used masking vectors to represent the missingness of features in the dataset. Additional modifications include shifting the Sepsis Label to earlier time steps and tuning the classification probability threshold to further improve the model's performance.Results: The XGBoost model with a sliding window of size 5, no imputation, utilizing informative missingness of all temporal variables and trained on labels shifted by 3 hours before toptimal, achieved a Utility Score of 0.337 on the full test set.

994,994,Causal Relationship Analysis of Heart Rate Variability and Band Power Time Series of Electroencephalographic Signals,"This study aimed to find whether there is a causal relationship between band power time series (BPts) extracted from EEG and heart rate variability (HRV). Such relationships were explored during spontaneous and a controlled breathing tasks. Data analyzed were recordings obtained from 14 healthy subjects using one ECG lead and 21 EEG channels. The RR intervals from the ECG were used to obtain the HRV signal, which was decomposed with Empirical Mode Decomposition into components of different spectral content known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Granger causality tests were run for the BPts of alpha, beta and gamma frequency ranges of the EEG signal and the HRV signals IMFs. G-causality increased for three different conditions: slower IMFs (IMF4), BPts of higher frequency (gamma) band and during task realization. Meaning, gamma's BPts G-caused HRV for a larger number of subjects and channels. Also there was a larger incidence on the number of channels that G-caused HRV during the controlled breathing task. The causal influence from the BPts of EEG signals to the HRV IMFs suggests there is an indirect or unobserved interaction between instantaneous changes on EEG band power and components of HRV which may explain changes in its dynamics.",60014923,Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana,Mexico City,Mexico,['1700'],22.11111111111111,0.16111111111111112,0.5222222222222223,1
995,995,Automated 3D MRI Aortic Morphometry Demonstrates the Added Value of Volumes as Compared to Diameters,"Aim: The diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysm is based on local aortic deformation associated to excessive aortic diameter (D). Maximal local aortic diameter was shown to be below the recommended surgical threshold in 30% of patients who ultimately developed aortic dissection. Aortic volumes integrate both dilation and elongation and may be more sensitive to changes in aortic geometry and less dependent on slice orientation and obliquity than diameter measurements. Methods: We studied 278 asymptomatic individuals with 3D aortic MRI: 119 healthy volunteers (hC), 53 hypertensive patients (HT) and 106 patients with dilated ascending aorta of which 62 with tricuspid (APt) and 44 with bicuspid (APb) aortic valve. Automated 3D aortic segmentation was performed and aortic lengths, maximal diameters and volumes were measured from sino-tubular junction to the brachiocephalic trunk for the ascending aorta (AAo) and from the left subclavian artery to the diaphragm for the descending aorta (DAo). Results: While AAo D increased by 40% between APt and HC, AAo volume increased by 170%. Moreover, when comparing HT patients with controls, AAo volume difference was significant (p < 0.05) even after adjustment to BSA while AAo D was not. Conclusion: Aortic volumes measured automatically from 3D MRI were able to characterize subclinical and pathological dilation more accurately than maximal diameters.",60030857,Hopital Europeen Georges-Pompidou,Paris,France,['1700'],26.25,0.25055555555555553,0.5266666666666667,1
996,996,A Simulation Framework for the Rebalancing and Maintenance of Bicycle-sharing Systems,"Bicycle-sharing system (BSS) has attracted much attention due to its great success in providing a low-cost and environment-friendly alternative to traditional public transportation systems. In some BSSs comprised of stations with fixed docks, customer satisfaction can be measured by the availability of bikes for pick-ups and/or open docks for returns. However, it is quite common that the spatial balance of bike inventories will be broken due to customers' behavior or frequent failures of bikes and docks. As a result, constant rebalancing and maintenance services are required to sustain adequate levels of customer satisfaction. In this research, a simulation framework is developed to optimize the rebalancing and maintenance activities while satisfying customers' needs over a service area.

997,997,Computation of Mean Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity for the Assessment of Cerebral Autoregulation: Comparison of Different Strategies,"Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a complex mechanism stabilizing cerebral blood flow (CBF) against arterial pressure (AP) changes. CBF is commonly surrogated with the CBF velocity (CBFV) recorded via transcranial Doppler device from the middle cerebral artery. Most of the studies evaluating CA compute mean CBFV (MCBFV) on a beat-to-beat basis along with mean AP (MAP), but there is not a standard approach to derive MCBFV. In this study, we compare three different strategies to calculate MCBFV: i) between two consecutive diastolic points detected on the CBFV signal (MCBFVCBFV); ii) between two consecutive diastolic points detected on the AP signal (MCBFVAP); iii) between two consecutive R-wave peaks detected on the ECG (MCBFVECG). We analyzed ECG, noninvasive AP and CBFV signals recorded from 23 subjects (age: 28 ± 9 yrs, 13 female) at rest in supine position (REST) and during head-up tilt at 60° (TILT). While means were similar regardless of the considered strategy, variances significantly varied with MCBFVCBFV and MCBFVECG strategy producing the largest and the smallest variance respectively. This result stresses the need to standardize the approach for MCBFV computation to reduce the variability of the results solely due to the method adopted for its computation and favor clinical applications of CA assessment.",60108138,Ospedale Sacro Cuore Don Calabria,Verona,Italy,['1700'],29.0,-0.036538461538461534,0.407051282051282,1

This work aims to evaluate the accuracy of atrial propagation parameters obtained with OP-EGM in sinus rhythm (SR) and in different patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF).Real and simulated unipolar electrograms (u-EGMs) were used in this study. For both types of data, conduction velocity was obtained for each clique of 4 neighbour electrodes using OP-EGM. As a reference, conduction velocity was also computed from local activation times (LATs) using a linear propagation model.Analysis of simulated data showed that conduction velocity had good concordance with propagation patterns for both estimations, although the LAT-based errors were lower in most of the cases. When conduction velocity magnitude (CV) was 1 mm/ms, its estimation errors (expressed as mean ± std) calculated with OP-EGM and from LATs were 0.053 ± 0.005 mm/ms and 0.003 ±2.1 ×10-5 mm/ms, respectively, when focus was at 30 mm from the bottom of the tissue slice, while propagation direction angular errors were 6.64 ± 4.3°and 4.35 ± 2.8°.

It is a highly dynamic syndrome and therefore the early prediction of sepsis plays a key role in reducing its high associated mortality. However, this is a challenging task because there is no specific and accurate test or scoring system to perform early prediction. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for sepsis prediction. We also propose a new set of features to model the missingness in clinical data. The pipeline of the proposed method comprises three major components: feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. In total, 407 features are extracted from the clinical data. Then, five different sets of features are selected using a wrapper feature selection algorithm based on XGboost. The selected features are extracted from both valid and missing clinical data. Afterwards, an ensemble model consists of five XGboost models is used for sepsis prediction.

This research generated 864 different scenarios to capture various traffic dynamics under collective driving behavior of route selection. Factors such as vehicle arrival rate, behaviors at system boundary and traffic light phasing were considered.

A spacing buffer is used during instrument flight operations, when radar control is active. The buffer represents additional spacing between successive flights beyond what is required so that separation violations rarely, if ever, occur. In contrast, during non-radar visual operations, spacing at or near the minimum occurs when pilots request and are granted visual clearances. Using published data derived from multilateration surveillance systems, this study describes a simulation experiment created to understand the performance implications of actual separations for controlled flights when instrument flight rules are active. The results show, unsurprisingly, that there is a statistically meaningful increase in delays as the spacing buffer increases.

But signal processing is uneasy due to noise, inherent physiological variability and artifacts (e.g. respiratory amplitude modulation and body position shifts). We propose a new detection of heartbeats using a dynamic time warping (DTW) template matching method. A heartbeat template is automatically trained and the most similar potential heartbeats in the signal are classified as heartbeats.

A biophysically detailed mathematical model of the action potential of the rabbit atrial cells was developed based on experimental data recorded from rat right atrial cells. Conductance of Ito, IKur, IKr, IKs, IK1 as well as the time constant of Ito activation (τs) were modified to fit I-V curve of potassium current. Conductance, voltage dependent activation and inactivation of ICaL were modified to fit I-V, activation and inactivation curves of ICaL current. I-V, activation and inactivation curves of INa current were fitted similarly. The action potential from the computational model are comparable to the action potential (AP) recorded from rat atrial cells.

This study investigates the use of pulse oximeter parameters to determine the cardiovascular status of sleep apnea patients. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse photoplethysmography (PPG) features were extracted around SpO2 drops and averaged per patient. A random forest backwards wrapper was used to extract the feature set which could differentiate best between cardiovascular controls and patients who suffered from a cardiovascular event. A dataset of 975 patients was used for this study, 90 of them were used for training.The results show that sleep apnea patients with a cardiovascular comorbidity tend to have more severe oxygen desaturations, and often do not have a complete resaturation to their baseline SpO2.

One way to determine if major AF activation pathways originate at identified source is through causality analysis. This work assessed to what extent left atrial highest dominant frequency (HDF) areas can be identified as sources of activation pathways in 10 male subjects suffering from persistent AF. Virtual electrograms were collected from 64 endocardial locations for at least 5 minutes. Frequency and causality were analyzed on 4 s signal segments Causality was assessed using the directed transfer function (DTF) algorithm, and AF activation sources were identified as endocardial locations of which the VEGM signal had high influence on other VEGM signals.

The Cell-DEVS formalism is an extension to CA that can be used to build discrete-event cell spaces, improving their definition by making the timing specification more expressive. Different delay functions to specify the timing behavior of each cell, allowing the modeler to represent the timing complex behavior in a simple fashion.

Due to the fact that each channel has its own operating characteristics, the existing solutions developed for multi-skill call centers are not applicable to our problem. In this paper, we first build a high fidelity simulation model at a weekly level to evaluate various Quality of Service (QoS) measurements for a given schedule.

First, HTPB-AP interface level shock wave propagation is studied using the cohesive finite element method. The difference in the shock behavior of the analyzed HTPB-AP interfaces from that of the bulk AP and HTPB material is highlighted by numerical simulations of impacting a single AP particle in an HTPB-AP sample in three different ways: (1) a flyer plate is used to impact the whole HTPB-AP sample; (2) a flat impacter is used to impact the middle of AP particle embedded in HTPB matrix directly; and (3) a HTPB-AP interface is directly impacted with an impacter of radius 1 μm. Shock wave rise time at the interface is shown to differ for the three different impact modes. Based on the simulation results, a combined MRS and pulse laser-induced particle impact test is used for measuring shock viscosity at HTPB-AP interfaces. It is observed that by changing the chemical composition of the interface, shock viscosity can be altered. A modified finite element model with viscous stress based on shock viscosity values added to the stress equation is then used for the shock impact simulation of an HTPB-AP material system. A power law relation was obtained between shock wave rise time and the shock viscosity.",60033012,Naval Postgraduate School,Monterey,United States,['1706'],28.625,-0.008766233766233766,0.4066017316017316,1

Obtaining a ""good"" prior information in terms of training data, and how to use these data to estimate the prior parameters, are among of the primary challenges in statistical ECGI literature. This study investigates the effects of training set compositions, and prior parameter estimation methods on the ECGI accuracy. Two different training sets were used to determine the prior statistical parameters: 1) Beats that are all paced close to the test beat pacing site, 2) Beats with pacing sites covering a wider region around the test beat pacing site. These two training sets are obtained from a database of previously recorded epicardial potentials and used in maximum likelihood (ML)- and maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based prior estimation methods. The inverse problem is then solved by using the Kalman filter, based on those priors. Our results show that the Tikhonov regularization is the most fragile method to the measurement noise. MAPIF method is more robust to measurement noise in terms of electrogram reconstruction and activation time estimation accuracies, for both training sets. MLIF performed better with a more spread training set in terms of electrogram reconstruction accuracy, but showed better activation time reconstruction performance with the first training set.",60004305,Middle East Technical University (METU),Ankara,Turkey,['1700'],23.444444444444443,0.2435185185185185,0.3222222222222222,1

First, the mesoscale FDM theory of Acharya and Roy (2006 J. Mech. Phys. Solids 54 1687-710) is recalled which permits to express the set of equations under the form of a static problem, corresponding to the determination of the local stress field for a given dislocation density distribution, complemented by an evolution problem, corresponding to the transport of the dislocation density. The static problem is solved using FFT-based techniques (Brenner et al 2014 Phil. Mag. 94 1764-87). The main contribution of the present study is an efficient numerical scheme based on high resolution Godunov-type solvers to solve the evolution problem. Model problems of dislocation-mediated plasticity are finally considered in a simplified layer case. First, uncoupled problems with uniform velocity are considered, which permits to reproduce annihilation of dislocations and expansion of dislocation loops.

However, it is unclear yet if blocking IKur can increase the alternans susceptibility in normal atria.This study aimed to investigate the effect of blocking IKur on the genesis of AP alternans associated with arrhythmogenesis. The updated canine atrial cell model developed by Ramirez et al. was used to implement the dynamic pacing protocol and the standard S1-S2 protocol to obtain rate dependent curves and restitution curves of AP duration (APD) and Ca2+ transient which were further analyzed for the alternans susceptibility.Simulation results showed the prolonged AP and increased Ca2+ transient (CaT) by blocking IKur. IKur block from 40% to 80% produced long-short-long-short APD and Ca2+ transient alternans at pacing rate of ~ 2.3 Hz to 5 Hz. Further analysis showed that a possible mechanism for generating the observed alternans was due to the elevated plateau phase of AP by blocking IKur, which modulated APD and CaT via ICaL. Our findings demonstrate that blocking IKur may promote the genesis of APD and CaT alternans, implying a latent pro-arrhythmic effect in normal atria.",60138680,Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology,Qingdao,China,['1700'],27.428571428571427,0.029166666666666664,0.45138888888888884,1

The optimization combines an efficient heuristic mixed-integer optimization, followed by a customized Simulated Annealing algorithm. State-of-the-Art multi-objective solution techniques fail to address highly fluctuating demands in a suitable way. Due to the lack of modelling details, as well as dynamic constraints, these methods are unable to adapt to seasonal (off-) peaks in demand and to consider resource adjustments. Our approach features dynamic capacity and stock-level restrictions, which are evaluated by an integrated simulation module, as well as a statistical explorative data analysis. In addition to a smoothed production, mid-term stock levels, setup-costs and the expected utilization of downstream equipment are optimized simultaneously.

This study addressed this issue and developed a novel faster R convolutional neural network (CNN) model-based real-time QRS detection algorithm. Firstly, ECGs were segmented into 10-s length episodes, and each episode was transformed into a 2-D image with a pixel size of 200 X200 (VOC2007 format). Labelled QRS location information was used to generate the QRS bounding boxes. A faster R CNN model was constructed. Candidates of QRS bounding boxes were extracted by the region proposal networks (RPN). Then, the boxes with small probabilities were excluded according to the rules of probability distribution and QRS location relationship. Finally, locations of QRS complexes were determined based on the geometric features and threshold rule. The proposed algorithm was trained on the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database and verified on the 24-h wearable ECGs. Five-fold cross validation on 24-h wearable ECG recordings from 20 subjects generated a sensitivity of 98.76%, a positive predictivity of 98.52% and an accuracy of 97.32% compared to the manual annotations.

The task for GA is to produce envelopes the most similar to measured; then final timing reflects real activation of MS.Results: Presented model determined activation of left ventricular (LV) segments before right ventricular (RV) segments in all RBBB patients (mean 61.4 ± 13.7 ms) and activation of RV segments before the LV segments in all LBBB patients (mean 87.8 ± 15.8 ms).

Distinct noise frequencies in the power spectral density (PSD) were detected with a sliding window of variable width and subsequently removed by notch filtering. The absolute peak to peak voltage remaining in the inactive segments after baseline removal quantified the noise level of the system. An international, multi-center selection of 33 patients served as a broad sample cohort.The case-specific detection and removal of noise peaks reduced the noise level in unipolar EGMs by 30 % to 0.076 mV compared to standard clinical filtering. With a bipolar noise level of 0.01 mV, we saw that Rhythmia HDx meets the low noise floor claimed in the system specifications. Certain noise frequencies presented permanently in all cases whereas others showed up only intermittently or in individual cases.The suggested extension of filter settings lowers the noise level, enhances the detailed segmentation of low voltage areas, and encourages to exploit the advantages of unipolar over bipolar EGMs in clinical practice.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,['1700'],29.428571428571427,0.11947278911564625,0.4369472789115646,1

One of these mechanisms is the Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), i.e. an increased HR during inhalation and a decreased HR during exhalation. Different methods exist to quantify the RSA. A common approach is to calculate the power in the High Frequency (HF, 0.15 - 0.4 Hz) band of the spectrum of the HRV representation. More recently proposed methods use the respiratory signals to estimate the strength of the RSA.This paper studies the effect of the HRV representations on the quantification of the RSA. To this end, an experiment is used in which the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system are selectively blocked. Three different HRV representations are considered. Afterwards, the strength of the RSA is estimated using three approaches, namely the spectral content in the HF band of the HRV representations, orthogonal subspace projections and a time-frequency representation.The results suggest that the selection of an HRV representation does not have a significant impact on the RSA estimates in a healthy population.",60025063,KU Leuven,3000 Leuven,Belgium,['1700'],19.363636363636363,0.11125,0.5554166666666666,1
1044,1044,Multi-criteria-based Simulation Model to Estimate Resources for Bridge Inspections,"Bridges are important links in the US infrastructure system, and various inspection activities at different frequencies are needed to maintain and preserve bridges at an acceptable level of service. Recent guidelines by Federal highway administration (FHWA) have mandated state agencies to inspect and manage bridges at an element level. To obtain element-level inspection data, different resources are needed for mobilizing, cleaning, and accessing all elements of a bridge, creating complication in optimizing resource allocation for inspection activities. This study proposes a simulation-based, easy-to-use planning tool for bridge inspection to effectively estimate the minimum resources required to complete all the FHWA mandated inspections using four attributes (deck area, inspection frequency, structure type and scour critical) from bridge inventory database. The results of the simulation model can show resource utilization under different scenarios, which supports the planning of element-level bridge inspection to ensure optimum resource allocation.",60018319,"George Mason University, Fairfax Campus",Fairfax,United States,"['1712', '1706']",28.8,0.18,0.645,1
1045,1045,Robust Data-Driven Optimization Using Machine Learning and Monte-Carlo Simulation,"This paper presents a framework that was developed to achieve data-driven robust optimization of processes. The main idea is to automatically build a single and global predictive model using a machine learning technique (random forests), and then to use a derivative-free black-box optimization technique (MADS) to maximize a performance criterion. Monte-Carlo simulation is used to estimate pointwise prediction variance. This automated framework is designed to find optimal variance-stabilizing solutions while preserving the noisiness, non-smoothness, non-linearity, non-convexity and disjoint nature of real-life data. The time it takes to prepare the dataset depends on the volume of data, but this step occurs only once in the procedure. The time it takes to iterate during optimization depends on three user-specified quantities; therefore, the iterative portion is insensitive to data volume. Implementation was done using the R programming language which offers a wide variety of data processing, modelling and optimization capabilities.",124030570,Différence S.E.N.C.,Montreal,Canada,"['1712', '1706']",21.0,-0.0380952380952381,0.34345238095238095,1

Results of the experimental evaluation performed over a scenario with two agglomerates orbiting each other indicate that the Barnes-Hut allows accelerating the execution times over 10× compared to the occupied cells method.

1047,1047,Memristor Models for Early Detection of Sepsis in ICU Patients,"A supervised learning technique is used to carefully train memristor models to predict at an early stage whether a patient in intensive care unit (ICU) has the sepsis. A memristor behaves as a resistor, with a (mem)resistance that changes over time within a bounded interval. The resistance value depends on the full history of an applied voltage difference across the element, in the same way as the state of the brain depends on what a person has experienced in the past. The information contained in a voltage difference time series can be encoded in the resistance value. Clinical variables measured subsequently each hour since the patient's admittance in ICU are transformed into voltage difference signals with transformation functions. The training procedure involves the optimization of the transformation functions. The decision of whether to predict sepsis or not is taken by reading the value of the resistance.

The supply-demand imbalance at the regional level is stabilized by repositioning empty containers between inland depots. We propose an inter-depot empty container repositioning problem and a heuristic real-time decision algorithm to solve it. Initially, single-period travel time is considered and three models: Allocation Problem (AP), Value Approximation Model (SPL-VA), and Node Decomposition Heuristic (NDH-SP) are presented. The system is simulated over a certain time horizon by generating real-time supply and demand values, and the system's evolution is studied under each of the proposed models. The VA models perform better than the AP with modest computational effort. The NDH-SP is further generalized to accommodate multi-period travel times.

1049,1049,Early Prediction of Sepsis via SMOTE Upsampling and Mutual Information Based Downsampling,"Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection that can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death. The early prediction of sepsis is important, as it reduces undesirable patient outcomes associated with late-stage septic shock. However, effective early prediction is challenging, because the data is often heavily imbalanced against positive sepsis diagnosis. If the class imbalance is not addressed, models trained will tend to overfit in favour of the majority class, leading to degraded performance on the minority class. In this paper, we suggest a two-step method which consists of a mutual information based downsampling algorithm and a Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), in order to effectively perform early prediction of sepsis. Our team, Kent Ridge AI (ranked 77th), obtained a utility score of -0.164 on the full test set by using the proposed two-step method.

In this paper we propose a family of output-mean-with-respect-to-input-variance sensitivity measures and identify two particularly useful members of it.

SQT2 variant (linked to slow delayed rectifier, IKs) of SQTS, results from a gain-of-function (V307L) in the KCNQ1 subunit of the IKs channel. Pro-arrhythmogenic effects of SQT2 have been well characterized, but less is known about the pharmacological treatment of SQT2. We find that taurine-magnesium coordination compound (TMCC) exerted anti-arrhythmic effects with low toxicity. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the potential effects of TMCC on SQT2. The channel-blocking effect of TMCC on IKs in healthy and SQT2 cells were incorporated into computer models of human ventricular action potential (AP) and into one dimensional transmural tissue simulations. In the single-cell model, TMCC prolonged cell AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD90). In the one dimensional intact model, TMCC prolonged the QT interval on the pseudo-ECGs. Thus, the present study provides evidence that TMCC can extend the repolarization period and APD90 and QT interval, thereby representing a therapeutic candidate for arrhythmia in SQT2.",60031863,"Northeastern University, China",Shenyang,China,['1700'],19.88888888888889,0.006944444444444441,0.35555555555555557,1

Carotid-femoral pulse-wave transit time (cfTT) which reflects aortic compliance was assessed using the intersecting tangent algorithm at time-point of the maximal upstroke of the second derivative of the filtered pulse signal. Time-series of 256 heart cycles were used for analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) and cfTT variability analysis. Averaged power spectral density (aPSD) was estimated within selected frequency ranges by fast Fourier transform (FFT) approach. Magnitude squared coherence (MSC) between the both spectra was estimated. All volunteers exhibited variable temporal patterns of both HRV and cfTT variability. aPSD was reduced along with decreasing of time-window from 60 to 240 s.

With good magnetic field-dependent and magnetic-controlled electrical properties, magnetorheological gel (MRG) can be capsulated as a magneto-resistor to regulate the starting current in motor soft start-up. However, the inherent resistance of MRG magneto-resistor is too large to make current pass. In view of this, this paper improved the conductivity of MRG through doping carbon black (CB). The viscosity and magnetoresistance of MRG magneto-resistor under magnetic fields were studied systematically, and the conductive mechanism was qualitatively analyzed in this work. The results showed that the CB could significantly improve the magnetoresistance of MRG. The sample with 4 wt% CB was able to reduce the magnetoresistance more than 60% compared with sample with no CB. In addition, a soft start-up experimental system for motors had been established to verify the feasibility of MRG magneto-resistor. Verification test results showed that the rotating speed of a motor increased smoothly with the decrement of magnetoresistance.

One of the more technologically relevant material systems related to embrittlement is the Ni-S system where S has a deleterious effect on fracture behavior in polycrystalline Ni. In this work, we develop a Ni-S embedded-atom method (EAM) interatomic potential that accounts for the embrittling behavior of S at Ni GBs. Results using this new interatomic potential are then compared to previous density functional theory studies and a reactive force-field potential via a layer-by-layer segregation analysis. Our potential shows strong agreement with existing literature and performs well in predicting properties that are not included in the fitting database. Finally, we calculate embrittling potencies and segregation energies for six [100] symmetric-tilt GBs using the new EAM potential.

1072,1072,Building Chinese Legal Hybrid Knowledge Network,"Knowledge graphs play an important role in many applications, such as data integration, natural language understanding and semantic search. Recently, there has been some work on constructing legal knowledge graphs from legal judgments. However, they suffer from some problems. First, existing work follows the Western legal system, thus cannot be applied to other legal systems, such as Asian legal systems; Second, existing work intends to build a precise legal knowledge graph, which is often not effective, especially when constructing the precise relationship between legal terms. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework for constructing a legal hybrid knowledge network from Chinese encyclopedia and legal judgments. First, we construct a network of legal terms through encyclopedia data. Then, we build a legal knowledge graph through Chinese legal judgments which captures the strict logical connections in the legal judgments. Finally, we build a Chinese legal hybrid knowledge network by combining the network of legal terms and the legal knowledge graph. We also evaluate the algorithms which are used to build the legal hybrid knowledge network on a real-world dataset.

Airport operations have been extensively studied in the last decades ranging from airspace, airside and landside operations. Due to the nature of the system, simulation techniques have emerged as a powerful approach for dealing with the variability of these operations. However, in most of the studies, the different elements are studied in an individual fashion. The aim of this paper, is to overcome this limitation by presenting a methodological approach where airport operations are modeled together, such as airspace and airside. The contribution of this approach is that the resolution level for the different elements is similar therefore the interface issues between them is minimized. The framework can be used by practitioners for simulating complex systems like airspace-airside operations or multi-airport systems. The framework is illustrated by presenting a case study analyzed by the authors.",60103347,"Hogeschool van Amsterdam, University of Applied Sciences",Amsterdam,Netherlands,"['1712', '1706']",18.375,0.035416666666666666,0.4729166666666667,1

Motivated by the apparent advantages of GPU over CPU in many areas of science, we have developed a new Resonant Model (RM) of an AP of a biological cell amenable to parallel computing. In this study, we have investigated the potential performance benefits of the implementation of the RM on a GPU over the sequential execution on a CPU. In the proposed implementation, all threads in the same GPU warp share data using a warp-shuffle operation, which eliminates the access of global or shared memory. By exploiting the memory model and computational strengths of GPU, the obtained performance of the RM on the GPU is far superior to that of the CPU. On the GPU, the RM demonstrate linear or sub-linear growth in the execution times with the increase in the number of cells.

An electromechanical model of human ventricular cell model developed by Adeniran et al. has been modified by incorporating available experimental data from rat ventricular cells under Sham (control) and HP conditions. Hypertrophy was modeled by incorporating experimental data of changes in INa, Ito, INaCa, cell size and myofilament responses to Ca2+ in the cardiac cell.Simulations showed that HP produced:1) prolongation of the action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) by approximately 4.7%; 2) an increase of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) by 36%; 3) no marked change in the sarcomere length or the contractile force.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the performance of an AF detection model trained and tested on short measurements is generalizable to measurements in daily life. PPG, accelerometer, as well as reference ECG data were measured from 32 subjects (13 continuous AF, 19 no AF) in 24-hour monitoring in daily life. An AF detection model combining inter-pulse interval features was trained to classify AF or non-AF. Short measurements were obtained by selecting a 5-minute segment from each 24-hour recording and used for training the model. The accuracy was tested on both 5-minute segments and 24-hour data. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the model were 98.90%, 99.03%, and 98.98% with 5-minute data and 96.94%, 91.99%, and 93.91% with 24-hour data. False positive detections per patient worsened from being on average none during short recordings to (mean ± sd) 467 ± 328 in daily life.

The objective of this work is to explore the effect of heterogeneities present in the fibrotic tissue and their impact on the intracardiac electrogram (EGM). Human atrial myocyte and fibroblast electrophysiology was simulated using mathematical models proposed by Koivumäki et al. to represent electrical remodeling under peAF and the paracrine effect of the transforming grow factor βl (TGF-βl). 2D tissue simulations were computed varying the density of fibrosis (10%, 20% and 40%), myofibroblasts and collagen were randomly distributed with different ratios (0%-100%, 50%-50% and 100%- 0%). Results show that increasing the fibrosis density changes the re-entry dynamics from functional to anatomical due to a block in conduction in regions with high fibrosis density (40%). EGM morphology was affected by different ratios of myofibroblasts-collagen. For low myofibroblast densities (below 50%) the duration of active segments was shorter compared to higher myofibroblasts densities (above 50%).

Increased power of frequencies below 200 Hz in the diastole has been associated with CAD, and can be used to distinguish CAD from NonCAD patients. However, spectral roll off is steep (~40 dB/dec), and spectral leakage might mask the weak CAD-related signal.Methods: PCGs from 1168 subjects, 213 CAD and 955 NonCAD, were pooled from three studies. The average power spectral density (PSD) of diastole segments for NonCAD subjects was found, and an auto-regressive (AR) model of this PSD was constructed. The inverse of the corresponding filter was used for whitening.Results: A single iteration of whitening filtering was insufficient to make the PSD white for 5-1000 Hz. Two iterations of whitening filtering with an order of 6-10 were required to reach a plateau of maximal whitening with a spectral flatness measure close to 1 in the frequency band 5-1000 Hz.

To support the surgeon in this decision making, we present a novel approach to reconstruct the healthy shape of an aortic root based on ultrasound images of its pathologically dilated state using representation learning.The idea is to identify a suitable representation of healthy and pathological aortic root shapes using a supervised variational autoencoder. Then, an image of the dilated root can be encoded, manipulated in the latent space, i.e. shifted towards the distribution of healthy valves, and a synthetic image of this resulting shape can be generated using the decoder.We evaluate our method on an ex-vivo porcine data set and provide a proof-of-concept of our method in a qualitative and quantitavie way.

Measurements were obtained from five subjects after peripheral vascular surgery or endovascular interventions and compared to Holter recordings. The commercially available sensor Emfit QS as well an augmented version of the CLIE interval estimation algorithm were used. Using the proposed approach, an average relative beat-to-beat interval error of 3.8 % at a coverage of 61.5 % was achieved. Error and coverage were found to vary from subject to subject as well as time of day.

We developed an agent-based model (ABM) to identify and optimize direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy scale-up and treatment strategies for achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) goals of HCV elimination by the year 2030. While DAA is highly efficacious, it is also expensive, and therefore intervention strategies should balance the goals of elimination and the cost of the intervention.

1099,1099,Clustered Standard Deviation and Its Benefit to Identify Atrial Fibrillation,"Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a dysfunction of heart atriums shown as irregular heart activity leading to a higher risk of heart failure. Since AF may occur episodically, it is usually diagnosed using ECG Holter recordings. However, the presence of other pathologies and noise makes the automated processing of ECG Holter recordings complicated. Here, we present a new feature to distinguish AF from sinus rhythm as well as from other pathologies: Clustered Standard Deviation (CSTD).Method: QRS complexes are extracted from the ECG signal, and inter-beat intervals (RR) are ordered by their length. Then, RR clusters are found and the mean RR value is computed for each RR cluster. CSTD is computed using a formula for standard deviation using cluster-specific mean values instead of a global mean.Results: CSTD was evaluated for 7, 254 ECG segments from a private dataset (MDT company, Brno, Czechia), 60 seconds length, 1-lead, 250 Hz sampling frequency. CSTD showed high values for AF while remaining low for other pathologies and sinus rhythm. CSTD between AF and other classes showed AUC 0.95. For comparison, a standard deviation of RR intervals leads to AUC 0.65 due to its sensitivity to other pathologies. Test on public MIT-AFDB dataset shown AUC and AUPRC 0.98 and 0.97, respectively.",60017322,Institute of Scientific Instruments of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic,Brno,Czech Republic,['1700'],20.6,-0.08240447957839261,0.32657444005270087,1
1100,1100,Design and application of a text clustering algorithm based on parallelized k-means clustering," All rights reserved.The traditional text clustering algorithms face two common problems: the high dimensionality of computing vectors and poor calculation efficiency. To solve these problems, this paper explores deep into the K-means clustering (KMC), Hadoop and Spark big data technique, and then proposes a novel text clustering algorithm based on the KMC parallelized on big data platform. The propose algorithm is denoted as the SWCK-means. First, the Word2vec was adopted to calculate the weights of word vectors, and thus reduce the dimensionality of the massive text data. Next, the Canopy algorithm was introduced to cluster the weight data, and identify the initial cluster centers for the KMC. On this basis, the KMC was employed to cluster the preprocessed data. To improve the efficiency, a parallel design for the Canopy algorithm and the KMC was developed under the Spark architecture. The proposed algorithm was verified through experiments on a massive amount of online text data. The results show that our algorithm achieved more accurate classification effects than the traditional KMC, especially in handling a huge amount of data.",60087302,Inner Mongolia University of Technology,Hohhot,China,"['1712', '1702']",19.77777777777778,0.05842105263157895,0.4950877192982457,0

To further verify the accuracy of textile electrode based long-term wearable ECG analysis, a wearable ECG device was used to record 24-hours long-term ECGs simultaneously with a Holter monitor. Clinical parameters were derived from the wearable ECGs, and were compared with the reports from the Holter monitor. Specifically, ECG parameters of the measured total time, the beat number, the slowest heart rate, the mean heart rate, the fastest heart rate, the beat number of tachycardia, the beat number of bradycardias, Heart rate variability (HRV) parameters of SDNN, SDANN, RMSSD, PNN50, as well as the detection of premature atrial contraction (PAC) and premature ventricular contraction (PVC), were analysed and compared. Mean relative errors (MREs) of ECG parameters between the wearable ECG analysis and Holter report were all less than 10 % except the times of bradycardias (13.97 %). MREs for HRV parameters were all less than 14 %, and MREs for counting premature atrial contraction (PAC) and premature ventricular contraction (PVC) were 61.60 and 395.95 %, respectively.

As machine learning develops, there have been many approaches for prediction of sepsis using neural network-based models. In this work, We propose various methods including feature engineering, regularization technique, and train data sampling methods, which can boost the performance of the model. Our approach consist of three-component: a feature engineering, an auxiliary loss, and a manipulation of training distribution. In feature engineering, we employed a novel input imputation method that combines input decay, masking, and duration of missing and input transformation. As for regularization, we used the reconstruction error as the auxiliary loss. Meanwhile, we manipulated the distribution of training sample using normal point re-sampling and population-based sampling. On the validation set, our approach improved the performance of LSTM as AUROC/AUPRC of 0. 045/0.017, and the performance of transformer is enhanced AUROC/AUPRC of 0.034/0.024.

Results: The reconstructed activation times agreed closely with simulated values, with 50% to 70% of the nodes ≤ 1ms of absolute error. We found close agreement between the CVs calculated using reconstructed versus simulated activation times. Across the reconstructed stimulation sites we saw that the reconstructed CV was on average 3.8% different than the ground truth CV. Discussion: This study used simulated datasets to validate our methods for reconstructing 3D activation fronts and estimating conduction velocities.

Nevertheless, if inappropriate partitioning rules are used, lots of backtracking occur reducing largely the algorithm efficiency. A new partition-based random search method is developed in this paper. In the proposed method, all generated regions are stored for further partitioning and each region has a partition speed related to its posterior probability of being the most promising region. Promising regions have higher partition speeds while non-promising regions are partitioned slowly. The numerical results show that the proposed method finds the global optimum faster than the pure NP method if numerous high-quality local optima exist.

Six concentration combinations were simulated (cases 1 to 6). The gaseous air pollutants caused an APD shortening and loss of plateau phase of the action potential in a fraction that increases as the pollutant concentration increases.

Regions of stable high DF bordered regions offibrosis as determined by T1 Mapping MRI 82% of the time (p<0.05).Heterogeneous atrial remodeling, specifically fibrosis, arising from chronic AF may provide a substrate that anchors sites of high DF.

Therefore, this paper focuses on comparing different calculation methods, specifically, with regards to spatial distribution.Two voltage maps obtained in AF were used, removing points which did not meet the required specifications. The peaks for the remaining points, in regions of the left atrium, were then found and the voltage was calculated based on taking the peak to peak (p2p) for different beats.For around 30% of the points on the map, the voltage only changed by 0.1mV when taking one beat versus all beats. However, for some individual points, the difference was substantial, around 0.8mV, depending on the beat chosen. Additionally, the inter-method variability increased by around 0.1mV when considering all methods compared to only methods calculated using more than one point.It was found that taking the median over all p2p values in each point would be a more appropriate method for calculating the voltage.

Percentage contribution of U-shaped patterns to whole night-time series is small (in average 3%). However, the occurrence of U-shaped patterns affects to the properties of heart rate variability (HRV) significantly. The aim of this study is to evaluate its effect to nonlinear properties of HRV considering the ageing.Night-time 63 RR interval series from healthy subjects (26 males, 39 females, mean age: 40±14y) collected from the Institute of Cardiology and the Medical University of Gdańsk were analysed. Nonlinear properties of HRV were described by using DFA, Multiscale Multifractal Analysis (MMA) and Sample entropy.We found significant differences of Sample entropy (p<0.01) and DFA α2 (p<0.01) between the signals with a small (<=20, 32 pts) and a large (>20, 33 pts) number of U-shaped patterns. In turn, we observed significant difference of DFA α1 between the patients <39y (32 pts) and >=39y (33 pts) (p<0.01). We also found the U-shaped patterns as the factor modulating the values of scaling exponents for wide range of scales.The effect of the U-shaped patterns on HRV appears to be much stronger than expected judging by their total length compared to the length of the signal.",60085669,Instytut Kardiologii im.

1124,1124,Simulation Experiment Schemas -Beyond Tools and Simulation Approaches,"Simulation studies make use of various types of simulation experiments. For users, specifying these experiments is a demanding task since the specification depends on the experiment type and the idiosyncrasies of the used tools. Thus, we present an experiment generation procedure that guides users through the specification process, and abstracts away from the concrete execution environment. This abstraction is achieved by (1) developing schemas that define the properties of simulation experiments and dependencies between them, (2) specifying a mapping between schema properties and template fragments in the specification language of a target backend. We develop schema, template fragments, and mappings for stochastic discrete-event simulation, and show how the concepts can be transported to a different domain of modeling and simulation. Further, we expand the developed simple experiment schemas by a schema for experiment designs, and generate executable sensitivity analysis experiments, thereby demonstrating versatility and composability of our approach.",60003615,Universität Rostock,Rostock,Germany,"['1712', '1706']",24.666666666666668,0.03571428571428571,0.3653061224489796,1

For this purpose, a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer operating in single cantilever bending mode is employed. The equipment monitors the evolution of the force level to maintain constant the strain amplitude as cycling proceeds. Fatigue lives of as-received and welded NiTi wires are compared for different strain amplitudes applied during mechanical cycling.

In the first method, for each randomization, we compute an estimator of the cumulative distribution function (CDF), which is inverted to obtain a quantile estimator, and the overall quantile estimator is the sample average of the quantile estimators across randomizations. The second approach instead computes a single quantile estimator by inverting one CDF estimator across all randomizations. Because quantile estimators are generally biased, the first method leads to an estimator that does not converge to the true quantile as the number of randomizations goes to infinity. In contrast, the second estimator does, and we establish a central limit theorem for it. Numerical results further illustrate these points.",60030553,Universite de Rennes 1,Rennes,France,"['1712', '1706']",23.666666666666668,0.07637362637362638,0.293040293040293,1

A weighted sum method, which assigns different weights to each dispatching rule and prioritizes jobs with a high weighted sum, is widely used especially for LCD and semiconductor manufacturing. A suitable set of weights by considering dynamic system states has to be determined in order to improve the throughput and utilization of systems. Hence, we develop a sequential search framework, with simulation and decision trees, which can generate a good weight set of dispatching rules within a short period of time.

The public-domain Sequest software now includes both procedures. The software is applied to a user-supplied dataset exhibiting warm-up effects, autocorrelation, and a multimodal marginal distribution.

1133,1133,Mitigating Customers' Downsell Risk for Single-Leg Revenue Management with Demand Dependencies,"With increased complexity of customers choice behaviors, practical optimization approaches often involve decomposing a network revenue management problem into multiple single-leg problems. While dynamic programming approaches can be used to solve single-leg problems exactly, they are not scalable and require precise information about the customers' arrival rates. On the other hand, the traditional heuristics are often static which do not explicitly consider the remaining time horizon in the optimization. This motivates us to find scalable and efficient dynamic heuristics that work well with the complex customers choice models. We develop two expected marginal seat revenue type heuristics for the single-leg dynamic revenue management problems in airline industry and evaluate its performances using Monte Carlo simulation. The initial simulation results indicate that our proposed heuristics are computationally efficient and fairly robust.

To do so, this paper describes a preliminary study in which a novel ECG-based estimator of the standard deviation of ventricular myocytes' repolarization times (sθv ) called the V-index was computed in simulated data, assessing whether the presence of f-waves may corrupt the V-index. The analysis was performed in simulated ECGs generated by combining synthetic bundles of 300 T-waves with seven different values of sθv, with QRS template and 50 f-waves extracted from real data. The results show a strong correlation between the calculated target V-index (tV-index) and the sθv (r = 0.99, p-value < 0.001). They also show the effect of the f-waves in the computation of the V-index. The V-index calculated with f-waves (fV-index) and after the f-waves were removed (cV-index) had highly significant differences (p-value < 0.001) and significant differences (p-value < 0.05) with the tV-index for values below 53.3 ms, which proves the corruptive effect the f-waves have on the computation of the V-index and stresses the importance of removing them before attempting further analysis.",60070760,"Medtronic Bakken Research Center, Maastricht",Maastricht,Netherlands,['1700'],33.833333333333336,0.10757575757575757,0.4803030303030303,1

Demands for each customer class are generated by independent Poisson processes while the processing times are deterministic. All customers in the same class have the same demand lead time (the difference between the due date and the requested date) and back-ordering costs. Each stage in the inventory system follows order-base-stock-policies where the replenishment order is issued upon arrival of a customer order. The problem requires a fast and reliable method that determines the system performance under different policies and ADI. Thus, we employ discrete event simulation to obtain output parameters such as inventory costs, fill rates, waiting time, and order allocation times. A numerical analysis is conducted to identify a reasonable policy to use in this type of system.",60032882,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Eindhoven,Netherlands,"['1712', '1706']",20.714285714285715,0.1275,0.465,1

It leads the activation of the cardiac action potentials and its dysfunction may leads to many severe pathologies. However, the currently widely used FSC model is not developed for mouse, and relatively outdated compared with the emerging experimental data on mouse atria, making the model less reliable in investigating the mechanisms underlying atrial arrhythmias. In this work, we intend to develop a new model for the mouse atrial FSC which can reproduce the newly published experimental data. The kinetics of and the current generated by our new model were thoroughly validated. We investigated the response of the new model to infra- or supra-threshold stimuli and found that it needs a smaller stimulus to be activated and has a higher driving ability compared with the old model. The current amplitude of the new model also shows a smoother stimulus-dependent curve than the old model.

The other is realized in an external domain-specific language ML3, based on a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) semantics. By developing models in pairs in different approaches, important properties of the target model can be more effectively revealed.

A population study of the angle of entry at the interatrial septum relative to the appendage can assist in both catheter design and patient-specific implant choice. In our population study, we analyzed the inherent clusters of the angles that were obtained between the septum normal and the LAA ostium plane. The number of inherent angle clusters matched the LAA four morphological classifications reported in the literature. Further, our exploratory analysis revealed that the normal from the ostium plane does not intersect the septum in all the samples under study.

1146,1146,Towards Detailed Real-Time Simulations of Cardiac Arrhythmia,"Recent advances in personalized arrhythmia risk prediction show that computational models can provide not only safer but also more accurate results than invasive procedures. However, biophysically accurate simulations require solving linear systems over fine meshes and time resolutions, which can take hours or even days. This limits the use of such simulations in the clinic where diagnosis and treatment planning can be time sensitive, even if it is just for the reason of operation schedules. Furthermore, the non-interactive, non-intuitive way of accessing simulations and their results makes it hard to study these collaboratively. Overcoming these limitations requires speeding up computations from hours to seconds, which requires a massive increase in computational capabilities.Fortunately, the cost of computing has fallen dramatically in the past decade. A prominent reason for this is the recent introduction of manycore processors such as GPUs, which by now power the majority of the world's leading supercomputers. These devices owe their success to the fact that they are optimized for massively parallel workloads, such as applying similar ODE kernel computations to millions of mesh elements in scientific computing applications. Unlike CPUs, which are typically optimized for sequential performance, this allows GPU architectures to dedicate more transistors to performing computations, thereby increasing parallel speed and energy efficiency.",60010348,Universitetet i Oslo,Oslo,Norway,['1700'],26.0,0.11468253968253968,0.4932539682539683,1

In terms of daily fluctuation pattern, the horizontal measurement error and indoor air temperature are in satisfactory consistency, while the vertical measurement error are not. In terms of overall trend, the vertical measurement error is highly correlated with indoor air temperature, having a positive linear relationship between them.

A rule-based algorithm (RBA) for detecting vital signs instabilities was developed; we did so in the expectation of enhancing clinician trust compared to black box approaches such as deep neural networks. Two PICU physicians provided expert classifications for episodes indicative of vital signs instability or their absence. The RBA's best result generated 91.6% correct, 6% false negatives, and 3% false positives on the test data (n=29) showing promise for eventual application in a clinical setting. Future research is needed to refine the algorithm and implement it in clinical practice.",60012408,Universität zu Lübeck,Lübeck,Germany,['1700'],19.875,-0.006458333333333349,0.2879166666666666,1

This work is performed in the context of the EU-funded HiDALGO Centre of Excellence, where we seek to establish more scalable and accurate models for migration prediction. Such a hybrid simulation approach is necessary as we need to understand how conflicts may evolve if we are to forecast the escape of people from future conflicts. To accomplish this, we couple a new model for conflict propagation with existing forced migration models. We explore the implications of our setup by studying the effect of different conflict progressions on the forced displacement of people, using an established model of the Mali 2012 conflict. We conclude that accurately predicting conflict evolutions is a key determinant in the outcomes of forced migration simulations, particularly if such forecasts are made over longer periods.",60020623,Brunel University London,Uxbridge,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1706']",24.833333333333332,-0.03522727272727273,0.4841382575757576,1

A continuous blood pressure signal was collected during a 30-minute stimulation period and a 10-minute recovery period using a Finometer device (Finapress Medical System, the Netherlands). LabChart (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA) was used to process and compute blood pressure responses.A significantly greater reduction of systolic blood pressure values during stimulation was observed in the 100 Hz session compared to sham (p=0.02). In addition, significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure (p=0.04) and mean arterial pressure (p=0.04) values were observed during RAVANS stimulation compared to baseline during the 100 Hz session.

Interstitial collagen deposits remodel myocardium, causing disruption of electrical propagation between the endocardial and the epicardial layers, and affecting propagation within layers as well. How these changes manifest on the electrogram (EGM) is unclear. Here we investigate the consequences of epicardium- endocardium electrical dissociation on EGMs. Left atrial patient-specific bilayer computational models were constructed using MRI from AF patients (n = 11). Interstitial collagen was incorporated as microstructural discontinuities within layers and causing transmural dissociation in the high-fibrosis areas. The models where the fibrosis was not included were considered as controls. Changes in the unipolar EGM characteristics were computed. A propagation delay was observed between both layers. No monotonic linear relationship between control and fibrotic EGMs was found. With the collagen deposits, amplitude decreases and increased fractionation on EGMs were significant. EGM area also tended to become smaller, and duration and waveform asymmetry were affected. In conclusion, measurements of EGM morphology can be used together with clinical imaging data to distinguish between different substrate modifications, and better select ablation targets.",60102125,Université de Bordeaux,Bordeaux,France,['1700'],13.692307692307692,0.175,0.495,1

Multi-parameter Fusion Analysis (MPA) is a technique often used to address this. However, it cannot be used in some cases such as in severe peripheral circulation disorder, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) etc.. In these cases, critical alarms may be erroneously suppressed if MPA is applied increasing clinical risk for subjects.Electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethesmogram (PPG) signals are normally synchronous. Based on this, our method evaluates the applicability of MPA as follows: Multiple physiological signals are first analyzed by highly reliable single-parameter analysis methods to obtain all the parameters from these as well as signal quality indices. Then, signal features of different channels for each cardiac cycle are grouped. Finally, group features are derived and used with an integrated decision tree to determine the applicability of MPA. Three databases were used to test algorithm performance. DB1 containing 200 clinical waveform records; DB2 with 100 clinical waveform records; DB3 comprising 30 cases recorded in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, each case spanning 2 hours.

Some simulation tools offer geographical data for modeling actual roads. However, in order to model time-dependent transport times, additional data are needed. In this paper, we present an approach to tackle this problem. Road networks are derived from OpenStreetMap data (including traffic signals).

1163,1163,Automatic Body Measurement by Neural Networks,"Size prediction and garment customization are two main goals of body measurement for garment design. Traditional body measurement, involving manual measurement and trying clothes in person, is time-consuming and not cost-efficient. With the help of 3D body scanner and neural networks, body measurement can be fast and accurate, thus reducing the cost. This paper introduces neural network models to predict body sizes and the measurements used to customize clothes from various body data. Three kinds of input data are used: raw 3D point clouds of human bodies, key body locations, and estimated body measurements. Raw point clouds are collected by scanning the participants body, and key body locations and estimated measurements are automatically computed by existing software based on the point clouds. Then the manual measurement is applied to the participants to obtain the size labels and useful measurements for garment customization, which are used as the ground-Truth values of output data. Different network structures are utilized for different kinds of input data. The results show that neural networks can achieve decent performance in predicting measurements for making clothes. While the results of the three models are comparable, the feed-forward network model with estimated measurements achieves the best result in numerical measurement prediction. In terms of size label prediction, the models using estimated measurements achieve similar results, while the CNN model with key body locations and the simplified PointNet model applied on raw point clouds are unable to achieve high accuracy. The initial attempts show the potential of using networks for body measurement.

The resulting lookahead contraction policies are analyzed both with the minimal number of lookahead steps required for obtaining informative value factors, and with fixed number of lookahead steps. We show that lookahead contraction reduces the minimal number of required lookahead steps, and that contraction guarantees finiteness of the minimal lookahead. For minimal lookahead we demonstrate empirically that lookahead contraction never leads to worse performance, and that lookahead contraction policies based on expected value of improvement perform best. For fixed lookahead, we show that all lookahead contraction policies eventually outperform their counterparts without contraction, and that contraction results in a performance boost for policies based on predictive probability of improvement.",60000401,Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster,Munster,Germany,"['1712', '1706']",24.0,0.039999999999999994,0.42000000000000004,1

The aim of this study was the design, development and test of different LA motion fields in AF on a patient-specific 3D anatomical model to clarify the influence of contraction models on LA hemodynamics. Since LA motion field is not available from clinical data during AF, three displacement models were designed to simulate the irregular, disorganized, very rapid and strongly reduced LA contraction, a random model, a discrete random model and a con-tinuous sinusoidal model. Blood velocity fields, kinetic energy, vortex structures and blood stasis were analyzed in both SR and AF conditions in the LA. Velocities in SR were higher than in AF, particular-ly during atrial systole. The three AF models resulted in different wash-out velocities both at the mitral valve and at the ostium of the LA appendage. Vortices were also differently distributed inside the LA showing a more organized flow in the sinusoidal model which was also characterized by the lowest blood stasis (8.6%) inside the LA appendage.

However, the literature contains differing opinions about how boundary conditions (BCs) should be applied. In the proposed study, we investigate two sets of BCs, found in the literature, using synthetic motion vector fields: (i) zero BCs for all nodes along the domain boundary; (ii) a single zero BC for the first node. We found that (i) produces a decomposition with Normalised Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) below 1%, while (ii) produces NRMSE greater than 200% when the input field contains a harmonic component.

Using different MIT-BIH databases, 27955, 3363 and 76 images were generated for NSR, AF and AB respectively using a 2-minute window with 50 % overlap. The 80 % of the data available for each rhythm was used to create a reference rhythm image atlas. The remaining 20 % was classified into one of the three categories using mutual information. The process was iterated 10 times, in which images used to construct the atlas and used to create the test set were randomly selected. AF was correctly classified 94.12 % ± 0.45, AB 72.00 % ± 11.24 and NSR 80.70 %±0.54.

The three studied models generated different arrhythmic patterns, with the appearance of re-entrant drivers at different atrial regions.We conclude that it is very important to use complete realistic atrial models, especially for atrial fibrillation studies, to obtain reliable results.

Although AF-induced remodelling may impair SAN function, ionic mechanisms underlying sinus node dysfunction (SND) remain unclear. Here, this study investigated mechanisms by which AF-induced electrical remodelling promotes and perpetuates SND through biophysically detailed computer modelling. The recent Fabbri et al. model of human SAN cell and our mathematical model for human atrial cell action potential were modified to incorporate various experimental data on AF-induced changes in ionic channel currents and intracellular calcium handling. In our simulations, AF-induced electrical remodelling abbreviated atrial action potential duration (APD) and lowered heart rates. APD abbreviation can be mainly attributed to reduced ICaL and increased potassium currents (IKs and IK1). Down-regulation of If prolonged cycle length and thereby influenced the function of voltage clock in human SAN cells. Altogether, our simulated results indicate that voltage clock malfunction might be one mechanism underlying AF-induced SND and our SND mathematical model can be a useful in the design of experiments and the development of drugs.",60112777,"Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland",Auckland,New Zealand,['1700'],20.0,0.06830065359477124,0.33366013071895423,1

It is rare to study the classification of the entire ECG records. In fact, these two issues are completely different, record level classification is more difficult than beat level classification. In this paper, we propose a record level ECG classification method by combining 1-D deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM). The proposed method utilizes CNN to automatic extract features of ECG patches without complex data pre-processing or artificial feature scheme, and then utilizes two layers LSTM to model the underlying temporal correlation relation among ECG patches. In order to alleviate vanishing gradient problem and enhance representation power of features, we combine residual connection and attention mechanisms to build a residual attention module.

On a trail, the average velocity of ants remains approximately constant irrespective of density, thereby avoiding jamming. Assuming chemotaxis, we analyze platoon-related scenarios to assess the marching-platoon hypothesis, which claims that ants on a trail form a single platoon in which they march synchronously, thereby reducing hindrances due to increasing density. Contrary to that hypothesis, our findings show that ants on a trail do not march synchronously and do experience stop-and-go motion. However, more interestingly, our study also indicates that the ants' chemotaxis behavior leads to a peculiar jam absorption mechanism, which helps to maintain free flow on a trail and avoids jamming. Again, contrary to the marching-platoon hypothesis, our findings also indicate that, rather than assisting traffic flow, forming a single cluster actually triggers jamming.",60025997,Keio University,Tokyo,Japan,['1706'],25.833333333333332,0.1482142857142857,0.3936904761904762,1

Modular robots consist of many modules that can be configured into various structures, and motion planning problem for modular robots with many degrees of freedom and many motion constraints is a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm for modular robots to handle this problem with huge state space inspired by DNA replication process - The topology of DNA can be changed by cutting and resealing strands as tanglements form. In a variable topology truss, a single node with enough edge modules can split into a pair of nodes and two separate nodes can be merged to become an individual one. This self-reconfiguration ability results in more potential applications for this type of robots in unstructured environment, such as space and underseas but also leads to more challenges for reconfiguration planning. A novel way to model the robot in a nonuniform grid space is presented and a simple local planner is also developed to check the validation of possible actions.

One solution is to retrieve images with known pose from a database for the localization of query images. However, in environments with drastically varying conditions (e.g. illumination changes, seasons, occlusion, dynamic objects), retrieval-based localization is severely hampered and becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, a novel domain-invariant feature learning method (DIFL) is proposed based on ComboGAN, a multi-domain image translation network architecture. By introducing a feature consistency loss (FCL) between the encoded features of the original image and translated image in another domain, we are able to train the encoders to generate domain-invariant features in a self-supervised manner. To retrieve a target image from the database, the query image is first encoded using the encoder belonging to the query domain to obtain a domain-invariant feature vector. We then preform retrieval by selecting the database image with the most similar domain-invariant feature vector. We validate the proposed approach on the CMU-Seasons dataset, where we outperform state-of-the-art learning-based descriptors in retrieval-based localization for high and medium precision scenarios.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.88888888888889,0.2440909090909091,0.5468181818181819,1
1192,1192,DeepLocNet: Deep Observation Classification and Ranging Bias Regression for Radio Positioning Systems,"WiFi technology has been used pervasively in fine-grained indoor localization, gesture recognition, and adaptive communication. Achieving better performance in these tasks generally boils down to differentiating Line-Of-Sight (LOS) from Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signal propagation reliably which generally requires expensive/specialized hardware due to the complex nature of indoor environments. Hence, the development of low-cost accurate positioning systems that exploit available infrastructure is not entirely solved. In this paper, we develop a framework for indoor localization and tracking of ubiquitous mobile devices such as smartphones using on-board sensors. We present a novel deep LOS/NLOS classifier which uses the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and can classify the input signal with an accuracy of 85%. The proposed algorithm can globally localize and track a smartphone (or robot) with a priori unknown location, and with a semi-accurate prior map (error within 0.8m) of the WiFi Access Points (AP). Through simultaneously solving for the trajectory and the map of access points, we recover a trajectory of the device and corrected locations for the access points.

It does not require ground truth data for 3D shapes and the viewpoints. Because it relies on such a weak form of supervision, our approach can easily be applied to real-world data. We demonstrate that our method produces reasonable qualitative and quantitative results on natural images for both shape estimation and viewpoint prediction.

1194,1194,Resilience by Reconfiguration: Exploiting Heterogeneity in Robot Teams,"We propose a method to maintain high resource availability in a networked heterogeneous multi-robot system subject to resource failures. In our model, resources such as sensing and computation are available on robots. The robots are engaged in a joint task using these pooled resources. When a resource on a particular robot becomes unavailable (e.g., a sensor ceases to function), the system automatically reconfigures so that the robot continues to have access to this resource by communicating with other robots. Specifically, we consider the problem of selecting edges to be modified in the system's communication graph after a resource failure has occurred. We define a metric that allows us to characterize the quality of the resource distribution in the network represented by the communication graph. Upon a resource becoming unavailable due to failure, we reconFigure the network so that the resource distribution is brought as close to the maximal resource distribution as possible without a large change in the number of active inter-robot communication links. Our approach uses mixed integer semi-definite programming to achieve this goal. We employ a simulated annealing method to compute a spatial formation that satisfies the inter-robot distances imposed by the topology, along with other constraints. Our method can compute a communication topology, spatial formation, and formation change motion planning in a few seconds.

Therefore, the issue of how to efficiently control these vehicles arises, because autonomous agents need to be coordinated and not controlled, to give autonomous behaviors and actions space. The scientific contribution of this paper is a novel approach, based on prioritized planning to target this issue as well as an open source framework for evaluation and comparison. Prioritized planning has the disadvantage of being neither optimal nor complete, however, it has the advantage of being computationally feasible. This work utilizes prioritized planning to significantly increase the set of feasible scenarios through collision prevention: by locally finding alternative routes and adding them to the search graph. The paper clearly formulates the extensions needed and delineates the approach's limits, as it is neither optimal nor complete. More importantly, however, our method calculates routes for each vehicle with inter-vehicle synchronization, enabling vehicles to execute the plan in a distributed fashion without centralized control, thereby allowing autonomous behavior.

However, current visual localization methods still struggle with environmental changes across weathers and seasons, as there is significant appearance variation between the map and the query image. The crucial challenge in this situation is that the percentage of outliers, i.e. incorrect feature matches, is high. In this paper, we derive minimal closed form solutions for 3D-2D localization with the aid of inertial measurements, using only 2 point matches or 1 point match and 1 line match. These solutions are further utilized in the proposed 2-entity RANSAC, which is more robust to outliers as both line and point features can be used simultaneously and the number of matches required for pose calculation is reduced. Furthermore, we introduce three feature sampling strategies with different advantages, enabling an automatic selection mechanism. With the mechanism, our 2-entity RANSAC can be adaptive to the environments with different distribution of feature types in different segments.

1198,1198,"CALC2.0: Combining Appearance, Semantic and Geometric Information for Robust and Efficient Visual Loop Closure","Traditional attempts for loop closure detection typically use hand-crafted features, relying on geometric and visual information only, whereas more modern approaches tend to use semantic, appearance or geometric features extracted from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While these approaches are successful in many applications, they do not utilize all of the information that a monocular image provides, and many of them, particularly the deep-learning based methods, require user-chosen thresholding to actually close loops - which may impact generality in practical applications. In this work, we address these issues by extracting all three modes of information from a custom deep CNN trained specifically for the task of place recognition. Our network is built upon a combination of a semantic segmentator, Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and triplet embedding network. The network is trained to construct a global feature space to describe both the visual appearance and semantic layout of an image. Then local keypoints are extracted from maximally-activated regions of low-level convolutional feature maps, and keypoint descriptors are extracted from these feature maps in a novel way that incorporates ideas from successful hand-crafted features. These keypoints are matched globally for loop closure candidates, and then used as a final geometric check to refute false positives. As a result, the proposed loop closure detection system requires no touchy thresholding, and is highly robust to false positives - achieving better precision-recall curves than the state-of-the-art NetVLAD, and with real-time speeds.",60023004,University of Delaware,Newark,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",29.375,0.13304347826086957,0.4531884057971014,1

The sampled stress distribution is mapped to output forces f-{x}, f-{y}, and f-{\mathrm{z}} and two contact angles, \theta and \psi on the hemispherical sensor surface via Gaussian process regression. The prototype sensor is able track normal and shear forces accurately, achieving a normalized root mean (RMS) squared error of only 1.00%-1.36% for f-{\mathrm{z}} across multiple tests with up to 180N normal force, and a normalized RMS error of 1.71%-4.67% and 1.82%-6.68% for fx and fy, respectively, with up to 80N shear force. Additionally, the footpad is able to estimate the contact location coordinates \theta and \psi with a normalized RMS error of 2.69%-7.51% over a range of 0-40{\mathrm{o}} and 2.79%-9.62% over a range of 0-30{\mathrm{o}}, respectively. The footpad can estimate contact location over a maximum range of \theta=\pm 45{0} and \psi=\pm 45{\mathrm{o}}, and can withstand over 450N of normal force at location \theta =\psi =0{\mathrm{o}} without reaching saturation. This prototype demonstrates the ability to simultaneously measure force in three axes and contact angles using Gaussian process regression, with the potential to explore other regression methods for embedded computing and miniaturization of the design for finger tip scale sensors.",60022195,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",31.555555555555557,0.10283816425120772,0.4972135955831608,1

1203,1203,Deep Lagrangian Networks for end-to-end learning of energy-based control for under-actuated systems,"Applying Deep Learning to control has a lot of potential for enabling the intelligent design of robot control laws. Unfortunately common deep learning approaches to control, such as deep reinforcement learning, require an unrealistic amount of interaction with the real system, do not yield any performance guarantees, and do not make good use of extensive insights from control theory. In particular, common black-box approaches - that abandon all insight from control - are not suitable for complex robot systems.We propose a deep control approach as a bridge between the solid theoretical foundations of energy-based control and the flexibility of deep learning. To accomplish this goal, we extend Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) to not only adhere to Lagrangian Mechanics but also ensure conservation of energy and passivity of the learned representation. This novel extension is embedded within a energy control law to control under-actuated systems. The resulting DeLaN for energy control (DeLaN 4EC) is the first model learning approach using generic function approximation that is capable of learning energy control because existing approaches cannot learn the system energies directly. DeLaN 4EC exhibits excellent real-time control on the physical Furuta pendulum and learns to swing-up the pendulum while the control law using system identification does not.",60072208,"ABB Corporate Research, Heidelberg",Heidelberg,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",29.142857142857142,0.06450617283950617,0.48121693121693127,1

With the increasing challenges in planetary exploration, equipping planetary rovers with the principles of terramechanics is becoming more and more common, especially on rough or intricate terrain. However, it is difficult for conventional maps with elevation information only to reflect terrain mechanical properties, which play important roles in terramechanics-based simulation or motion control. This study extracts the dominant parameters in terrain bearing and shearing models, and presents a multi-layered grid map with fundamental geometric and mechanical elements.

In this paper, a robotic grasp detection algorithm named ROI-GD is proposed to provide a feasible solution to this problem based on Region of Interest (ROI), which is the region proposal for objects. ROI-GD uses features from ROIs to detect grasps instead of the whole scene. It has two stages: the first stage is to provide ROIs in the input image and the second-stage is the grasp detector based on ROI features. We also contribute a multi-object grasp dataset, (a) which is much larger than Cornell Grasp Dataset, by labeling Visual Manipulation Relationship Dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ROI-GD performs much better in object overlapping scenes and at the meantime, remains comparable with state-of-the-art grasp detection algorithms on Cornell Grasp Dataset and Jacquard Dataset.

Therefore, it has become common practice to use available synthetic samples along domain adaptation schemes to prepare algorithms for the target domain. Tackling this problem from a different angle, we introduce a pipeline to map unseen target samples into the synthetic domain used to train task-specific methods. Denoising the data and retaining only the features these recognition algorithms are familiar with, our solution greatly improves their performance. As this mapping is easier to learn than the opposite one (i.e., to generate realistic features to augment the source samples), we demonstrate how our whole solution can be trained purely on augmented synthetic data and still performs better than methods trained with domain-relevant information (e.g., real images or realistic textures for the 3D models).

1212,1212,Structured Reward Shaping using Signal Temporal Logic specifications,"Deep reinforcement learning has become a popular technique to train autonomous agents to learn control policies that enable them to accomplish complex tasks in uncertain environments. A key component of an RL algorithm is the definition of a reward function that maps each state and an action that can be taken in that state to some real-valued reward. Typically, reward functions informally capture an implicit (albeit vague) specification on the desired behavior of the agent. In this paper, we propose the use of the logical formalism of Signal Temporal Logic(STL) as a formal specification for the desired behaviors of the agent. Furthermore, we propose algorithms to locally shape rewards in each state with the goal of satisfying the high-level STL specification. We demonstrate our technique on two case studies, a cart-pole balancing problem with a discrete action space, and controlling the actuation of a simulated quadrotor for point-to-point movement.The proposed framework is agnostic to any specific RL algorithm, as locally shaped rewards can be easily used in concert with any deep RL algorithm.",60029311,University of Southern California,Los Angeles,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.833333333333332,0.08854166666666666,0.4505208333333333,1

However, even with current state-of-the-art algorithms and computational resources, these methods are still plagued with high sample complexity, and thus long training times, especially for high degree of freedom (DOF) systems. There are also concerns arising from lack of perceived stability or robustness from emerging policies. This paper aims at mitigating these drawbacks by: (1) modeling a complex, high DOF system with a representative simple one, (2) making explicit use of forward and inverse kinematics without forcing the RL algorithm to 'learn' them on its own, and (3) learning locomotion policies in Cartesian space instead of joint space. In this paper, these methods are applied to JPL's Robosimian, but they can be readily used on any system with a base and end effector(s). These locomotion policies can be produced in just a few minutes, trained on a single laptop.

1214,1214,Computer Generated Environment Utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms to Evaluate Dementia Patients," Published by Elsevier B.V.As age progresses, people are exposed to more diseases, one of the most important diseases is dementia. Dementia's is a difficult disease to diagnose. Most medical diagnoses are based on the pen- paper cognitive test or high-cost medical devices such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Accordingly, there is an increasing need for using computerized methods in the diagnosis of dementia's disease to fully utilize the advantages provided by advanced technologies. Cognitive testing[1][2] is one of the most accurate tests when it comes to dementia's detection. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages related to it, including the measurement of the extent of the brain damage, the adaptability with the intelligence of the patient (IQ) and assessment that reflects real-world conditions and daily tasks[3]. Hence, it was advisable to explore the newer, more effective applications that adopting the cognitive methods with computerized methods. One of the methods is based on Virtual Environments which are given additional pros to cognitive test and allow patients to immerse in a controlled environment[4, 5]. This paper proposed a non-invasive, cognitive computerized test for diagnosis of dementia's in earlier stages based on 3D virtual environments platform combined with Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA). This test evaluates three cognitive domains: visuospatial assessment, memory assessment, and executive function.

Compared to Kalman filters, Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are less constrained in regard to state propagation and update model definition, which makes it easier to implement any suitable problem. In this work, we present a generic Sequential Monte Carlo framework, which uses abstract formulations for importance weighting, propagation and resampling and provides an independent core algorithm that is usable for any problem instantiation, such that diverse SMC problems can be implemented easily and quickly, since the basic algorithms are already provided. Current applications include 2D localization, 2D tracking in a SLAM system and contact point localization on a manipulator surface. Further, we introduce concepts to deal with data input synchronization and fair execution of different weighting models, which makes it possible to incorporate data from as many update sources, e.g. sensors, as desired. As a typical application scenario, we provide a plugin-based and hence easily extensible instantiation for 2D localization and demonstrate the capabilities of our framework and methods based on a well-known dataset.",60017246,Universität Tübingen,Tubingen,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.375,0.1453703703703704,0.45879629629629626,1
1217,1217,A Robust Extrinsic Calibration Framework for Vehicles with Unscaled Sensors,"Accurate extrinsic sensor calibration is essential for both autonomous vehicles and robots. Traditionally this is an involved process requiring calibration targets, known fiducial markers and is generally performed in a lab. Moreover, even a small change in the sensor layout requires recalibration. With the anticipated arrival of consumer autonomous vehicles, there is demand for a system which can do this automatically, after deployment and without specialist human expertise.To solve these limitations, we propose a flexible framework which can estimate extrinsic parameters without an explicit calibration stage, even for sensors with unknown scale. Our first contribution builds upon standard hand-eye calibration by jointly recovering scale. Our second contribution is that our system is made robust to imperfect and degenerate sensor data, by collecting independent sets of poses and automatically selecting those which are most ideal.We show that our approach's robustness is essential for the target scenario. Unlike previous approaches, ours runs in real time and constantly estimates the extrinsic transform. For both an ideal experimental setup and a real use case, comparison against these approaches shows that we outperform the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the recovered scale may be applied to the full trajectory, circumventing the need for scale estimation via sensor fusion.",60021097,University of Surrey,Guildford,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.555555555555557,0.14696969696969697,0.40871212121212125,1

This means that the robot is able to autonomously, or actively, explore and create a reliable map of the environment, while simultaneously estimating its pose. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to robustly solve the active SLAM problem, in scenarios in which some prior information about the environment is available in the form of a topo-metric graph. This information is typically available or can be easily developed in industrial environments, but it is usually affected by uncertainties. In particular, the distinguishing features of our approach are: the inclusion of prior information for solving the active SLAM problem; the exploitation of this information to pursue active loop closure; the on-line correction of the inconsistencies in the provided data. We present some experiments, that are performed in different simulated environments: the results suggest that our method improves on state-of-the-art approaches, as it is able to deal with a wide variety of possibly large uncertainties.",60108932,"KUKA Aktiengesellschaft, Europe",Augsburg,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.666666666666668,0.07821428571428574,0.403095238095238,1
1219,1219,Reducing Handoff Delay in SDN-based 5G Networks Using AP Clustering," Published by Elsevier B.V.Densification is one of the 5G networks solutions to increase data rate and network capacity. This technology aims for constructing a large number of small cells in a specific area which may include different wireless technologies (LTE, IEEE 802.11, WiMAX, etc.). Small cells provide shorter distance between the cell access point and the mobile node which will reduce the signal attenuation and noise. This could generate a better connection, which goes along with the expectations of high data rate requests for the year 2020. The downside of the densification is that frequent handoffs will be a challenge for the network nodes. A software-defined network SDN, on the other hand, is another promising solution for 5G networks which controls the network through centralization. Using these two solutions, the handoffs in the network are expected to be frequent and hence a more delay will be added. To reduce such delay, a distributed-mobility-management technique is used in SDN-based networks, where the mobile node takes the handoff decision. This paper has focused on the issue of the distributed-handoff delay and handover failure of mobile nodes in SDN-based IEEE 802.11 network. It proposes a hybrid clustering technique using K-mean and genetic algorithm to cluster the network. The clustering aims to reduce the scanning phase of the mobile node by minimizing the number of access points that need to be scanned for the handoff. The results show lower delays and a reduced number of handoff failure compared to the un-clustered network.",60004582,King Abdulaziz University,Jeddah,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],20.75,0.025997023809523814,0.40428571428571425,0

The gait planning is addressed through a scalable nonlinear programming using direct collocation and HZD. The controller synthesis for the exponential stability is then achieved through the Poincaré sections analysis. In particular, we employ an iterative optimization algorithm involving linear and bilinear matrix inequalities (LMIs and BMIs) to design HZD-based controllers that guarantee the exponential stability of the fixed points for the Poincaré return map.

1222,1222,Object Rearrangement with Nested Nonprehensile Manipulation Actions,"This paper considers the problem of rearrangement planning, i.e finding a sequence of manipulation actions that displace multiple objects from an initial configuration to a given goal configuration. Rearrangement is a critical skill for robots so that they can effectively operate in confined spaces that contain clutter. Examples of tasks that require rearrangement include packing objects inside a bin, wherein objects need to lay according to a predefined pattern. In tight bins, collision-free grasps are often unavailable. Nonprehensile actions, such as pushing and sliding, are preferred because they can be performed using minimalistic end-effectors that can easily be inserted in the bin. Rearrangement with nonprehensile actions is a challenging problem as it requires reasoning about object interactions in a combinatorially large configuration space of multiple objects. This work revisits several existing rearrangement planning techniques and introduces a new one that exploits nested nonprehensile actions by pushing several similar objects simultaneously along the same path, which removes the need to rearrange each object individually. Experiments in simulation and using a real Kuka robotic arm show the ability of the proposed approach to solve difficult rearrangement tasks while reducing the length of the end-effector's trajectories.",123289192,Univ Piscataway,Piscataway,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.125,0.06870585554796081,0.39616655274550017,1

In this paper, we address the modal aspects of a SLAM system and show that the design of the modal controller has a strong impact on SLAM performance in particular in terms of robustness against unforeseen events such as sensor failures, perceptual aliasing or kidnapping. We preset a novel taxonomy for the components of a modern SLAM system, investigate their interplay and propose a highly modular architecture of a generic SLAM system using the Unified Modeling LanguageTM (UML) state machine formalism.

In contrast with existing datasets, we also calibrate the light source itself and publish data for inferring more complex light models. Ground-truth position data are available for a subset of sequences, as captured by a Leica total station.

1225,1225,Multilevel Incremental Roadmap Spanners for Reactive Motion Planning,"Generating robot motions from a precomputed graph has proven to be an effective approach to solving many motion planning problems. After their generation, roadmaps reduce complex motion planning problems to that of solving a graph-based shortest path. However, generating the graph can involve tradeoffs, such as how sparse or dense to make the graph. Sparse graphs may not provide enough options to navigate around a new obstacle or may result in grossly suboptimal motions. Dense graphs may take too long to search and result in an unresponsive robot. In this paper we present an algorithm that generates a graph with multiple sparse levels- The sparsest level can be searched quickly, while the densest level allows for asymptotically optimal motions. With the paired multilevel shortest path algorithm, after the robot computes an initial solution, it can then incrementally refine the shortest-path as time allows. We demonstrate the algorithms on an articulated robot with 8 degrees of freedom, having them compute an initial solution in a fraction of the time required for a full graph search, and subsequently, incrementally refine the solution to the optimal shortest path from the densest level of the graph.",60025111,The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Chapel Hill,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.0,0.10464646464646465,0.3103030303030303,1
1226,1226,A Multiclass EEG Signal Classification Model using Spatial Feature Extraction and XGBoost Algorithm,"Brain-computer interface is a framework which provides a communicating pathway between the human brain and neuroprosthetic devices. In this work, we have performed signal smoothing to fix unregulated electroencephalogram (EEG) fluctuations and to effectively collect hidden patterns in corresponding EEG spectra. To do it, we have applied a Savitzky Golay function because of its ability to preserve spectral properties without distorting it much. For feature selection, we have applied the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm with the Principle Component Analysis (PCA). FBCSP creates 11352 features from EEG signals and PCA gradually reduces the features to 185 most significant features. These features are utilized in the classification process by the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with suitable node split criteria to manage optimal tree height. A five-fold cross-validation approach concludes the superior performance of XGBoost in terms of minimizing execution time (3.7 times faster in the training phase) and providing improved accuracy as compared to existing results. Our approach enhances classification accuracy (88.80%) by approximately 10% over regularized common spatial patterns (78.01% accuracy), 15% over shift variance approximation (73.84% accuracy) and 15% over Riemannian approach (74.77% accuracy).

In particular, we focus on situations where such way-point constraints are imposed on certain partial state variables, rather than on full state variables. Our proposed framework, based on rapidly exploring random trees star (RRT) in a bidirectional manner, enables an aerial manipulator to find an optimal trajectory that satisfies way-point constraints with only partial specifications. Here, we suggest an extra merging process to integrate the trees, each originated from the start and goal point. In the merging process, we search various candidate points satisfying a given condition that partially constrains state variables, and select a way-point with full specifications optimal in the perspective of the entire trajectory.

This problem presents a number of major challenges. Video demonstrations without teleoperation are easy for humans to provide, but do not provide any direct supervision. Learning policies from raw pixels enables full generality but calls for large function approximators with many parameters to be learned. Finally, compound tasks can require impractical amounts of demonstration data, when treated as a monolithic skill. To address these challenges, we propose a method that learns both how to learn primitive behaviors from video demonstrations and how to dynamically compose these behaviors to perform multi-stage tasks by 'watching' a human demonstrator. Our results on a simulated Sawyer robot and real PR2 robot illustrate our method for learning a variety of order fulfillment and kitchen serving tasks with novel objects and raw pixel inputs.

1229,1229,Preliminary Evaluation of an Orbital Camera for Teleoperation of Remote Manipulators,"Conventional teleoperative interfaces, used for remote manipulation in the nuclear industry, utilise multiple stationary CCTV cameras for situational awareness. This is cognitively challenging for the human operator, who must mentally combine information from multiple 2D views, before attempting 3D reasoning about the remote environment. To enhance performance on telemanipulation tasks, this paper explores the merits of employing an orbital camera view. The orbital camera's gaze direction is automatically fixated towards the robot's moving end-effector. Meanwhile, the camera can be controlled by the operator to move on a spherical surface around the end-effector, in addition to zooming capability. The robot's Cartesian motion coordinates are also continuously transformed to be controllable with respect to the axes of the orbital camera view. Human test-subject experiments were conducted in a simulation environment using novice robot operators, and a variety of metrics were collected. Although the results do not show an objective difference between the camera modes, participant interviews suggest the orbital camera is the preferred method for visual feedback with its dynamic views helping to overcome positioning difficulties associated with stationary cameras. The experiment also revealed significant confounding factors that contributed to the results being inconclusive. These are discussed and recommendations are made for future empirical experiments to evaluate such systems.",60019702,University of Birmingham,Birmingham,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.7,0.03325892857142857,0.25148809523809523,1
1230,1230,LEGO: Leveraging Experience in Roadmap Generation for Sampling-Based Planning,"We consider the problem of leveraging prior experience to generate roadmaps in sampling-based motion planning. A desirable roadmap is one that is sparse, allowing for fast search, with nodes spread out at key locations such that a low- cost feasible path exists. An increasingly popular approach is to learn a distribution of nodes that would produce such a roadmap. State-of-the-art is to train a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) on the prior dataset with the shortest paths as target input. While this is quite effective on many problems, we show it can fail in the face of complex obstacle configurations or mismatch between training and testing. We present an algorithm LEGO that addresses these issues by training the CVAE with target samples that satisfy two important criteria. Firstly, these samples belong only to bottleneck regions along near-optimal paths that are otherwise difficult- to-sample with a uniform sampler. Secondly, these samples are spread out across diverse regions to maximize the likelihood of a feasible path existing. We formally define these properties and prove performance guarantees for LEGO. We extensively evaluate LEGO on a range of planning problems, including robot arm planning, and report significant gains over heuristics as well as learned baselines.",60015481,"University of Washington, Seattle",Seattle,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.0,0.08125,0.5170833333333333,1

Learning such models from data involves collecting naturalistic data of real-world human behavior. In many cases, acquisition of this data can be prohibitively expensive or intrusive. Additionally, the available data often contain only typical behaviors and exclude behaviors that are classified as rare events. To evaluate the performance of AVs in such situations, we develop a model of traffic behavior based on the theory of bounded rationality. Based on the experiments performed on a large naturalistic driving data, we show that the developed model can be applied to estimate probability of rare events, as well as to generate new traffic situations for testing.",60014171,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Canada,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.666666666666668,0.1329289131920711,0.5153394850763273,1

Using synthesis also allows end-users to specify and dynamically change the robot's behaviors using high-level requirements of goals and constraints rather than by tuning low-level controller parameters.

Composed of a bistable buckled beam driven by conductive super-coiled polymer (CSCP) actuators, this type of electromechanical system features non-trivial relationships between its design parameters and resulting behavioral characteristics. In this paper we present an efficient method to rapidly design mechanical logic structures from desired behavioral specifications. We describe this dynamic system with a simplified, quasi-static model, whose validity is verified by time constant comparison. An analytical formula of the mechanical logic's behavioral characteristics, i.e. its oscillation period, is then derived as a simplified expression of the design parameters. Based on this expression, we formulate the design of mechanical logic from behavioral specifications into an optimization problem that maximizes the robustness to manufacturing tolerances, as demonstrated by an example case study.",60027550,"University of California, Los Angeles",Los Angeles,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.0,0.042857142857142864,0.38571428571428573,1

This paper proposes an optimization model to search for precision grasps with multi-fingered hands. The model takes noisy point cloud of the object as input and optimizes the grasp quality by iteratively searching for the palm pose and finger joints positions. The collision between the hand and the object is approximated and penalized by a series of least-squares. The collision approximation is able to handle the point cloud representation of the objects with complex shapes. The proposed optimization model is able to locate collision-free optimal precision grasps efficiently. The average computation time is 0.50 sec/grasp.

While Indirect systems process an alternative image representation to compute geometric residuals, Direct methods process the image pixels directly to generate photometric residuals. Both paradigms have distinct but often complementary properties. This paper presents a Unified Formulation for Visual Odometry, referred to as UFVO, with the following key contributions: (1) a tight coupling of photometric (Direct) and geometric (Indirect) measurements using a joint multi-objective optimization, (2) the use of a utility function as a decision maker that incorporates prior knowledge on both paradigms, (3) descriptor sharing, where a feature can have more than one type of descriptor and its different descriptors are used for tracking and mapping, (4) the depth estimation of both corner features and pixel features within the same map using an inverse depth parametrization, and (5) a corner and pixel selection strategy that extracts both types of information, while promoting a uniform distribution over the image domain. Experiments show that our proposed system can handle large inter-frame motions, inherits the sub-pixel accuracy of direct methods, can run efficiently in real-time, can generate an Indirect map representation at a marginal computational cost when compared to traditional Indirect systems, all while outperforming state of the art in Direct, Indirect and hybrid systems.",60068761,American University of Beirut,Beirut,Lebanon,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",44.0,0.0393796992481203,0.4106203007518798,1

In contrast to the traditional sense-plan-act cycle, we propose a deep learning architecture and training regimen called PtPNet that can estimate effective end-effector trajectories for manipulation directly from a single RGB-D image of an object. Additionally, we present a data collection and augmentation pipeline that enables the automatic generation of large numbers (millions) of training image and trajectory examples with almost no human labeling effort.We demonstrate our approach in a non-prehensile tool-based manipulation task, specifically picking up shoes with a hook. In hardware experiments, PtPNet generates motion plans (open-loop trajectories) that reliably (89% success over 189 trials) pick up four very different shoes from a range of positions and orientations, and reliably picks up a shoe it has never seen before. Compared with a traditional sense-plan-act paradigm, our system has the advantages of operating on sparse information (single RGB-D frame), producing high-quality trajectories much faster than the expert planner (300ms versus several seconds), and generalizing effectively to previously unseen shoes.

By considering an agent's Social Value Orientation (SVO), a social psychology metric for their willingness to help another vehicle, the central coordinator can reduce system delays while ensuring each individual vehicle increases their own utility. The FCFS-SVO algorithm is both computationally tractable and accounts for a variety of real-world agent types, such as human drivers and a variety of social orientations.

This dataset was used to test the idea of transferring knowledge across different domains (e.g. from Taurus to YuMi robot) for a surgical gesture classification task with seven gestures/surgemes. We explored two different scenarios: 1) No transfer and 2) Domain transfer (simulated Taurus to real Taurus and YuMi robots).

In order to compensate for the translational and rotational movements of the knee in the sagittal plane as well as aligning the frontal plane, the proposed knee joint is implemented with a rolling joint, two aligning passive joints, four-bar linkage, and a sliding mechanism. Because the sliding mechanism, four-bar linkage, and rolling joint exist between the actuator and the joint mechanism, the rotation angle of the actuator and the flexion angle of the rolling joint do not change equally due to the kinematic characteristics. In order to define the flexion angle change of the rolling joint with respect to the change to the actuator angle in the flexion/extension motion of knee, the design parameters and flexion model are proposed in this paper. The proposed artificial knee joint effectively delivers the torque required for assistance while adapting to the joint motion of the wearer.

1249,1249,Trust but Verify: A Distributed Algorithm for Multi-Robot Wireframe Exploration and Mapping,"This paper presents a novel distributed mapping algorithm for multiple resource-constrained robots operating in a rectilinear 2D environment. The algorithm is built upon the sparse wireframe map representation and updating framework in [1]. We propose an exploration strategy based on the labeling of the vertices in the wireframe map, combined with a map-merging interrupt routine that is activated when robots enter into communication range with one another. The maps are not naively merged, but instead the receiving robot verifies the received information before it is assimilated by attempting to drive to the location where the other robot was when communication was established. The robots do not share a global coordinate frame, so prior to a merge the relative map alignment is determined. This is achieved using the random sample consensus (RANSAC) framework with a custom feature which leverages the structure inherent in the wireframe map representation. This results in a lower rate of false-positive matches compared to another state-of-the-art feature used in point cloud alignment, the 4-point congruent set (4PCS). We show our feature to be more robust to false-positive alignments, a common occurrence when attempting to align sparse structures such as wireframe maps.

Most approaches employ hard-coded heuristics or other applicaton-specific requirements, making them hard to extend to other problem scenarios or 'configurations,' such as different motion strategies or robot size. This work presents a unifying, general, and adaptive framework, called adaptive deep path (AD Path), for coverage path planning problems under a variety of configurations. It can improve path efficiency with respect to both path length and number of turns, and can flexibly accommodate different problem configuration options. We evaluate AD Path against a state-of-the-art baseline in four complex environments with different configurations. We show that our approach can produce efficient paths; our experimental results show that AD Path can reduce the path length by 21.8% and the number turns by 38.6% on average compared with the baseline.",60019647,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.166666666666668,-0.02628205128205128,0.4762820512820513,1

However, the lack of precise calibration negatively affects their potential applications. In this paper, we propose a novel system that enables automatic multi-LiDAR calibration method without any calibration target, prior environment information, and manual initialization. Our approach starts with a hand-eye calibration by aligning the motion of each sensor. The initial results are then refined by an appearance-based method by minimizing a cost function constructed by point-plane distance. Experimental results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of our calibration approach. The proposed approach can calibrate a multi-LiDAR system with the rotation and translation errors less than 0. 04rad and 0. 1m respectively for a mobile platform.",60008592,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",14.0,0.07348484848484849,0.38333333333333325,1

Unfortunately, such measurements commonly suffer from outliers in a dynamic environment, since frequently it is assumed that only the robot is in motion and the world is static. To this end, robust state estimation schemes are mandatory in order for humanoids to symbiotically co-exist with humans in their daily dynamic environments. In this article, the robust Gaussian Error-State Kalman Filter for humanoid robot locomotion is presented. The introduced method automatically detects and rejects outliers without relying on any prior knowledge on measurement distributions or finely tuned thresholds. Subsequently, the proposed method is quantitatively and qualitatively assessed in realistic conditions with the full-size humanoid robot WALK-MAN v2.0 and the mini-size humanoid robot NAO to demonstrate its accuracy and robustness when outlier VOLO measurements are present.

We regularize the ill-conditioned problem of scene flow estimation in a unified framework by enforcing piecewise rigid motion through decomposition into rotational and translational motion parts. Our model crucially regularizes these components by an L0 'norm', thereby facilitating implicit motion segmentation in a joint energy minimization problem. Yet, we also show that this energy can be efficiently minimized by a proximal primal-dual algorithm. By implementing this approximate L0 rigid motion regularization, our scene flow estimation approach implicitly segments the observed scene of into regions of nearly constant rigid motion. We evaluate our joint scene flow and segmentation estimation approach on a variety of test scenarios, with and without ground truth data, and demonstrate that we outperform current scene flow techniques.",60024260,Universität Siegen,Siegen,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.833333333333332,-0.1,0.5833333333333334,1

Fast and accurate segmentation of 3D LiDAR points is an important issue in mobile robotics with various applications in classification, tracking, SLAM, etc. Despite its importance, existing methods do not provide both speed and accuracy; in particular, methods performing segmentation in the 3D domain are too slow, disabling its use in real-time processing. In this paper, we propose Curved-Voxel Clustering (CVC), a fast and accurate method for segmenting 3D LiDAR point clouds utilizing LiDAR-optimized curved-voxel. CVC attains fine discriminations by considering three important aspects for clustering 3D LiDAR points: distance from the sensor, directional resolutions, and rarity of points. CVC succeeds in providing real-time performance by carefully managing curved-voxels with a hash table. Especially, CVC works well on sparse 3D point clouds. Through experiments, we show that our method is up to 1.7× faster and 30% more accurate than other segmentation methods.

This actuator can be easily made by soft materials including rubber tube, one-way extensible cloth, inextensible cloth and wire. 2 types of structures are presented based on different working circumstances. When pressurized, the actuator can curve and then coil to a helical shape due to the different extensibilities of its opposite sides, a high contraction length and large contraction force can be achieved synchronously. Experiments are conducted to show the relationship between contraction force and contraction ratio of this actuator. The high contraction ratio of this actuator is revealed by comparing with McKibben actuator under the same condition, the maximal contraction ratio reaches 78% and the actuation stress is 8.36kPa.",60031126,Tokyo Institute of Technology,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.142857142857142,0.1173299319727891,0.46013605442176875,1

Previous research on learning-based referring expressions has focused primarily on comprehension tasks, while generating referring expressions is still mostly limited to rule-based methods. In this work, we propose a two-stage approach that relies on deep learning for estimating spatial relations to describe an object naturally and unambiguously with a referring expression. We compare our method to the state of the art algorithm in ambiguous environments (e.g., environments that include very similar objects with similar relationships). We show that our method generates referring expressions that people find to be more accurate (30% better) and would prefer to use (32% more often).",60004305,Middle East Technical University (METU),Ankara,Turkey,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.0,0.20442176870748302,0.4902040816326531,1
1257,1257,StartNet: Online detection of action start in untrimmed videos,"We propose StartNet to address Online Detection of Action Start (ODAS) where action starts and their associated categories are detected in untrimmed, streaming videos. Previous methods aim to localize action starts by learning feature representations that can directly separate the start point from its preceding background. It is challenging due to the subtle appearance difference near the action starts and the lack of training data. Instead, StartNet decomposes ODAS into two stages: Action classification (using ClsNet) and start point localization (using LocNet). ClsNet focuses on per-frame labeling and predicts action score distributions online. Based on the predicted action scores of the past and current frames, LocNet conducts class-agnostic start detection by optimizing long-term localization rewards using policy gradient methods. The proposed framework is validated on two large-scale datasets, THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet. The experimental results show that StartNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 15%-30% p-mAP under the offset tolerance of 1-10 seconds on THUMOS'14, and achieves comparable performance on ActivityNet with 10 times smaller time offset.",60021121,Indiana University Bloomington,Bloomington,United States,"['1712', '1707']",20.625,0.05555555555555555,0.33148148148148154,1
1258,1258,Computing a Minimal Set of t-Spanning Motion Primitives for Lattice Planners,"In this paper we consider the problem of computing an optimal set of motion primitives for a lattice planner. The objective we consider is to compute a minimal set of motion primitives that t-span a configuration space lattice. A set of motion primitives t-span a lattice if, given a real number t greater or equal to one, any configuration in the lattice can be reached via a sequence of motion primitives whose cost is no more than t times the cost of the optimal path to that configuration. Determining the smallest set of t-spanning motion primitives allows for quick traversal of a state lattice in the context of robotic motion planning, while maintaining a t-factor adherence to the theoretically optimal path. While several heuristics exist to determine a t-spanning set of motion primitives, these are presented without guarantees on the size of the set relative to optimal. This paper provides a proof that the minimal t-spanning control set problem for a lattice defined over an arbitrary robot configuration space is NP-complete, and presents a compact mixed integer linear programming formulation to compute an optimal t-spanner. We show that solutions obtained by the mixed integer linear program have significantly fewer motion primitives than state of the art heuristic algorithms, and out perform a set of standard primitives used in robotic path planning.",60014171,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Canada,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",31.571428571428573,0.03657407407407408,0.3236111111111111,1

However, there are no available mathematical models to accurately estimate the strain as a function of the measured resistance. Furthermore, non-uniform strain in the microchannels has not been analysed yet. In this paper, we introduce a new model to estimate the strain or elongation in sub-millimetre scale, and analyse its accuracy through a customised testing set-up and procedure. The effect of strain rate on the measurement accuracy is also studied. We compare existing theoretical models with our experimental results, and discuss the differences between them. Moreover, we analyse the effect of strain rate on hysteresis caused by the viscoelastic behaviour and introduce a new model for it to be potentially used for future work. This paper demonstrates, among other things, that rational models could provide high accuracy in strain estimation, and might help to enhance proprioceptive sensing and state control of soft robots.",60025709,The University of Sydney,Sydney,Australia,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.5,0.0871818181818182,0.4354949494949495,1

Such actions are necessary for certain robotics tasks, e.g., clearing a dining table or packing a warehouse bin. However, using an RGB-D camera to detect success can be insufficient: same-colored objects can be difficult to differentiate, and reflective silverware cause noisy depth camera perception. We show that adding static data about the objects themselves improves the performance of an end-to-end pipeline for classifying action outcomes. Images of the objects, and language expressions describing them, encode prior geometry, shape, and size information that refine classification accuracy. We collect over 13 hours of egocentric manipulation data for training a model to reason about whether a robot successfully placed unseen objects in or on one another.

1261,1261,A Data-Driven Framework for Learning Dexterous Manipulation of Unknown Objects,"We address the problem of developing precision, quasi-static control strategies for fingertip manipulation in robot hands. In general, analytically specifying useful object transition maps, or hand-object Jacobians, for scenarios in which there is uncertainty in some key aspect of the hand-object system is difficult or impossible. This could be in scenarios with standard fully-actuated hands where, for instance, there is not an accurate model of the contact conditions, or in scenarios with fewer control inputs than mechanical degrees of freedom (such as underactuated hands or those that are controlled by synergies or impedance controlled frameworks), since the output space is of higher dimension than the input space. In this work, we develop a method for extracting object transition maps by tracking the state of the grasp frame. We begin by modeling a compliant, underactuated hand and its mechanical properties through an energy-based approach. From this energy model, we provide controlled actuation inputs to change the state of the grasp frame. We observe the response from these actions and develop a regression map of the action-reaction pairs, where the map is subject to our intent for grasp frame movement and the regional relationship between the contacts. Once the regression model is developed, we perform within-hand planning of the grasp frame with newly introduced objects. This approach is agnostic to the global geometry of the object and is able to adapt when undesirable contact conditions, such as sliding, occur. The learning-based methodology estimates the non-linearities representative in the properties of the system. We test our framework physically on an adapted Yale Openhand Model O. By transferring the learned model from simulation to the physical hand without adaptation, we show that this energy modeling approach is robust to inaccuracies in parameter estimation. We demonstrate its efficacy in a handwriting task.",60005455,Yale University,New Haven,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.846153846153847,0.023707664884135476,0.4489368474662592,1

1263,1263,Bidirectional Heuristic Search for Motion Planning with an Extend Operator,"Sampling-based approaches are often favored in robotics for high-dimensional motion planning for their fast exploration of the search space. However, at best they offer asymptotic guarantees on solution quality due to their inherent stochasticity. While planning, the majority of effort is often spent near the start and goal configurations with a large amount of free space in between. Bidirectional approaches such as RRT-Connect exploit this fact by greedily extending and connecting search frontiers that simultaneously propagate from the start and goal configurations of a planning problem. In this work, we use such an extend operator for bidirectional heuristic search-based planners, which typically struggle with high-dimensionality. In doing so, we address the difficulty that these bidirectional planners face with connecting frontiers of both search efforts while providing suboptimality bounds on solution quality. We validate our simple approach on high-dimensional manipulation tasks, demonstrating significantly reduced search effort when compared against other popular bidirectional algorithms, both search-based and sampling. Our algorithm maintains theoretical guarantees on suboptimality and completeness for a given resolution. In addition, the solutions found by our planner are of higher quality compared to those found by the other baseline algorithms.",60027950,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.11111111111111,0.18320105820105823,0.4936507936507937,1

In this regard, we propose a neural network architecture capable of fusing depth images along with roll and pitch measurements on board the robot to perform traversability estimation. The proposed architecture is trained in a variety of simulated structured and unstructured environments. As such, the proposed architecture is capable of extracting the relevant features from the sensor measurements in a data driven manner as compared to existing heuristic based approaches that fail to generalize for different environmental conditions. The reliability of the traversability estimates provided by the trained architecture was validated in indoor and outdoor conditions using real sensor data. In addition, the feasibility of using the traversability estimates in incremental path planning was also demonstrated through simulation.

The risk of navigation is usually said to be the probability of collision. This notion of risk is not well defined in the literature, especially when dealing with occupancy grids. The Bayesian occupancy grid is the most used method to deal with complex environments. However, this is not fitted to compute the risk along a path by its discrete nature. In this article, we present a new way to store the occupancy of the environment that allows the computation of risk along a given path. We then define the risk as the force of collision that would occur for a given obstacle.

In recent years, camera only or camera-IMU (inertial measurement unit) based localization methods are widely studied, in terms of theoretical properties, algorithm design, and real-world applications. However, we experimentally find that none of existing methods is able to perform high-precision and robust localization for ground robots in large-scale complicated 3D environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel vision-based localization algorithm dedicatedly designed for ground robots, by fusing measurements from a camera, an IMU, and the wheel odometer. The first contribution of this paper is that we propose a novel algorithm for approximating the motion manifold for ground robots by parametric representation and performing pose integrating via IMU and wheel odometer measurements. Secondly, we propose a complete localization algorithm, by using a sliding-window based estimator. The estimator is designed based on iterative optimization to fuse measurements from multiple sensors on the proposed manifold representation.

1267,1267,Safe physical HRI: Toward a unified treatment of speed and separation monitoring together with power and force limiting,"So-called collaborative robots are a current trend in industrial robotics. However, they still face many problems in practical application such as reduced speed to ascertain their collaborativeness. The standards prescribe two regimes: (i) speed and separation monitoring and (ii) power and force limiting, where the former requires reliable estimation of distances between the robot and human body parts and the latter imposes constraints on the energy absorbed during collisions prior to robot stopping. Following the standards, we deploy the two collaborative regimes in a single application and study the performance in a mock collaborative task under the individual regimes, including transitions between them. Additionally, we compare the performance under 'safety zone monitoring' with keypoint pair-wise separation distance assessment relying on an RGB-D sensor and skeleton extraction algorithm to track human body parts in the workspace. Best performance has been achieved in the following setting: robot operates at full speed until a distance threshold between any robot and human body part is crossed; then, reduced robot speed per power and force limiting is triggered. Robot is halted only when the operator's head crosses a predefined distance from selected robot parts.

Traditional methods for solving VO mostly utilize geometric optimization. While capable of achieving high accuracy, these methods require accurate sensor calibration and complicated parameter tuning to work well in practice. With the rise of deep learning, there has been increased interest in the end-to-end, learning-based methods for VO, which have the potential to improve robustness. However, learning-based methods for VO so far are less accurate than geometric methods. We argue that one of the main issues is that the current ego-motion estimation task is different from other problems where deep learning has been successful such as object detection. We define a novel cost function for learning-based VO considering the mathematical properties of the group homomorphism. In addition to the standard L2 loss, we incorporate losses based on the identity, inverse and closure properties of SE(3) rigid motion. Furthermore, we propose to reduce the VO drift by estimating the drivable regions using semantic segmentation and incorporate this information into a pose graph optimization.

Manhattan world holds for the scenes with three orthogonal VPs. In Manhattan world, given several lines in a calibrated image, we aim at clustering them by three unknown-but-sought VPs. The VP estimation can be reformulated as computing the rotation between the Manhattan frame and the camera frame. To compute this rotation, state-of-the-art methods are based on either data sampling or parameter search, and they fail to guarantee the accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. In contrast, we propose to hybridize these two strategies. We first compute two degrees of freedom (DOF) of the above rotation by two sampled image lines, and then search for the optimal third DOF based on the branch-and-bound. Our sampling accelerates our search by reducing the search space and simplifying the bound computation.

1273,1273,Variable Impedance Control in End-Effector Space: An Action Space for Reinforcement Learning in Contact-Rich Tasks,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) of contact-rich manipulation tasks has yielded impressive results in recent years. While many studies in RL focus on varying the observation space or reward model, few efforts focused on the choice of action space (e.g. joint or end-effector space, position, velocity, etc.). However, studies in robot motion control indicate that choosing an action space that conforms to the characteristics of the task can simplify exploration and improve robustness to disturbances. This paper studies the effect of different action spaces in deep RL and advocates for variable impedance control in end-effector space (VICES) as an advantageous action space for constrained and contact-rich tasks. We evaluate multiple action spaces on three prototypical manipulation tasks: Path Following (task with no contact), Door Opening (task with kinematic constraints), and Surface Wiping (task with continuous contact). We show that VICES improves sample efficiency, maintains low energy consumption, and ensures safety across all three experimental setups. Further, RL policies learned with VICES can transfer across different robot models in simulation, and from simulation to real for the same robot.

1274,1274,Continuous close-range 3D object pose estimation,"In the context of future manufacturing lines, removing fixtures will be a fundamental step to increase the flexibility of autonomous systems in assembly and logistic operations. Vision-based 3D pose estimation is a necessity to accurately handle objects that might not be placed at fixed positions during the robot task execution. Industrial tasks bring multiple challenges for the robust pose estimation of objects such as difficult object properties, tight cycle times and constraints on camera views. In particular, when interacting with objects, we have to work with close-range partial views of objects that pose a new challenge for typical view-based pose estimation methods.In this paper, we present a 3D pose estimation method based on a gradient-ascend particle filter that integrates new observations on-the-fly to improve the pose estimate. Thereby, we can apply this method online during task execution to save valuable cycle time. In contrast to other view-based pose estimation methods, we model potential views in full 6dimensional space that allows us to cope with close-range partial objects views. We demonstrate the approach on a real assembly task, in which the algorithm usually converges to the correct pose within 10-15 iterations with an average accuracy of less than 8mm.",60030840,Københavns Universitet,Copenhagen,Denmark,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.285714285714285,0.006931326249508065,0.3967335694608422,1

Besides adding gravitational load to the robot, which results in larger joint torques, such payloads influence the collision safety characteristics through changing surface curvature properties, reflected mass and effective robot speed along a desired motion direction. In this paper, we evaluate the effect a known, unactuated pay-load that is attached to the end-effector has on the intantaneous reflected inertial parameters and maximum task velocity of a robot. The proposed mass update approach relies on the analysis of the kinetic energy matrices, while the velocity maximization is tackled by formulating static optimization problems with different constraints on angular motion of the end-effector. Finally, for analyzing the validity of the introduced approach in the framework of Safety Maps, we discuss simulation results of a PUMA 560 robot that has an exemplary payload attached to its end-effector.",60117697,Munich School of Robotics and Machine Intelligence,Munich,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",29.4,0.125,0.625,1

Perception as prediction learns data-driven predictions relating to the impact of actions on the agent's perception of the world. It also provides a data-driven approach to predict the impact of the anticipated behavior of other agents on the world without explicitly learning their policy or intentions. We demonstrate perception as prediction by learning to predict an agent's front safety and rear safety with GVFs, which encapsulate anticipation of the behavior of the vehicle in front and in the rear, respectively. The safety predictions are learned through random interactions in a simulated environment containing other agents. We show that these predictions can be used to produce similar control behavior to an LQR-based controller in an adaptive cruise control problem as well as provide advanced warning when the vehicle behind is approaching dangerously. The predictions are compact policy-based predictions that support prediction of the long term impact on safety when following a given policy. We analyze two controllers that use the learned predictions in a racing simulator to understand the value of the predictions and demonstrate their use in the real-world on a Clearpath Jackal robot and an autonomous vehicle platform.",60030835,University of Alberta,Edmonton,Canada,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.375,-0.03928571428571428,0.4535714285714286,1

Recent approaches exploit the power of convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve accurate grasping at the cost of high computational power and time. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised learning based algorithm for the selection of feasible grasp regions. Unsupervised learning infers the pattern in dataset without any external labels. We applied k-means clustering at every sampling stage in image plane to identify the grasp regions, followed by axes assignment method. We define a novel concept of Grasp Decide Index (GDI) to select the best grasp pose in the image plane.

1278,1278,Time-Varying Graph Patrolling Against Attackers with Locally Limited and Imperfect Observation Models,"The use of autonomous robots for surveillance is one of the most interesting applications of graph-patrolling algorithms. In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to tackling the problem of efficiently computing effective patrolling strategies. One of the mainstream approaches is adversarial patrolling, where a model of a strategic attacker is explicitly taken into account. A common assumption made by these techniques is to consider a worst-case attacker, characterized by ubiquitous and perfect observation capabilities. Motivated by the domain of robotic applications, we instead consider a more realistic and limited attacker model capable of gathering noisy observations in a locally limited range of the environment. We assume that the modeled attacker follows a behavior induced by its observations. Thus, we devise a randomized patrolling strategy based on Markov chains that makes observations reveal very little information, while still maintaining a reasonable level of protection in the environment. Our experimental results obtained in simulation confirm time-variance as a practical approach for our objective.",60030318,Università degli Studi di Milano,Milan,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.25,0.1933366402116402,0.45383597883597887,1
1279,1279,TZC: Efficient Inter-Process Communication for Robotics Middleware with Partial Serialization,"Inter-process communication (IPC) is one of the core functions of modern robotics middleware. We propose an efficient IPC technique called TZC (Towards Zero-Copy). As a core component of TZC, we design a novel algorithm called partial serialization. Our formulation can generate messages that can be divided into two parts. During message transmission, one part is transmitted through a socket and the other part uses shared memory. The part within shared memory is never copied or serialized during its lifetime. We have integrated TZC with ROS and ROS2 and find that TZC can be easily combined with current open-source platforms. By using TZC, the overhead of IPC remains constant when the message size grows. In particular, when the message size is 4MB (less than the size of a full HD image), TZC can reduce the overhead of ROS IPC from tens of milliseconds to hundreds of microseconds and can reduce the overhead of ROS2 IPC from hundreds of milliseconds to less than 1 millisecond. We also demonstrate the benefits of TZC by integrating it with TurtleBot2 to be used in autonomous driving scenarios. We show that by using TZC, the braking distance can be 16% shorter than with ROS.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",18.0,0.09015151515151515,0.38712121212121214,1
1280,1280,Optimal Temporal Logic Planning for Multi-Robot Systems in Uncertain Semantic Maps,"This paper addresses a multi-robot motion planning problem in probabilistic maps obtained by semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The goal of the robots is to accomplish complex collaborative high level tasks captured by global temporal logic specifications in the presence of uncertainty in the workspace. Specifically, the robots operate in an unknown environment modeled as a semantic map determined by Gaussian distributions over landmark positions and arbitrary discrete distributions over landmark classes. We extend Linear Temporal Logic by including information-based predicates allowing us to incorporate uncertainty and probabilistic satisfaction requirements directly into the task specification. We propose a new highly scalable sampling-based approach that synthesizes paths that satisfy the assigned task specification while minimizing a user-specified motion cost function. Finally, we show that the proposed algorithm is probabilistically complete, asymptotically optimal and supported by convergence rate bounds. We provide extensive simulation results that corroborate the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed algorithm can address large-scale planning tasks.",60006297,University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.714285714285715,0.013030303030303033,0.44732323232323234,1

In such realistic scenarios, fine-grained object categorization is as important as basic-level object categorization. We tackle this problem by proposing an open-ended object recognition approach which concurrently learns both the object categories and the local features for encoding objects. In this work, each object is represented using a set of general latent visual topics and category-specific dictionaries. The general topics encode the common patterns of all categories, while the category-specific dictionary describes the content of each category in details. The proposed approach discovers both sets of general and specific representations in an unsupervised fashion and updates them incrementally using new object views. Experimental results show that our approach yields significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art approaches concerning scalability and object classification performance. Moreover, our approach demonstrates the capability of learning from very few training examples in a real-world setting. Regarding computation time, the best result was obtained with a Bag-of-Words method followed by a variant of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach.",60010023,University of Groningen,Groningen,Netherlands,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.555555555555557,0.10796650717703349,0.41497607655502394,1
1282,1282,A VR System for Immersive Teleoperation and Live Exploration with a Mobile Robot,"Applications like disaster management and industrial inspection often require experts to enter contaminated places. To circumvent the need for physical presence, it is desirable to generate a fully immersive individual live teleoperation experience. However, standard video-based approaches suffer from a limited degree of immersion and situation awareness due to the restriction to the camera view, which impacts the navigation. In this paper, we present a novel VR-based practical system for immersive robot teleoperation and scene exploration. While being operated through the scene, a robot captures RGB-D data that is streamed to a SLAM-based live multiclient telepresence system. Here, a global 3D model of the already captured scene parts is reconstructed and streamed to the individual remote user clients where the rendering for e.g. head-mounted display devices (HMDs) is performed. We introduce a novel lightweight robot client component which transmits robot-specific data and enables a quick integration into existing robotic systems. This way, in contrast to first- person exploration systems, the operators can explore and navigate in the remote site completely independent of the current position and view of the capturing robot, complementing traditional input devices for teleoperation. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and demonstrate the capabilities as well as the performance of our system regarding interactive object measurements and bandwidth-efficient data streaming and visualization. Furthermore, we show its benefits over purely video-based teleoperation in a user study revealing a higher degree of situation awareness and a more precise navigation in challenging environments.",60007493,Universität Bonn,Bonn,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.0,0.09669207603990213,0.3682194616977226,1

Ideally, the way the robot avoids the pedestrians should not only be physically safe but also perceived safe and comfortable. Despite the rich literature in collision-free crowd navigation, limited research has been conducted on how humans perceive robot behaviors in the navigation context. In this paper, we implement three local pedestrian avoidance strategies inspired by human avoidance behaviors on a self-balancing mobile robot and evaluate their perception in a human-robot crossing scenario through a large-scale user study with 98 participants. The study reveals that the avoidance strategies positively affect the participants' perception of the robot's safety, comfort, and awareness to different degrees. Furthermore, the participants perceive the robot as more intelligent, friendly and reliable in the last trial than in the first even with the same strategy.",60085737,"Honda Research Institute, USA",Mountain View,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.166666666666668,0.27975553857906793,0.49195951107715813,1

However, real-world RL applications, e.g. robotic manipulation, remain challenging as most of them are multi-stage and a positive reward can only be received when the final goal is accomplished. In this work, we propose a potential solution to such problems with the introduction of an experience-based tendency reward shaping mechanism, which provides the robot with additional hints based on a discriminative learning on past experience. The reward along with a stage-awareness network help accelerate solving a multistage task split into shorter phases in a reverse curriculum learning manner. We extensively study the advantages of TRL on the standard long-term goal-oriented robotics domains such as pick-and-place, and show that TRL performs more efficiently and robustly than prior approaches in tasks with large state space. In addition, we demonstrate that TRL can solve difficult robot manipulation challenges directly from perception.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.285714285714285,0.10707792207792208,0.5503679653679654,1

By explicitly exploiting the property that the basic excavation motion lies on the excavation plane determined by excavator links, we further reduce the construction of the map from 3D Euclidean space to 2D excavation plane. We show the pre-computed reachability map can be used to develop new excavator motion planning approach. By indexing on the pre-computed reachability map, we can efficiently compute the feasible full-bucket trajectory for single step excavation operation.

1286,1286,Active Inverse Model Learning with Error and Reachable Set Estimates,"In this work, we propose a framework to learn an inverse model of redundant systems. We address three problems. By formalizing what it actually means to learn an inverse model, we derive a method where the inverse model, represented as a neural network, is learned by minimizing an upper bound on the real performance error, which is provided by a forward model (kernel regression or Gaussian process) learned on the currently available data. Most machine learning methods focus on learning the mapping of the function. For inverse models, it is, however, crucial to know the reachable set of the true forward model, since this becomes the domain of the inverse. Therefore, we secondly propose a method to estimate the reachable set of the system. Finally, we develop an active exploration strategy that is based on maximizing a lower bound on the true fill-distance to efficiently generate the data in the high dimensional input space. A key feature of our method is that the resulting learned inverse model provides error bounds on its performance.From an application point of view, this work is motivated by learning to control musculoskeletal systems. In the experiments, we show for both a simulated model of a human arm with six muscles and a real muscle-driven robot that the proposed method is able to learn the reachable set of these systems as well as a policy that enables to accurately control the position.",60015815,Universität Stuttgart,Stuttgart,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.22222222222222,0.15148148148148147,0.47768518518518516,1

Learning deep neural networks for image understanding, however, requires large amounts of domain-specific visual data. While collecting such data from real robots is possible, such an approach limits the scalability as learning policies typically requires thousands of trials.In this work we attempt to learn manipulation policies in simulated environments. Simulators enable scalability and provide access to the underlying world state during training. Policies learned in simulators, however, do not transfer well to real scenes given the domain gap between real and synthetic data. We follow recent work on domain randomization and augment synthetic images with sequences of random transformations. Our main contribution is to optimize the augmentation strategy for sim2real transfer and to enable domain-independent policy learning. We design an efficient search for depth image augmentations using object localization as a proxy task. Given the resulting sequence of random transformations, we use it to augment synthetic depth images during policy learning. Our augmentation strategy is policy-independent and enables policy learning with no real images.

The self-segregation allowed by this effect lead to the simplification of the control protocol necessary for the swarm.We simulated a swarm robot system consisting of circular modules capable of changing their radius and, with the aid of externally supplied vibrations, utilising the Brazil Nut Effect to achieve segregation of the swarm. The effect also allowed for the migration of individual modules through the swarm. Additionally, we harnessed this segregation effect in simulation to create a flow of modules within the swarm, whilst the swarm was confined within a vibrating container.Lastly, we took the first steps toward physical verification of the experimental results by designing and building a prototype for a circular robot module capable of changing its radius in a manner inspired by a spiral torsion spring.",60024322,Osaka University,Suita,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",39.8,0.16071428571428573,0.4697278911564627,1

The major challenge is that cables have high degrees of freedom and are easy to deform during manipulation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework SPR-RWLS to manipulate cables, which includes real-time cable tracking and robust local deformation model approximation. For cable tracking, structure preserved registration (SPR) is utilized to robustly estimate the movement of selected points on a cable even in the presence of sensor noise, outliers, and occlusions. Robust weighted least squares (RWLS) is then applied to calculate the local deformation model of the cable under uncertainties. We show that SPR-RWLS enables the dual-arm robots to manipulate cables with different thicknesses and lengths to different desired curvatures in multiple scenarios.

Our approach first computes an n-dimensional trajectory from the start- to an arbitrary target state including position, velocity and acceleration. It respects input- and state-constraints and is thus dynamically feasible. The trajectory is then efficiently checked for collisions, exploiting the piecewise polynomial formulation. If collisions occur, viastates are inserted into the trajectory to circumvent the obstacle and still maintain time-optimality. These viastates are described by position, velocity, and acceleration. The evaluation shows that the computational demands of the proposed method are minimal such that obstacle avoidance can begin within few milliseconds. Optimality of generated trajectories, combined with the ability for frequent online re-planning from non-hover initial conditions, make the approach well suited for evasion of suddenly perceived obstacles during fast flight.",60007493,Universität Bonn,Bonn,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",17.875,0.04545454545454546,0.36666666666666664,1

The control method is based on the Follow-the-contact-point (FCP) gait control that operates on the principle that each leg follows the contact point of its foreleg. Hence, planning the contact points for all the legs are summarized to one of the front legs. To dedicate the FCP gait control to a hexapod robot, three control architectures are added. First, new constraints in the transition from a stance phase to a swing phase are added to maintain static stability when a leg leaves the ground. Second, a real-time posture control system for contacting legs is added. The third is an adaptive control to adjust the time elapsed in each control mode, by which specifications of deadlock-free and static stability are satisfied.

To solve the resulting optimization problem for real-time control synthesis with such time varying constraints, we propose a novel numerical scheme based on Real Time Iteration Sequential Quadratic Programming (RTI-SQP), which we call Sampling Augmented Adaptive RTI (SAA-RTI). Sampling augmentation of conventional RTI-SQP provides additional feasible candidate trajectories for warm-starting the optimization procedure. Thus, the proposed SAA-RTI algorithm enables real time constraint adaptation and reduces sensitivity to local minima.

A microfluidic cell positioning device is used to pattern two different types of cells in one dimensional array, and an image processing algorithm is applied to identify the location of the mitochondria and cell. A visual feedback control mechanism is developed to enhance the mitochondrial extraction efficiency. A robust adaptive sliding control algorithm is developed to precisely control an X-Y stage to accomplish the extraction of mitochondria from A type cell followed by injection of the mitochondria into B type cell automatically.

However, as the objects to handle in ADLs differ in size, shape and manipulation constraints, many two or three fingered end-effectors of ARMs have difficulty robustly interacting with these objects. In this paper, we propose vision-based control of a 5-fingered manipulator (Schunk SVH), automatically changing its approach based on object classification using computer vision combined with deep learning. The control method is tested in a simulated environment and achieves a more robust grasp with the properly shaped five-fingered hand than with a comparable three-fingered gripper (Barrett Hand) using the same control sequence. In addition, the final optimal grasp pose (x, y, and \theta) is learned through a deep regressor in the penultimate stage of the grasp.

1296,1296,Deep Supervised Hashing with Similar Hierarchy for Place Recognition,"Place recognition as one of the most significant requirements for long-term simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been developed rapidly in recent years. Also, deep learning is proved to be more capable than traditional methods to extract features under some complex environments. However, in real-world environments, there are many challenging problems such as viewpoint changes and illumination changes. The existing deep learning-based place recognition in extracting feature phases and matching process is both time-consuming. Moreover, features extracted from convolution neural network (CNN) are floating-point type with high dimension. In this paper, we propose deep supervised hashing for place recognition, where we design a similar hierarchy loss function to learn a model. The model can distinguish the similar images more accurately which is well suitable to place recognition.

In the case of endoscopic surgery, existing systems vary significantly from each other which raises the question of the existence of a general design that can do it all. In this context, this paper proposes to use a genetic algorithm combined with recorded suturing and anatomical data to automatically design a pair of robotic instruments for the i2Snake under strict mechanical constraints. The resulting automatically generated instrument designs include a 6 degrees of freedom instrument that can follow a predefined trajectory accurately and a more simple 4 degrees of freedom instrument that can accomplish most of the task. The results also showed the importance of having a prismatic joint to gain the precision required for endoscopic surgery.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.4,0.14166666666666666,0.4354761904761905,1

The objective for this study is to improve the speed and position estimation of the PMSM rotor which used the MRAS with the conventional PI controller. In this study, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and hybrid multilayer perceptron (HMLP) network from family of artificial neural network (ANN) were evaluated. Before the controller can be used, the value of weight between the network layers need to be optimised. To train the controller weight, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated by comparing with the proposed controller in controlling the speed and position of PMSM. Simulation results under various speed and load conditions indicated that the PSO-HMLP network controller achieved well results than the compared controller in terms transient response and overall system analysis.",60004351,Universiti Teknologi MARA,Shah Alam,Malaysia,['1700'],22.285714285714285,-0.19183673469387758,0.5653061224489796,0
1299,1299,Exploring logical consistency and viewport sensitivity in compositional VQA models,"The most recent architectures for Visual Question Answering (VQA), such as TbD or DDRprog, have already outperformed human-level accuracy on benchmark datasets (e.g. CLEVR). We administered an advanced analysis of their performance based on novel metrics called consistency (sum of all object feature instances in the scene (e.g. shapes) equals the total number of the objects in the scene) and revealed only 56% consistency for the most accurate architecture (TbD). In respect to this finding, we propose a new method of the VQA training, which reaches 98% consistency. Furthermore, testing of the VQA model in real world brings out a problem with precise mimicking of the camera position from the original dataset. We therefore created a virtual environment along with its real-world counterpart with variable camera positions to test the accuracy and consistency from different viewports. Based on these errors, we were able to estimate optimal position of the camera. The proposed method thus allows us to find the optimal camera viewport in the real environment without knowing the geometry and the exact position of the camera in the synthetic training environment.",60013323,Ceské vysoké ucení technické v Praze,Prague,Czech Republic,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.22222222222222,0.2271390374331551,0.5184046345811052,1
1300,1300,"Brain Tumors Diagnosis and Prediction Based on Applying the Learning Metaheuristic Optimization Techniques of Particle Swarm, Ant Colony and Bee Colony"," Published by Elsevier B.V.Brain tumors are intensively studied and many techniques and algorithms have been proposed to extract the features of the brain MRI images and diagnose the tumors. The different techniques are distinguished and favored based on their accuracy and speed. This led to apply optimization methods to improve them. In this paper, we apply three methaheuristic optimization methods which recently gained much interest. These are: the Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (B-PSO), the Ant colony Travel salesman problem (ACO-TSP) and the Artificial Bee colony optimization (ABCO-BFS). These methods are carried out in two main steps. The first step is the segmentation process of the brain MRI images using K-means cluster and the second steps is the features extraction from them. We compare the results of these methods to obtain the best solution for feature extraction. The group method of data handling (GMDH) is applied to classify the extracted features for the tumors diagnosis. Prediction is also carried on by applying the GMDH method for any future complications. The accuracy of classification and prediction is obtained to be range from 88.9% to 98.8%.",60009750,Minia University,Minia,Egypt,['1700'],16.727272727272727,0.21060606060606057,0.4128787878787879,0
1301,1301,Coverage Sampling Planner for UAV-enabled Environmental Exploration and Field Mapping,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been implemented for environmental monitoring by using their capabilities of mobile sensing, autonomous navigation, and remote operation. However, in real-world applications, the limitations of on-board resources (e.g., power supply) of UAVs will constrain the coverage of the monitored area and the number of the acquired samples, which will hinder the performance of field estimation and mapping. Therefore, the issue of constrained resources calls for an efficient sampling planner to schedule UAV-based sensing tasks in environmental monitoring. This paper presents a mission planner of coverage sampling and path planning for a UAV-enabled mobile sensor to effectively explore and map an unknown environment that is modeled as a random field. The proposed planner can generate a coverage path with an optimal coverage density for exploratory sampling, and the associated energy cost is subjected to a power supply constraint. The performance of the developed framework is evaluated and compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms, using a real-world dataset that is collected from an environmental monitoring program as well as physical field experiments. The experimental results illustrate the reliability and accuracy of the presented coverage sampling planner in a prior survey for environmental exploration and field mapping.",60010365,The University of British Columbia,Vancouver,Canada,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.285714285714285,0.05555555555555555,0.4047619047619047,1

In particular, each user's device processes the visual and inertial data received from its sensors and almost immediately broadcasts a partial feature map of its surroundings. In parallel, every device localizes against the broadcasted maps by employing feature observations to determine its 4-DOF transformation to each of the gravity-aligned maps. By doing so, virtual content placed by any of the users is quickly and accurately displayed in all other users' views. Furthermore, to reduce the effect of inconsistency introduced by relocalizing against incrementally created and updated maps, their transformations w.r.t. the device are modeled as random processes driven by white noise instead of constant, unknown parameters. Lastly, we assess the accuracy of our approach for the case of two users in a room-scale environment against VICON ground-truth.",60006191,Google LLC,Mountain View,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.142857142857142,0.00535714285714286,0.2690476190476191,1

This paper presents a flexible Virtual Multi-View Synthesis module that can be adopted into 3D object detection methods to improve orientation estimation. The module uses a multi-step process to acquire the fine-grained semantic information required for accurate orientation estimation. First, the scene's point cloud is densified using a structure preserving depth completion algorithm and each point is colorized using its corresponding RGB pixel. Next, virtual cameras are placed around each object in the densified point cloud to generate novel viewpoints, which preserve the object's appearance. We show that this module greatly improves the orientation estimation on the challenging pedestrian class on the KITTI benchmark.

1304,1304,Can a Social Robot Encourage Children's Self-Study?,"This paper presents a robot behavioral model designed to support children during self-study. In particular, we want to investigate how a robot could increase the time children keep concentration. The behavioral model was developed by observing children during self-study and by collecting information from experienced tutors through interviews. After observing the children, we decided to consider three states corresponding to different levels of concentration. The child can be smoothly performing the task ('learning' state), encountering some difficulties ('stuck' state) or distracted ('distracted' state). The behavioral model was designed to increase the time spent concentrating on the task by implementing adequate behaviors for each of these three states. These behaviors were designed using the advices collected during the interview survey of the experienced tutors. A self-study system based on the proposed behavior model was implemented. In this system, a small robot sits on the table and encourages the child during self-study. An operator is in charge of determining the state of the child (Wizard of Oz) and the behavioral model triggers the appropriate behaviors for the different states. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed behavioral model, a user study was conducted: 22 children were asked to solve problems alone and to solve problems with the robot. The children spent significantly (p = 0.024) more time in the 'learning' state when studying with the robot.",60011001,Kyoto University,Kyoto,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",18.666666666666668,0.2517857142857143,0.4958333333333333,1

With the variability of operators' behaviors in such systems, the stability of an operator modeling technique, i.e., that a modeling approach produces similar results across repeated applications, is critical to the extensibility and utility of such a model. Using an unmanned vehicle simulation testbed where such vehicles can be hacked, we compared two operator behavioral models from two different experiments using a hidden Markov modeling (HMM) approach. The resulting HMM models revealed operators' dominant strategies when conducting hacking detection tasks. The similarity between these two models was measured via multiple aspects, including model structure, state distribution, divergence distance, and co-emission probability distance. The similarity measure results demonstrate the stability of modeling human operators in HSC scenarios using HMM models. These results indicate that even when operators perform differently on specific tasks, such an approach can reliably detect whether strategies change across different experiments.",60008724,Duke University,Durham,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.571428571428573,-0.017777777777777778,0.3705555555555555,1

Our result can be interpreted as ensuring that the receding horizon path performs no worse in expectation than a given sub-optimal search path. This result is especially practical for subsea applications where, due to use of side-scan sonar in search applications, search paths typically consist of parallel straight lines. Thus for subsea search applications, our approach ensures that expected performance is no worse than the usual subsea search path, and it might be much better.

Instead, the model self-organizes such representations at the level of a slow-varying latent layer, linking action branch and language branch at the center. We train the model in a bi-directional way, learning how to produce a sentence from a certain action sequence input and, simultaneously, how to generate an action sequence given a sentence as input. Furthermore we show this model preserves some of the generalization behaviour of Multiple Timescale Recurrent Neural Networks (MTRNN) in generating sentences and actions that were not explicitly trained. We compare this model with a number of different baseline models, confirming the importance of both the bi-directional training and the multiple timescales architecture.

Path planning relies on a map that contains free and occupied space information and is efficient to query, while the role of SLAM is to keep the map consistent as new measurements are continuously added. A key challenge, however, lies in ensuring a map representation compatible with both these objectives: that is, a map that maintains free space information for planning but can also adapt efficiently to dynamically changing pose estimates from a graph-based SLAM system.In this paper, we propose an online global occupancy map that can be corrected for accumulated drift efficiently based on incremental solutions from a sparse graph-based SLAM optimization.

1322,1322,Upper Limb Motion Simulation Algorithm for Prosthesis Prescription and Training,"A simulation algorithm to predict expected upper limb movements of prosthesis users performing activities of daily living (ADL) was developed. It is quite challenging to determine the right type and fit of a prosthesis and provide appropriate training to properly utilize it. The amputee care team typically uses prior experiences to provide prescription and training customized for each individual. It is also very difficult to anticipate expected and undesired compensatory motions due to reduced degrees of freedom of a prosthesis user. We have developed a tool to predict and visualize the expected upper limb movements resulting from using a prescribed prosthesis and its suitability to the needs of the amputee. It is expected to help clinicians make decisions such as the type of the prosthesis, and whether to include a wrist joint, based on the impact it will have on the rest of the joints. The main focus of this work is to use robotics-based methods to simulate human use of prostheses and identify the expected posture of the limited joints on the upper limbs. Unlike other works, this paper does not discuss the control of the prosthesis but the posture of the body. A weighted least-norm inverse kinematics algorithm was used to develop a robotics-based model of the upper limbs and torso. Motion capture data from the subjects were used to determine the weighting matrix the algorithm required. Results show that this approach provides human-like simulation of joint motions and matches the motion capture data. The algorithm uses the individual's anthropometrics and level of amputation to create a personalized kinematic model of the upper body and the joint motions during ADLs.

1323,1323,Online Trajectory Generation: Reactive Control with Return Inside an Admissible Kinematic Domain,"As humans and robots work more and more closely, robots must quickly react to unforeseen human behavior. Online Trajectory Generation (OTG), based on simple trajectory models like series of polynomial cubic functions, has demonstrated its efficiency to plan and control reactive motions of robots. However to ensure the safety and comfort of humans, fast trajectory adaptation algorithms are necessary to bring back the robot inside an acceptable domain that is defined by a set of kinematic constraints.The algorithm presented herein extends a time-optimal OTG to cope with non admissible robot's state. This feature enables time-variant kinematic constraints. With the possibility to specify velocity and acceleration at both ends under short computation times, it makes the robot able to react quickly to unforeseen events. Short computation times can lead to more refined architectures where sensors can be integrated to a low control level and make the system more reactive.",60005830,Laboratoire d'Analyse et d'Architecture des Systemes,Toulouse,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.666666666666668,0.22444444444444445,0.4388095238095238,1
1324,1324,Siamese Convolutional Neural Network for Sub-millimeter-accurate Camera Pose Estimation and Visual Servoing,"Visual Servoing (VS), where images taken from a camera typically attached to the robot end-effector are used to guide the robot motions, is an important technique to tackle robotic tasks that require a high level of accuracy. We propose a new neural network, based on a Siamese architecture, for highly accurate camera pose estimation. This, in turn, can be used as a final refinement step following a coarse VS or, if applied in an iterative manner, as a standalone VS on its own. The key feature of our neural network is that it outputs the relative pose between any pair of images, and does so with sub-millimeter accuracy. We show that our network can reduce pose estimation errors to 0.6 mm in translation and 0.4 degrees in rotation, from initial errors of 10 mm / 5 degrees if applied once, or of several cm / tens of degrees if applied iteratively. The network can generalize to similar objects, is robust against changing lighting conditions, and to partial occlusions (when used iteratively). The high accuracy achieved enables tackling low-tolerance assembly tasks downstream: using our network, an industrial robot can achieve 97.5% success rate on a VGA-connector insertion task without any force sensing mechanism.",60031307,School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.857142857142858,0.09419457735247208,0.4298883572567783,1

Yet, interpreting and anchoring perceptual data in a physically consistent estimation of the scene is a crucial ability for humans, and thus robots in HRI context.

With the aim of implementing the tactile device with improved functionality and wearability, we focus on designing the device to have two characteristics: multi-DOF force feedback displayability and large force capability with compact and lightweight structure. In designing the device, we mainly consider the type and configuration of actuator and driving mechanism, since both have a great effect on the size, weight, and output force of the device. As the actuator, we select the shape memory alloy exhibiting high energy density. And, as the driving mechanism, two different types of compliant mechanism are designed for two important functions: to convert contraction of the SMA to the desired motion as a motion guide and to apply bias-force to the SMA as a bias-spring. The device is designed as the miniature interface that can display 3-DOF pressure and 2-DOF shearing force to user's fingerpad. And, it is implemented as the functional prototype with the total weight of 26 g including actuators and all mechanical components.

1327,1327,Discrete N-Dimensional Entropy of Behavior: DNDEB,"Shared control for human-robot teams - where both the human and the robot's autonomy provide commands to the hardware - offers advantages over fully teleoperated or fully autonomous systems by utilizing the unique skill sets of both the human and robot's autonomy simultaneously. However, the mechanism by which control is shared is often static and many teams could benefit from adjusting this mechanism, such that the human or autonomy alternatively receive more control authority in different scenarios. The question then is: how do we know when these scenarios occur? In this paper, we present a method to estimate the performance of human-robot teams using a novel metric called Discrete N-Dimensional Entropy of Behavior (DNDEB). DNDEB utilizes knowledge of a high-performing human-robot team to build a model of how the team should operate. The model is used to predict the human's command. The error between the prediction and actual command is tracked and after a certain number of samples, entropy is estimated. A higher level of entropy corresponds to deviations from the high-performance model, which can be interpreted as poor performance by the human-robot team (e.g., long task time or a collision). Our formulation offers several advantages: it (1) accepts discrete inputs of any size, (2) does not require additional sensors, and (3) is tunable to the specific application. To validate this, we conduct a 15person study where subjects operated a powered wheelchair under three different shared-control paradigms. We find that entropy is higher for cases with longer task durations and cases where there is a collision. Moreover, we use DNDEB thresholds as a mechanism to predict the performance of the human-robot team online and find an average accuracy of 91% with a prescience rate of 72%.",60007363,Northwestern University,Evanston,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.0,0.10788690476190478,0.37068452380952377,1
1328,1328,Meta-Learning for Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning,"Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is the generalization of standard reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to solve sequential decision making problems that consist of several, possibly conflicting, objectives. Generally, in such formulations, there is no single optimal policy which optimizes all the objectives simultaneously, and instead, a number of policies has to be found each optimizing a preference of the objectives. In this paper, we introduce a novel MORL approach by training a meta-policy, a policy simultaneously trained with multiple tasks sampled from a task distribution, for a number of randomly sampled Markov decision processes (MDPs). In other words, the MORL is framed as a meta-learning problem, with the task distribution given by a distribution over the preferences. We demonstrate that such a formulation results in a better approximation of the Pareto optimal solutions in terms of both the optimality and the computational efficiency. We evaluated our method on obtaining Pareto optimal policies using a number of continuous control problems with high degrees of freedom.",60103653,Aalto University,Espoo,Finland,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",27.166666666666668,0.006428571428571428,0.3753896103896104,1

This paper describes novel techniques to minimize the volumetric size and/or step size of such motors in order to cope with the limited space requirements while still delivering high precision. Three designs are presented: the R-10 measures 1.0 cm3, has step size 12.9° and torque 1.2 N mm. The R-40 measures 25.6 cm3, has step size 1.01° and torque 470 N mm.

1330,1330,Robust Non-Rigid Point Set Registration Algorithm Considering Anisotropic Uncertainties Based on Coherent Point Drift,"Non-rigid point set registration (PSR) is an outstanding and fundamental problem in fields of robotics, computer vision, medical image analysis and imageguided surgery. The aim of a non-rigid registration problem is to align together two point sets that have been deformed. We have derived and presented a novel registration algorithm that non-rigidly registers two point sets together. The assumption of isotropic localization error is shared in the previous non-rigid registration algorithms. In this paper, the position localization error is generalized to the anisotropic cases, which means that the error distribution is not the same in different spatial directions. The motivation of considering the anisotropic characteristic is that the point localization error is actually different in three spatial directions in real applications. Mathematically, the difficulty in dealing with the anisotropic error case comes from the change from a standard deviation that is a scalar to a covariance matrix. The formulas for updating the parameters in both expectation and maximization steps are derived. In the expectation step, we compute the posterior probabilities that represent the correspondences between points in two PSs. In the maximization step, given the current posteriors, the covariance matrix of the position localization error and the non-rigid transformation are updated. To facilitate the proposed algorithm, the low-rank approximation variation of our method is also presented. We have demonstrated through experiments that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of registration and accuracy and robustness to noise. More specifically, most of the experimental results have passed the statistical tests at the 5% significance level.",60002798,Chinese University of Hong Kong,Shatin,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.692307692307693,0.11190476190476192,0.3523809523809524,1
1331,1331,Printing-while-moving: A new paradigm for large-scale robotic 3D Printing,"Building and Construction have recently become an exciting application ground for robotics. In particular, rapid progress in material formulation and in robotics technology has made robotic 3D Printing of concrete a promising technique for in-situ construction. Yet, scalability remains an important hurdle to widespread adoption: the printing systems (gantry-based or arm-based) are often much larger than the structure to be printed, hence cumbersome. Recently, a mobile printing system-A manipulator mounted on a mobile base - was proposed to alleviate this issue: such a system, by moving its base, can potentially print a structure larger than itself. However, the proposed system could only print while being stationary, imposing thereby a limit on the size of structures that can be printed in a single take. Here, we develop a system that implements the printing-while-moving paradigm, which enables printing single-piece structures of arbitrary sizes with a single robot. This development requires solving motion planning, localization, and motion control problems that are specific to mobile 3D Printing. We report our framework to address those problems, and demonstrate, for the first time, a printing-while-moving experiment, wherein a 210 cm × 45 cm × 10 cm concrete structure is printed by a robot arm that has a reach of 87 cm.",60119025,Singapore Centre for 3D Printing,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.625,-0.015532879818594102,0.5200113378684806,1

Originally developed for rocket landing applications, STCs are made up of a trigger condition and a constraint condition that are arranged such that satisfaction of the former implies satisfaction of the latter. Compound STCs go a step further by allowing multiple trigger and constraint conditions to be combined via Boolean 'and' or 'or' operations. The logical implications embodied by STCs can be formulated using continuous variables, and thus enable the incorporation of discrete decision making into a continuous optimization framework. In this paper, compound STCs are used to solve quad-rotor path planning problems that would typically require the use of computationally expensive mixed-integer programming techniques. Two scenarios are considered: (1) a quad-rotor flying through a hoop, and (2) a pair of quadrotors carrying a beam-like payload through an obstacle course. Successive convexification is used to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Monte-Carlo simulation results show that our approach can reliably generate trajectories at rates upwards of 3 and 1.5 Hz for the first and second scenarios, respectively.",60015481,"University of Washington, Seattle",Seattle,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.125,-0.06282051282051282,0.32179487179487176,1

Modeling of fracture and deformation during a cutting action, often based on the finite element method (FEM), provides the force and shape information used in knife control to implement a skill such as slice, chop, or dice. However, an object's 3D mesh model can be computationally prohibitive for achieving a desired accuracy since numerous tiny elements must be used near the knife's moving edge. To address this issue, we represent the object as evenly spaced slices normal to the cutting plane such that cutting of each slice requires only a 2D mesh.

Variable impedance mechanisms enable adaptable and robust interactions with the environment. This paper combines the advantages of both approaches through layer jamming. Thin sheets of complaint material are encased in an airtight envelope, and when connected to a vacuum, the bending stiffness and damping increase dramatically. Using layer jamming structures as flexure elements leads to mechanical systems that can actively vary stiffness and damping. This results in flexure mechanisms with the versatility to transition between degrees of freedom and degrees of constraint and to tune impact response.

A computer vision algorithm was developed to select the person, start the behaviors and monitor the response automatically. To vary the robot's enthusiasm when engaging passersby, a waving gesture was designed as basic welcoming behavioral element, which could be successively combined with an utterance and an approach movement. This way, three levels of enthusiasm were implemented: Mild (waving), moderate (waving and utterance) and high (waving, utterance and approach movement). The three levels of welcoming behaviors were tested with a Pepper robot at the entrance of a university building. We recorded data and observation sheets from several hundreds of passersby (N =364) and conducted post-interviews with randomly selected passersby (N =28).

The solver is designed for devices with significant computation and power constraints such as mobile phones or tablets. Two approaches have been combined in our design. The first is a graph pruning strategy by exploiting objective function structure to reduce the optimization problem size which further sparsifies the optimization problem. The second step is to accelerate each optimization iteration in solving increments for the gradient-based search in Gauss-Newton type optimization solver. We apply a modified Cholesky factorization and reuse the decomposition result from last iteration by using Cholesky update/downdate to accelerate the computation. We have implemented our solver and tested it with open source data.

On the other hand, if one were to save the entire set of paths connecting all pair of locations in the configuration space a priori, one would run out of memory very quickly. In this work, we introduce a novel way of producing fast and optimal motion plans for static environments by using a stepping neural network approach, called OracleNet. OracleNet uses Recurrent Neural Networks to determine end-to-end trajectories in an iterative manner that implicitly generates optimal motion plans with minimal loss in performance in a compact form.

This procedure can be repeated n times, with the same approximation to the derivative, obtaining new iterative methods of order p+2n.

The manipulator is composed of 4 improved hybrid active-passive linkage segments. Its short and long linkage cables with pretension mechanism are designed to keep equal angles of adjacent joints. An improved separable small driving control box is also designed with both quick release and load mechanism and stroke amplification mechanism. Then the size of control box can still remain small, even the number of segments and the joint limit angles increase. Considering the improved in-segment linkage characteristic, traditional kinematic equations and Jacobian matrix are greatly simplified with Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) method. Further trajectory tracking planning based on the simplified kinematics solved the Cartesian space planning for task design. Finally, a prototype system is developed to perform the linkage accuracy and comprehensive obstacle avoidance experiments. Experimental results show that the developed hybrid active and passive CDSM has relatively high accuracy and super dexterity.",60019616,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.272727272727273,0.14398550724637688,0.5451449275362319,1

It precludes the necessity for prohibitive analytic computation of the derivatives of the desired (virtual) attitude that is typically employed in controlling quadrotor systems. Moreover, this control scheme is approximation-free in the sense that it does not incorporate any adaptive laws, observers, or command filters to compensate for unknown parameters in the dynamics and the absence of the analytic differentiation, thus exhibiting remarkably low complexity levels and making its implementation straightforward. The thrust saturation is approached in the position control design which also enables the singularity in desired attitude extraction to be avoided entirely. It is demonstrated that based on the proposed scheme, the tracking errors can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately selecting design parameters. Extensive simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of our scheme.",60008691,University of Shanghai for Science and Technology,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.166666666666668,0.034583333333333334,0.39904761904761904,1

The system can match and exceed human speeds and confirms that users prefer human-level timing.The system has the appearance of a robot character, with a bear-like head and a soft anthropomorphic hand and uses Bézier curves to achieve smooth minimum-jerk motions. Fast timing is enabled by low latency motion capture and real-time trajectory generation: the robot initially moves towards an expected handover location and the trajectory is updated on-the-fly to converge smoothly to the actual handover location. A hybrid automaton provides robustness to failure and unexpected human actions.In a 3x3 user study, we vary the speed of the robot and add variable sensorimotor delays. We evaluate the social perception of the robot using the Robot Social Attribute Scale (RoSAS). Inclusion of a small delay, mimicking the delay of the human sensorimotor system, leads to an improvement in perceived qualities over both no delay and long delay conditions.

The robot has a 180mm body length, a maximum flapping amplitude of 60deg, and reaches a peak speed of 0.93 body length per second. In order to characterize its swimming kinematics and propulsive forces a special setup was built using an instrumented holder and high speed video. Experiments were conducted to characterize propulsive force generation with varying fin flapping frequencies (from 1hz to 2. 4hz), amplitudes, and wavelengths.

Therefore, we propose a method for avoiding the situation where a robot picks multiple objects. In our proposed method, first, grasping pose candidates are computed by using the graspability index. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to predict whether or not the robot can pick one and only one object from the bin. Additionally, since a physics simulator is used to collect data to train the CNN, an automatic picking system can be built.

Local pose optimization is performed by an attention-based neural network which iteratively refines the predicted pose estimates of an image snippet. Instead of complicated graph convolutional network, the attention mechanism based on geometric consistency of trajectory constraint is utilized because pose features whose spatial distribution is not important can be flattened to vectors and then processed. The pose optimizer is aimed at improving pose estimation accuracy by redistributing errors of pose estimates.

Then, pre-grasping manipulation like shifting or pushing an object becomes necessary. We developed an algorithm that can learn, in addition to grasping, to shift objects in such a way that their grasp probability increases. Our research contribution is threefold: First, we present an algorithm for learning the optimal pose of manipulation primitives like clamping or shifting. Second, we learn non-prehensible actions that explicitly increase the grasping probability. Making one skill (shifting) directly dependent on another (grasping) removes the need of sparse rewards, leading to more data-efficient learning. Third, we apply a real-world solution to the industrial task of bin picking, resulting in the ability to empty bins completely. The system is trained in a self-supervised manner with around 25 000 grasp and 2500 shift actions. Our robot is able to grasp and file objects with 274±3 picks per hour.

We propose a formalism for planning robot communication that employs a probabilistic representation of the robots world. This representation takes on the form of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and captures the uncertainty of interacting with humans. The key insight of this work is that humans preferences and time need to be carefully balanced against the robots in order to minimize human annoyance. The communication-MDP enables the robot to reason about the effects of its actions on a human interactor. We validated the model through a human subjects experiment (n=44) by learning communication policies for a loosely collaborative task.

This coupled approach addresses sub-optimality and incompleteness of the decoupled approach, but has not been widely used due to its excessive computational overhead. Given this trade-off space, we present a simple, yet effective mobile manipulation sampling method, harmonious sampling, to perform the coupled approach mainly in difficult regions, where we need to simultaneously maneuver the base and the manipulator. Our method identifies such difficult regions through a low-dimensional base space by utilizing a reachability map given the target end-effector pose and narrow passage detected by generalized Voronoi diagram. For the rest of simple regions, we perform sampling mainly on the base configurations with a predefined joint configuration, accelerating the planning process. We compare our method with the decoupled and coupled approaches in six different problems with varying difficulty. Our method shows meaningful improvements experimentally in terms of time to find an initial solution (up to 5.6 times faster) and final solution cost (up to 17% lower) over the decoupled approach, especially in difficult scenes with narrow space.

The proposed system relies on a Behavior Tree (BT) framework that combines the knowledge of EMS protocol guidelines with speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning methods to (i) extract critical information from responders' conversations and verbalized observations, (ii) infer the incident context, and (iii) decide on safe and effective response interventions to perform. We use a data-set of 8302 real EMS call records from an urban, high volume regional ambulance agency in the U.S. to evaluate the responsiveness and cognitive ability of the system and assess the safety of the suggestions provided to the responders.

A configuration space that includes both the position and velocity of static or dynamic elements within the field-of-view of the ASV is supporting a particle swarm optimization procedure that minimizes the risk of harm and the deviation towards a predefined course while generating a navigation path with capabilities to prevent potential collisions.Extensive experiments demonstrate the ability of AVOA to select a velocity estimative for ASVs that originates a smoother, safer and, at least, two times more effective collision-free path when compared to existing techniques.",60007249,Universidade do Porto,Porto,Portugal,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",49.0,0.20852272727272728,0.5211174242424244,1

Most current methods manually design the driving policy, which can be expensive to develop and maintain at scale. Instead, with imitation learning we only need to collect data and the computer will learn and improve the driving policy automatically. However, existing imitation learning methods for autonomous driving are hardly performing well for complex urban scenarios. Moreover, the safety is not guaranteed when we use a deep neural network policy. In this paper, we proposed a framework to learn the driving policy in urban scenarios efficiently given offline connected driving data, with a safety controller incorporated to guarantee safety at test time.

1377,1377,Dynamic Input for Deep Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving,"In many real-world decision making problems, reaching an optimal decision requires taking into account a variable number of objects around the agent. Autonomous driving is a domain in which this is especially relevant, since the number of cars surrounding the agent varies considerably over time and affects the optimal action to be taken. Classical methods that process object lists can deal with this requirement. However, to take advantage of recent high-performing methods based on deep reinforcement learning in modular pipelines, special architectures are necessary. For these, a number of options exist, but a thorough comparison of the different possibilities is missing. In this paper, we elaborate limitations of fully-connected neural networks and other established approaches like convolutional and recurrent neural networks in the context of reinforcement learning problems that have to deal with variable sized inputs. We employ the structure of Deep Sets in off-policy reinforcement learning for high-level decision making, highlight their capabilities to alleviate these limitations, and show that Deep Sets not only yield the best overall performance but also offer better generalization to unseen situations than the other approaches.",60025641,Universität Freiburg im Breisgau,Freiburg im Breisgau,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.0,0.18129251700680274,0.4748299319727891,1

This paper addresses this issue by presenting MaSTr1325, a marine semantic segmentation training dataset tailored for development of obstacle detection methods in small-sized coastal USVs. The dataset contains 1325 diverse images captured over a two year span with a real USV, covering a range of realistic conditions encountered in a coastal surveillance task. The images are per-pixel semantically labeled. The dataset exceeds previous attempts in this domain in size, scene complexity and domain realism.

In contrast with previous works, which formulate an entirely new hand-crafted optimization cost or trajectory generation algorithm for a different robot dynamic model, our framework is a general approach that is applicable to arbitrary robot models.

Therefore, intelligent hybrid vehicular systems must be aware of the interactions between humans and the environment (e.g., sound, vibration, speed, etc.). In this paper, we evaluate the effect of acoustic annoyance on drivers in a real-world driving study. We found significant differences in driving styles elicited by annoying acoustics and present an online classifier that uses onboard inertial measurement unit measurements to distinguish whether a driver is annoyed with 77% accuracy. Moreover, we directly measured the forces applied on the passenger with a pressure mat lined on the car seat, and empirically confirm that our proposed passenger dynamics model is reasonable. However, due to our acoustically induced driving styles not being polarizing enough, we were unable to show that passengers' self-reported ride comfort changed with acoustic annoyance.",60121438,Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences,Berkeley,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.166666666666668,0.11250000000000002,0.5249999999999999,1

The main idea is to increase the branching factor of the BVH according to the available SIMD registers and parallelize the simultaneous BVH traversal using SIMD operations. This requires a novel BVH construction method because traditional BVHs for collision detection usually are simple binary trees. To do that, we present a new BVH construction method based on a clustering algorithm, Batch Neural Gas, that is able to build efficient n-ary tree structures along with SIMD optimized simultaneous BVH traversal. Our results show that our new data structure outperforms binary trees significantly.",60008293,University of Bremen,Bremen,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.166666666666668,0.1081439393939394,0.38885281385281384,1
1382,1382,A Comparison of Visual Servoing from Features Velocity and Acceleration Interaction Models,"Visual Servoing has been widely investigated in the last decades as it provides a powerful strategy for robot control. Thanks to the direct feed-back from a set of sensors, it allows to reduce the impact of some modeling errors and to perform tasks even in uncertain environments. The commonly exploited approach in this field is to use a model that expresses the rate of change of a set of features as a function of sensor twist. These schemes are commonly used to obtain a velocity command, which needs to be tracked by a low-level controller. Another approach that can be exploited consists in going one step further and to consider an acceleration model for the features. This strategy allows also to obtain a natural and direct link with the dynamic model of the controlled system. This study aims at comparing the use of velocity and acceleration-based models in feed-back linearization for Visual Servoing. We consider the case of a redundant manipulator and discuss what this implies for both control techniques. By means of simulations, we show that controllers based on features acceleration give better results than those based on velocity in presence of noisy feedback signals.",60110511,Laboratoire des Sciences du Numérique de Nantes,Nantes,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.77777777777778,0.02666666666666667,0.34888888888888897,1

We propose an innovative, customizable six-axis force/torque sensor which can be clamped around a tool or end-effector to minimize the proximity between tool tip and sensor structure. The sensor is fabricated using 3d printing technology and consists of two pieces which together form an 8-legged Stewart platform. Each leg is designed as a cantilever beam to allow for a measurable displacement under an external load. The displacements of the legs are measured with 8 light intensity-based optoelectronic sensors, which exhibit high sensitivities and low noise levels without the need for external amplification circuitry. A customized printed circuit board and peripheral hardware are proposed to allow for efficient analog-to-digital conversion of the force/torque measurement. A calibration process is proposed which makes use ofa commercial ATI Mini40 sensor and custom hardware to allow for fast calibration routines. Finally, the calibrated sensor design is compared to the ATI Mini40 sensor by measuring sequences of forces and torques, and the maximum errors of force/torque components (F-{x},\ F-{y},\ F-{\mathrm{z}},\ M-{x},\ M-{y},\ M-{\mathrm{z}}) are 16.3%, 20.0%, 27.5%, 20.5%, 21.6%, 14.9% respectively.",60011520,King's College London,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.625,0.14535714285714282,0.49749999999999994,1

Timepix detectors are extremely small, but powerful 14 × 14 mm, 256 × 256 px CMOS hybrid pixel detectors, capable of measuring ionizing alpha, beta, gamma radiation, and heaving ions. The detectors, developed at CERN, produce an image free of any digital noise thanks to per-pixel calibration and signal digitization. Traces of individual ionizing particles passing through the sensors can be resolved in the detector images. Particle type and energy estimates can be extracted automatically using machine learning algorithms. This opens unique possibilities in the task of flexible radiation detection by very small unmanned robotic platforms. The detectors are well suited for the use of mobile robots thanks to their small size, lightweight, and minimal power consumption. This sensor is especially appealing for micro aerial vehicles due to their high maneuverability, which can increase the range and resolution of such novel sensory system.

A major goal of the research activities on MPs is to learn models, which can adapt to changing task constraints, e.g. new motion targets. However, the adaptability of current MPs is limited to a small set of constraints due to their simple structures. It is indeed not a trivial task to maintain the simplicity of MPs representation and, at the same time, enhance their adaptability.

We analyze the learned poses to determine what factors proper poses depend on. In addition to the poses, the configurations of the individual joints of the commercial robot are evaluated.

Furthermore, quality of the date fruits stored in the storage may degrade with time and it is important to inspect the quality of date routinely. After date harvesting, the industrial companies start the inspection of dates. Inspection of date fruit is to isolate the damaged or defected dates from the good one. Industrial factories demand a high quality and fast production that can only be achieved by automatic inspection. In this paper, we propose a framework for inspection of the external quality of the date fruits through the image processing method. Images of the date fruit are classified into good quality and sugar-defected by using bag of feature (BOF) method. The methodology includes five main stages including key points detection, feature extraction, creating a dictionary, vector quantization and classification.

1391,1391,Degeneracy-Aware Factors with Applications to Underwater SLAM,"Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is commonly formulated as an optimization over a graph. A popular approach is the pose graph, which seeks to solve for robots poses that are constrained by pose-to-pose measurements, such as odometry measurements or loop closures. For range sensors, these pose-to-pose constraints can be achieved by performing scan matching techniques, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP). However, in environments with insufficient or degenerate geometric features, the ICP solution can be unreliable and lead to significant drift in the trajectory of the graph optimization solution.In this paper, we propose a degeneracy-aware approach which has two stages: (1) a degeneracy-aware ICP algorithm and (2) a partially constrained loop closure factor to incorporate the results from (1) into the SLAM pose graph optimization. Our approach performs updates and optimizes both ICP and the pose graph in only the well constrained directions of the state space. These directions are selected on the basis of a dynamic threshold, which updates at each iteration. We apply the proposed algorithm to autonomous underwater mapping with sonar. To evaluate the performance of this algorithm, we conduct experiments in both simulation and real world scenarios, and show the method's robustness to navigational drift and ability to reject poor loop closures in degenerate environments, which would otherwise degrade the accuracy of the trajectory and the quality of the resulting map.",60104841,The Robotics Institute,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.125,0.002083333333333335,0.6118055555555556,1

Depending solely on the actuation of the mobile agents, this mobile robotic system can manipulate or position an end-effector. However, the complexity of the system due to presence of several mobile agents, passivity of the kinematic chain and the nature of the constrained collaborative manipulation requires development of an optimization framework. We therefore present an optimization framework for forward simulation and kinematic control of this system. With this optimization framework, the number of deployed mobile agents, actuation schemes, the design and morphology of the passive kinematic chain can be easily changed, which reinforces the modularity and collaborative aspects of the mobile robotic system.

With the advent of deep learning, depth prediction from a single RGB image has addressed these problems. However, as the predicted depth is typically noisy, de-noising methods such as TSDF fusion should be adapted for the accurate scene reconstruction. To integrate the two-step processing of depth prediction and TSDF generation, we design an RGB-to-TSDF network to directly predict 3D TSDF voxels from a single RGB image. The TSDF using our network can be generated more efficiently in terms of time and accuracy than the TSDF converted from depth prediction. We also use the predicted TSDF for a more accurate and robust camera pose estimation to complete scene reconstruction. The global TSDF is updated from TSDF prediction and pose estimation, and thus dense isosurface can be extracted. In the experiments, we evaluate our TSDF prediction and camera pose estimation results against the conventional method.",60120116,Automation and Systems Research Institute,Seoul,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.77777777777778,0.09841269841269844,0.36444444444444446,1

We propose a novel on-chip three-dimension (3D) cell rotation method using whirling flows generated by oscillating asymmetrical microstructures. In an acoustic field excited by the vibration of a piezoelectric transducer, two different modes of microvortices are generated around our custom-designed microstructures that are utilized to precisely achieve in-plane and out-of-plane rotational manipulation of microparticles and cells. The rotation mechanism is studied and verified using numerical simulations. We also investigate the effect of various parameters on the acoustically induced flows such as the frequency, the driving voltage and the distance from the microstructure tip to the oocyte center, thus indicating the rotational speed can be effectively tuned on demand for single-cell studies. Finally, by observing the maturation stages of M2 after excluding the first polar body of operated oocytes, the proposed method is proved noninvasive. Comparing with the conventional works, our acoustofluidic cell rotation approach is simple-to-fabricate and easy-to-operate, thereby allowing rotations irrespective of the physical properties of the specimen under investigation.",60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.571428571428573,0.11241496598639457,0.5220238095238094,1
1401,1401,Operational Space Control Framework for Torque Controlled Humanoid Robots with Joint Elasticity,"Torque controlled robots have the capability of implementing compliant behavior with back-drivability. In practice, however, joint elasticity often prevents an accurate position tracking performance of a robot. In particular, humanoid robots are influenced more by elasticity because of a long kinematic chain between the feet and hands. In this paper, we present a new inverse dynamics based control approach for torque controlled humanoid robots with joint elasticity. When formulating the operational space control framework, feedback control consists of only motor-related parts with measured motor angle values, and the link dynamics is compensated by the feedforward terms. The experiment results of the proposed approach show a noticeable improvement in the position tracking performance in 6-DoF manipulator. Finally, the proposed method was applied to a torque controlled biped robot for walking. Both stiff motion control of the CoM and compliant motion control of the foot were simultaneously achieved, demonstrating the advantage of the torque controlled robot.",60120480,Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology,Seoul,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.25,0.10430495430495433,0.5356902356902357,1

This paper proposes a novel concept of small-diameter multi-arm robot for SinglePort Access Surgery. The concept introduces a combination of backbone and actuation principles in a macro-micro fashion to achieve an excellent decoupling of the triangulation platform (macro) and of the end-effectors (micro). Concentric tube robots are used for the triangulation platform, while compliant fluidic-actuated bending segments are used as end-effectors. The fluidic actuation is advantageous as it minimally interferes with the triangulation platform. The triangulation platform on the other hand provides a stable base for the end-effectors such that large distal actuation bandwidth can be achieved. A specific embodiment for Spina Bifida repair is developed and proposed. The surgical and technical requirements as well as the mechanical design are presented in details.

1403,1403,Sim-to-Real Transfer for Biped Locomotion,"We present a new approach for transfer of dynamic robot control policies such as biped locomotion from simulation to real hardware. Key to our approach is to perform system identification of the model parameters mu of the hardware (e.g. friction, center-of-mass) in two distinct stages, before policy learning (pre-sysID) and after policy learning (post-sysID). Pre-sysID begins by collecting trajectories from the physical hardware based on a set of generic motion sequences. Because the trajectories may not be related to the task of interest, pre-sysID does not attempt to accurately identify the true value of mu, but only to approximate the range of mu to guide the policy learning. Next, a Projected Universal Policy (PUP) is created by simultaneously training a network that projects mu to a low-dimensional latent variable eta and a family of policies that are conditioned on eta. The second round of system identification (post-sysID) is then carried out by deploying the PUP on the robot hardware using task-relevant trajectories. We use Bayesian Optimization to determine the values for eta that optimize the performance of PUP on the real hardware. We have used this approach to create three successful biped locomotion controllers (walk forward, walk backwards, walk sideways) on the Darwin OP2 robot.",60019647,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.77777777777778,0.08681818181818181,0.3898701298701298,1

For 3D scene reconstruction in a single shot, usually two different catadioptric cameras are needed. More cameras may contribute to better reconstruction while larger mounting space and higher power cost are required. In this paper, a single camera multi-stereo catadioptric system with vertical and horizontal baseline structure is proposed. It features achieving multi-pair of central or non-central omnidirectional stereos in a compact manner. To make the 3D reconstruction process general and adaptive to various types of system configurations, a flexible calibration and reconstruction algorithm pipeline is presented. The algorithm features approximating the system into multiple central sub-cameras and carrying out the stereo matching in a spherical representation. In addition, an effective 3D point cloud fusion algorithm is proposed to optimize the reconstruction results from multiple stereo pairs.

The framework has been extensively tested on bathymetric maps from both simulation and several actual industrial surveys and has proved robustness over different types of terrain.

1406,1406,Force Field-Based Indirect Manipulation of UAV Flight Trajectories,"For a variety of applications remote navigation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) along a flight trajectory is an essential task. For instance, during search and rescue missions in outdoor scenes, an important goal is to ensure safe navigation. Assessed by the remote operator, this could mean avoiding collisions with obstacles, but moreover avoiding hazardous flight areas. State of the art approaches enable navigation along trajectories, but do not allow for indirect manipulation during motion. In addition, they suggest to use egocentric views which could limit understanding of the remote scene. With this work we introduce a novel indirect manipulation method, based on gravitational law, to recover safe navigation in the presence of hazardous flight areas. The indirect character of our method supports manipulation at far distances where common direct manipulation methods typically fail. We combine it with an immersive exocentric view to improve understanding of the scene. We designed three flavors of our method and compared them during a user study in a simulated scene.

The method is implemented on an in-house developed hyper-redundant (11-DOF) surgical robotic forceps prototype. This surgical robot is composed of two modules with a 7-DOF Kuka IIWA manipulator for performing 4-DOF Remote Centre of Motion (RCM) about the trocar and an articulated 4-DOF parallel wrist/gripper mechanism attached to the distal end of the Kuka robot for intra-corporeal manipulation. The hybrid sensor-based/sensorless method fuses torque estimates from the parallel wrist mechanism with measurements from a force sensor attached between the wrist base and the Kuka tool frame. With this approach it is possible to obtain force/torque estimates on all Cartesian axes (x, y, z, yaw, pitch, roll) of the forceps tip. The prototype is one of the first systems designed for robotic surgery that can achieve accurate force estimation on all 6 axes of the instrument tip.

In these unstructured scenarios, it is possible that the body of the robot collides with its surroundings. As such, it would be desirable to characterise these contacts in terms of their location and interaction forces. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and isolating collisions between a robotic manipulator and its environment, using only on-board joint torque and position sensing. The algorithm is based on a particle filter and, under some assumptions, is able to identify the contact location anywhere on the robot body. It requires the robot to perform small exploratory movements, progressively integrating the new sensing information through a Bayesian framework. The approach was tested and benchmarked in simulation, with respect to its accuracy and robustness.

It invites many intriguing, unsolved problems at the intersection of aesthetical and scientific challenges. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning agent which supervises motion planning of a filming drone by making desirable shot mode selections based on aesthetical values of video shots. Unlike most of the current state-of-the-art approaches that require explicit guidance by a human expert, our drone learns how to make favorable viewpoint selections by experience. We propose a learning scheme that exploits aesthetical features of retrospective shots in order to extract a desirable policy for better prospective shots. We train our agent in realistic AirSim simulations using both a hand-crafted reward function as well as reward from direct human input. We then deploy the same agent on a real DJI M210 drone in order to test the generalization capability of our approach to real world conditions.

1412,1412,Passive Inverted Ultra-Short Baseline (piUSBL) Localization: An Experimental Evaluation of Accuracy,"The underwater environment poses significant challenges for accurate autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation. Electromagnetic (EM) waves rapidly attenuate due to absorption by water, thereby preventing the use of traditional EM-based positioning methods such as Global Positioning System (GPS) or visible-light cameras. Consequently, underwater positioning is often performed using systems that operate in the hydro-acoustic frequency range (\leq 10 MHz). Recent work has demonstrated the efficacy of a novel acoustic positioning approach for multi-AUV operations called passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) localization-with each vehicle equipped with a time-synchronized USBL array, one-way travel-time (OWTT) range and angle between the AUV and a single acoustic beacon enables multi-AUV navigation relative to the beacon. In this work, a piUSBL system using a five-hydrophone pyramidal array implemented on a WAM-V autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) was used to experimentally gather acoustic measurements and to compare the accuracy of piUSBL localization against ground-truth from a differential GPS unit. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the positioning accuracy of the system in a real-world environment, both prior to and after Bayesian filtering, using two independent acoustic beacons for validation. We demonstrate that piUSBL provides acoustic range and angle measurements with errors of about \mu\pm\sigma = 0.03\pm 1.49 \mathrm{m} and \mu\pm\sigma = -0.11\pm 3.16{\circ} respectively. These experimental results suggest that piUSBL localization can provide a highly accurate, inexpensive, and low-power navigation solution for the next generation of miniature, low-cost underwater vehicle.",60022195,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",29.125,0.10992063492063496,0.3697751322751323,1

In our previous work [1], we have demonstrated that twisted string actuators can be used to transmit power even at significant deflection angles of the conduit. However, several undesirable effects, namely pull-back, hysteresis, and chattering, were present during actuation due to friction between strings and the internal sheath of the conduit. This paper reports the results of experimental study on effects of vibration on twisted string actuation inside deflected conduits. We have demonstrated that applying vibration generated near natural frequency of the system during the later stages of twisting and untwisting cycles helped reduce pull-back and hysteresis and increase string contraction. In case when sheath was deflected by 180° under a constant load of 3 kg, we were able to achieve over 70% decrease in pull-back and 30% decrease in hysteresis, compared with no vibration case.",60105869,Innopolis University,Kazan,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.5,-0.028541666666666667,0.44468750000000007,1

IoT applications concurrently generate the huge amount of data that need to be handled. In this paper, an optimal mechanism is proposed to handle big data for decision making. Based on the classical decision-making process in the field of Big Data, we design an adaptive knowledge-based method through IoT application. A Bayesian network model is used to manage knowledge formation in all direction for the decision-making process. Knowledge of Bayesian networks is habitually emitted as an optimal solution, where the analysis job is to locate a formation that exploits a statistically motivated score. Generally, accessible knowledge tools deal with this optimal solution by means of ordinary search methods. As it required big amount of data space, therefore it is a time consuming procedure that should be avoided. The situation becomes decisive once big data involve in searching for optimal solution. An algorithm is introduced to accomplish faster processing of optimal solution by limiting the search data space. The proposed recursive algorithm will limit the search space. The result shows that the optimal mechanism of the decision process is able to handle big data by reducing processing time, computational complexity and a higher percentage of prediction rates.",60031886,Universiti Kuala Lumpur,Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,['1700'],17.666666666666668,0.12708333333333335,0.3541666666666667,0
1415,1415,Detecting and Characterizing Arab Spammers Campaigns in Twitter," Published by Elsevier B.V.Social media platforms play a significant role in today's society as billions of users use them to share or seek information on a regular basis. The content in social media has a significant impact that influences individuals' opinions and decision, which can range from buying a small product to voting for a political campaign. This role has been fueling the interest in utilizing social media content for research and commercial purposes. The significant role of social media also attracted other individuals who intentionally abuse or misuse these platforms by producing and managing a tremendous amount of fake accounts to perform various malicious activities. Their activities are often center on sharing unwanted, misleading, or harmful content to either send unwanted ads, manipulate public opinion, or spread harmful malware. This act would eventually reduce the quality of social media content as a mean of information source used for various purposes. Therefore, this research proposes a machine-learning based model that aims to detect malicious users and groups on Twitter. We have, in particular, focus on malicious Arab accounts as it has not been sufficiently researched. The proposed model adopts a semi-supervised technique that labels Twitter accounts based on their behavior and profile information into spam or genuine account. To evaluate this technique, we collected a dataset through a Twitter API by targeting active Arab users. We manually labeled approximately 500 accounts as the ground truth, and then, we developed a classification model with a set of redefined features with the aim of identifying individual and groups of spam accounts. We have also evaluated the performance of the proposed model, and the results show that our model achieves 0.89 F measure: 0.89 and 0.91 Accuracy.",60004582,King Abdulaziz University,Jeddah,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],23.75,0.0175,0.41724358974358977,0
1416,1416,Learning Local Feature Descriptor with Motion Attribute for Vision-based Localization,"In recent years, camera-based localization has been widely used for robotic applications, and most proposed algorithms rely on local features extracted from recorded images. For better performance, the features used for open-loop localization are required to be short-term globally static, and the ones used for re-localization or loop closure detection need to be long-term static. Therefore, the motion attribute of a local feature point could be exploited to improve localization performance, e.g., the feature points extracted from moving persons or vehicles can be excluded from these systems due to their unsteadiness. In this paper, we design a fully convolutional network (FCN), named MD-Net, to perform motion attribute estimation and feature description simultaneously. MD-Net has a shared backbone network to extract features from the input image and two network branches to complete each sub-task. With MD-Net, we can obtain the motion attribute while avoiding increasing much more computation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can learn distinct local feature descriptor along with motion attribute only using an FCN, by outperforming competing methods by a wide margin. We also show that the proposed algorithm can be integrated into a vision-based localization algorithm to improve estimation accuracy significantly.",60118460,Alibaba Group Holding Limited,Yu Hang,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.5,0.1638888888888889,0.43888888888888894,1

1418,1418,A Novel Semi-Autonomous Control Framework for Retina Confocal Endomicroscopy Scanning,"In this paper, a novel semi-autonomous control framework is presented for enabling probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) scan of the retinal tissue. With pCLE, retinal layers such as nerve fiber layer (NFL) and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) can be scanned and characterized in real-time for an improved diagnosis and surgical outcome prediction. However, the limited field of view of the pCLE system and the micron-scale optimal focus distance of the probe, which are in the order of physiological hand tremor, act as barriers to successful manual scan of retinal tissue.Therefore, a novel sensorless framework is proposed for real-time semi-autonomous endomicroscopy scanning during retinal surgery. The framework consists of the Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER) integrated with a pCLE system, where the motion of the probe is controlled semi-autonomously. Through a hybrid motion control strategy, the system autonomously controls the confocal probe to optimize the sharpness and quality of the pCLE images, while providing the surgeon with the ability to scan the tissue in a tremor-free manner. Effectiveness of the proposed architecture is validated through experimental evaluations as well as a user study involving 9 participants. It is shown through statistical analyses that the proposed framework can reduce the work load experienced by the users in a statistically-significant manner, while also enhancing their performance in retaining pCLE images with optimized quality.",60015891,Wilmer Eye Institute,Baltimore,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",31.285714285714285,0.3297619047619048,0.5988095238095238,1
1419,1419,Inferring Distributions over Depth from a Single Image,"When building a geometric scene understanding system for autonomous vehicles, it is crucial to know when the system might fail. Most contemporary approaches cast the problem as depth regression, whose output is a depth value for each pixel. Such approaches cannot diagnose when failures might occur. One attractive alternative is a deep Bayesian network, which captures uncertainty in both model parameters and ambiguous sensor measurements. However, estimating uncertainties is often slow and the distributions are often limited to be uni-modal. In this paper, we recast the continuous problem of depth regression as discrete binary classification, whose output is an un-normalized distribution over possible depths for each pixel. Such output allows one to reliably and efficiently capture multi-modal depth distributions in ambiguous cases, such as depth discontinuities and reflective surfaces. Results on standard benchmarks show that our method produces accurate depth predictions and significantly better uncertainty estimations than prior art while running near real-time. Finally, by making use of uncertainties of the predicted distribution, we significantly reduce streak-like artifacts and improves accuracy as well as memory efficiency in 3D map reconstruction.

In circumstances where only acoustic signals can be obtained, estimating the geometry of a room is a challenging proposition. Existing methods have been proposed to reconstruct a room from the room impulse responses (RIRs). However, the sound source and microphones must be deployed in a feasible region of the room for it to work, which is impractical when the room is unknown. This work propose to employ a robot equipped with a sound source and four acoustic sensors, to follow a proposed path planning strategy to moves around the room to collect first image sources for room geometry estimation. The strategy can effectively drives the robot from a random initial location through the room so that the room geometry is guaranteed to be revealed.

The filter is made adaptive such that there is no need to tune the covariance matrix for the disturbance estimation. Furthermore, whereas most model-based control approaches require the linearization of the system dynamics, our method is nonlinear which means that no linearization is required.

1422,1422,Relaxing the Conservatism of Passivity Condition for Impedance Controlled Series Elastic Actuators,"This paper proposes a practical and less conservative passivity analysis for series elastic actuators (SEAs) by introducing load port definition and shows that the achievable stiffness by the impedance control of SEA can be set higher than the inherent stiffness of SEA depending on the condition of the load dynamics. Since SEA can inherently measure or estimate a transmitted force thanks to its embedded spring element, impedance control is often exploited to render compliant behaviors related between the motion and the force. Although the stability of the SEA control system is of great importance, the conventional passivity analysis gives conservative criteria, and indeed limits the actual actuator performance. To tackle the conservatism of the conventional passivity in SEAs, we first explore the dynamic characteristics of SEA including load dynamics, which has been ignored for the sake of simplicity of the passivity analysis by excluding uncertain load dynamics. The inclusion of the load dynamics into the passivity analysis allows us to properly derive the less conservative limit of achievable stiffness by impedance control and the factors that determine the limit. The proposed analysis is verified by numerical simulations and applied to a passivity observer design for experimental validation on an actual SEA setup.",60102151,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia,Genoa,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",33.666666666666664,0.07006802721088437,0.2784013605442177,1
1423,1423,Laminated foam-based soft actuator for actuatable flexible structure,"Recently, in the search for alternatives to conventional robots, various types of soft actuators and their applications have been studied. In particular, pneumatic soft actuators have the advantage of being lightweight and high power. One of the uses of these soft actuators is as a substitute for an electric motor to actuate the joint of a structure, such as a link mechanism. Another use involves their fusion with a flexible structure. The features of this concept are a simplified system, in which almost all interfaces can be configured as flexible structures. However, because these actuatable flexible structures are made with rubber, silicone, or flexible resin, it is difficult for them to support their own weight owing to the effect of the square-cube law in the case of increasing size. Hence, these structures are limited to a size of approximately 1 \times 10^{-2}-1 \times 10^{-1} \mathrm{m}. If an actuatable flexible structure with a size of 1 \times 10^{0} m can be realized, the concept of soft actuator-flexible structure fusion is expected to provide novel solutions and applications. Herein, as a feasibility study, large actuatable flexible structures were developed. The proposed structure, LayerCAKE, is a laminated open-cell and closed-cell foam structure; cell foam is a lightweight and flexible material that can be used to realize large actuatable flexible structures. LayerCAKE is actuated by using the concept that open- and closed-cell foams contract differently when they are vacuumed. The bending-motion model and was experimentally verified, and different types of LayerCAKE models that could exhibit various types of motion were developed and tested. Furthermore, a complex-shaped LayerCAKE model (in the shape of a human hand) was developed. A large actuatable flexible structure of approximately 900 mm was realized. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the bending motion could be controlled by pressure.",60015336,Chuo University,Hachioji,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.8,0.03983579638752052,0.46582922824302136,1
1424,1424,Deep Neural Network Approach in Electrical Impedance Tomography-based Real-time Soft Tactile Sensor,"Recently, a whole-body tactile sensing have emerged in robotics for safe human-robot interaction. A key issue in the whole-body tactile sensing is ensuring large-area manufacturability and high durability. To fulfill these requirements, a reconstruction method called electrical impedance tomography (EIT) was adopted in large-area tactile sensing. This method maps voltage measurements to conductivity distribution using only a few number of measurement electrodes. A common approach for the mapping is using a linearized model derived from the Maxwell's equation. This linearized model shows fast computation time and moderate robustness against measurement noise but reconstruction accuracy is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear EIT algorithm through Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach to improve the reconstruction accuracy of EIT-based tactile sensors. The neural network architecture with rectified linear unit (ReLU) function ensured extremely low computational time (0.002 seconds) and nonlinear network structure which provides superior measurement accuracy. The DNN model was trained with dataset synthesized in simulation environment. To achieve the robustness against measurement noise, the training proceeded with additive Gaussian noise that estimated through actual measurement noise. For real sensor application, the trained DNN model was transferred to a conductive fabric-based soft tactile sensor. For validation, the reconstruction error and noise robustness were mainly compared using conventional linearized model and proposed approach in simulation environment. As a demonstration, the tactile sensor equipped with the trained DNN model is presented for a contact force estimation.",60032144,Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology,Yusong,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",18.076923076923077,0.07291005291005292,0.46518518518518526,1

Further, since our method is based on simple dynamics, it is conceptually simple to understand and allows one to interpret the predictions produced, as well as to extract a cost function that can be used for planning. The main difference between our method and similar systems, is that we employ a map of the space and translate the motion of groups of paths into vector fields on that map.

1427,1427,Web Data Extraction Approach for Deep Web using WEIDJ," Published by Elsevier B.V.Data extraction is one of the most prominent areas in data mining analysis that is been extensively studied especially in the field of data requirements and reservoir. The main aim of data extraction with regards to semi-structured data is to retrieve beneficial information from the World Wide Web. The data from large web data also known as deep web is retrievable but it requires request through form submission because it cannot be performed by any search engines. Data mining applications and automatic data extraction are very cumbersome due to the diverse structure of web pages. Most of the previous data extraction techniques were dealing with various data types such as text, audio, video and etc. but research works that are focusing on image as data are still lacking. Document Object Model (DOM) is an example of the state of the art of data extraction technique that is related to research work in mining image data. DOM was the method used to solve semi-structured data extraction from web. However, as the HTML documents start to grow larger, it has been found that the process of data extraction has been plagued with lengthy processing time and noisy information. In this research work, we propose an improved model namely Wrapper Extraction of Image using DOM and JSON (WEIDJ) in response to the promising results of mining in a higher volume of web data from a various types of image format and taking the consideration of web data extraction from deep web. To observe the efficiency of the proposed model, we compare the performance of data extraction by different level of page extraction with existing methods such as VIBS, MDR, DEPTA and VIDE.

1428,1428,Neural Control with an Artificial Hormone System for Energy-Efficient Compliant Terrain Locomotion and Adaptation of Walking Robots,"In order to use walking robots for exploration in a real complex environment, an adaptive control system is required to allow them to successfully and efficiently traverse the terrains. To achieve this, we propose here our adaptive locomotion control technique of a walking robot. It is based on a modular structure, combining neural control with an artificial hormone system. The neural control coordinates all leg joints of the robot and generates its locomotion with various insect-like gaits. In parallel, the artificial hormone system uses the motor commands from the neural control and foot contact feedback to estimate the walking state and automatically adapt the joint movements with respect to the terrain. The adaptability is quickly achieved in an online manner within a few seconds. Robot walking experiments show that this adaptive control technique enables a six-legged robot to adapt to various difficult terrains with energy efficiency. Such terrains include sand (loose ground), sponge with different softness levels (soft/compliant ground), grass (vegetated ground), and floor/pavement (hard ground). The technique does not require robot kinematics or an environmental model; and can, therefore, be potentially applied to different legged robots to achieve stable online adaptation and energy-efficient locomotion on unpredictable (compliant) terrains.",60110787,Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology,Rayong,Thailand,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.11111111111111,-0.10599547511312217,0.6271116138763196,1

1433,1433,Stochastic Sampling Simulation for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction,"Urban environments pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) as they must safely navigate while in close proximity to many pedestrians. It is crucial for the AV to correctly understand and predict the future trajectories of pedestrians to avoid collision and plan a safe path. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promising results in accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories, relying on large amounts of annotated real-world data to learn pedestrian behavior. However, collecting and annotating these large real-world pedestrian datasets is costly in both time and labor. This paper describes a novel method using a stochastic sampling-based simulation to train DNNs for pedestrian trajectory prediction with social interaction. Our novel simulation method can generate vast amounts of automatically-annotated, realistic, and naturalistic synthetic pedestrian trajectories based on small amounts of real annotation. We then use such synthetic trajectories to train an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art deep learning approach Social GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to perform pedestrian trajectory prediction. Our proposed architecture, trained only using synthetic trajectories, achieves better prediction results compared to those trained on human-annotated real-world data using the same network.

Moodle, currently become one of the leading learning management system that deliver e-learning easily by providing customized tool for educators to deploy learning materials in various forms. The students behavior is important to be identified in order for educators to improve the teaching approach and to enhance the students performances. However, the flexibility in the learning environment cause student behaviour more challenging to be identified. In Moodle, the student's interactions and activities while learning online are captured in the log files. The data stored in the log files contain meaningful information such as the student behavior, their preferences and their knowledge level. In this study, the raw dataset captured in the log file undergo pre-processing phase such as data cleaning, transformation and selection to prepare the dataset for the analysis purposes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that is known for improvement of accuracy for unsupervised learning technique is used to identify the most significant features of students attributes from the log file. Course view, notes, exercises, examples and assignments are the features selected using PCA to be feed into Self-Organizing Map (SOM) in order to cluster students based on the behavior. The result shows that the technique is able to cluster the student browsing behavior using the total number of browsing frequency in 14 weeks study session, which form two cluster groups; high browsing behavior and low browsing behavior.

1435,1435,Towards Explainable Shared Control using Augmented Reality,"Shared control plays a pivotal role in establishing effective human-robot interactions. Traditional control-sharing methods strive to complement a human's capabilities at safely completing a task, and thereby rely on users forming a mental model of the expected robot behaviour. However, these methods can often bewilder or frustrate users whenever their actions do not elicit the intended system response, forming a misalignment between the respective internal models of the robot and human. To resolve this model misalignment, we introduce Explainable Shared Control as a paradigm in which assistance and information feedback are jointly considered. Augmented reality is presented as an integral component of this paradigm, by visually unveiling the robot's inner workings to human operators. Explainable Shared Control is instantiated and tested for assistive navigation in a setup involving a robotic wheelchair and a Microsoft HoloLens with add-on eye tracking. Experimental results indicate that the introduced paradigm facilitates transparent assistance by improving recovery times from adverse events associated with model misalignment.",60015150,Imperial College London,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.857142857142858,0.09333333333333332,0.3077777777777778,1

We formulate planar PGO as the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) on the product of unit complex numbers, and relax this nonconvex quadratic complex optimization problem to complex semidefinite programming (SDP). Furthermore, we simplify the corresponding semidefinite programming to Riemannian staircase optimization (RSO) on complex oblique manifolds that can be solved with the Riemannian trust region (RTR) method. In addition, we prove that the SDP relaxation and RSO simplification are tight as long as the noise magnitude is below a certain threshold. The efficacy of this work is validated through comparisons with existing methods as well as applications on planar PGO in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which indicates that the proposed algorithm is capable of solving planar PGO certifiably, and is more efficient in numerical computation and more robust to measurement noises than existing state-of-the-art methods.

With the design principle to construct the architecture for robots to execute complex tasks compounded with multiple subtasks, this study proposes a visuomotor-control framework with the characteristics of a state machine to train shorter tasks as sensorimotor units.

1440,1440,Communication constrained cloud-based long-term visual localization in real time,"Visual localization is one of the primary capabilities for mobile robots. Long-term visual localization in real time is particularly challenging, in which the robot is required to efficiently localize itself using visual data where appearance may change significantly over time. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based visual localization system targeting at long-term localization in real time. On the robot, we employ two estimators to achieve accurate and real-time performance. One is a sliding-window based visual inertial odometry, which integrates constraints from consecutive observations and self-motion measurements, as well as the constraints induced by localization results from the cloud. This estimator builds a local visual submap as the virtual observation which is then sent to the cloud as new localization constraints. The other one is a delayed state Extended Kalman Filter to fuse the pose of the robot localized from the cloud, the local odometry and the high-frequency inertial measurements. On the cloud, we propose a longer sliding-window based localization method to aggregate the virtual observations for larger field of view, leading to more robust alignment between virtual observations and the map. Under this architecture, the robot can achieve drift-free and real-time localization using onboard resources even in a network with limited bandwidth, high latency and existence of package loss, which enables the autonomous navigation in real-world environment.

However, there is a rising concern about the robustness of these systems because of their susceptibility to adversarial attacks on DNNs. Past research has established that DNNs used for classification and object detection are prone to attacks causing targeted misclassification. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of an adversarial dynamic attack on an end-to-end trained DNN controlling an autonomous vehicle. We launch the attack by installing a billboard on the roadside and displaying videos to approaching vehicles to cause the DNN controller in the vehicle to generate steering commands that cause, for example, unintended lane changes or motion off the road causing accidents. The billboard has an integrated camera estimating the pose of the on-coming vehicle. The approach enables dynamic adversarial perturbation that adapts to the relative pose of the vehicle and uses the dynamics of the vehicle to steer it along adversary-chosen trajectories while being robust to variations in view, lighting, and weather. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack on a recently published off-the-shelf end-to-end learning-based autonomous navigation system in a high-fidelity simulator, CARLA (CAR Learning to Act).

However, they often get stuck in local optima depending on the quality of the initial solution and consequently, often do not find a valid (i.e. collision free) trajectory. Moreover, they often require fine tuning of a cost function to obtain the desired motions. In this paper, we address both problems by combining local trajectory optimisation with learning from demonstrations. The human expert demonstrates how to reach different target end-effector locations in different ways. From these demonstrations, we estimate a trajectory distribution, represented by a Probabilistic Movement Primitive (ProMP). For a new target location, we sample different trajectories from the ProMP and use these trajectories as initial solutions for the local optimisation. As the ProMP generates versatile initial solutions for the optimisation, the chance of finding poor local minima is significantly reduced. Moreover, the learned trajectory distribution is used to specify the smoothness costs for the optimisation, resulting in solutions of similar shape as the demonstrations.

Our framework combines the efficiency of traditional geometric methods with robustness of deep learning methods, consisting of two stages: At stage -1, our accelerated cluster proposal algorithm will generate refined cluster proposals by segmenting point clouds without ground, capable of generating less redundant proposals with higher recall in an extremely short time; stage -2 we will amplify and further process these proposals by a neural network to estimate semantic label for each point and meanwhile propose a novel data augmentation method to enhance the network's recognition capability for all categories especially for non-rigid objects. Evaluated on KITTI raw dataset, PASS3D stands out against the state-of-the-art on some results, making itself competent to 3D perception in autonomous driving system.

1445,1445,Toward Achieving Formal Guarantees for Human-Aware Controllers in Human-Robot Interactions,"With the primary objective of human-robot interaction being to support humans' goals, there exists a need to formally synthesize robot controllers that can provide the desired service. Synthesis techniques have the benefit of providing formal guarantees for specification satisfaction. There is potential to apply these techniques for devising robot controllers whose specifications are coupled with human needs. This paper explores the use of formal methods to construct human-aware robot controllers to support the productivity requirements of humans. We tackle these types of scenarios via human workload-informed models and reactive synthesis. This strategy allows us to synthesize controllers that fulfill formal specifications that are expressed as linear temporal logic formulas. We present a case study in which we reason about a work delivery and pickup task such that the robot increases worker productivity, but not stress induced by high work backlog. We demonstrate our controller using the Toyota HSR, a mobile manipulator robot. The results demonstrate the realization of a robust robot controller that is guaranteed to properly reason and react in collaborative tasks with human partners.",60013372,The University of Texas at Austin,Austin,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.555555555555557,0.05600000000000001,0.30400000000000005,1
1446,1446,Jointly Learnable Behavior and Trajectory Planning for Self-Driving Vehicles,"The motion planners used in self-driving vehicles need to generate trajectories that are safe, comfortable, and obey the traffic rules. This is usually achieved by two modules: behavior planner, which handles high-level decisions and produces a coarse trajectory, and trajectory planner that generates a smooth, feasible trajectory for the duration of the planning horizon. These planners, however, are typically developed separately, and changes in the behavior planner might affect the trajectory planner in unexpected ways. Furthermore, the final trajectory outputted by the trajectory planner might differ significantly from the one generated by the behavior planner, as they do not share the same objective. In this paper, we propose a jointly learnable behavior and trajectory planner. Unlike most existing learnable motion planners that address either only behavior planning, or use an uninterpretable neural network to represent the entire logic from sensors to driving commands, our approach features an interpretable cost function on top of perception, prediction and vehicle dynamics, and a joint learning algorithm that learns a shared cost function employed by our behavior and trajectory components. Experiments on real-world self-driving data demonstrate that jointly learned planner performs significantly better in terms of both similarity to human driving and other safety metrics, compared to baselines that do not adopt joint behavior and trajectory learning.",60110521,Uber Technologies Inc,San Francisco,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",30.428571428571427,0.16666666666666666,0.5305555555555554,1

The feasible application of a tool, such as pulling a nail with a hammer claw, requires careful coordination of the choice of grasp and joint trajectories to ensure kinematic and force limits are not exceeded - in the grasp as well as the robot mechanism. In this paper, we formulate this type of problem as choosing the values of decision variables in the presence of various constraints. We evaluate the impact of the various constraints in some representative instances of tool use. To aid others in further investigating this class of problems, we have released materials such as printable tool models and experimental data.

1448,1448,Accelerating the Construction of Boundaries of Feasibility in Three Classes of Robot Design Problems,"This paper aims to improve the practical scalability of automated tools to assist in designing robots. Such problems rapidly become intractable because the underlying design space is immense. We consider a specific type of design tool addressed in prior work, which constructs a representation of the destructiveness boundary in the space of robot designs. This prior work showed that a legible representation, specifically a decision tree, of this boundary can illuminate which elements of a sensing or actuation system are most important for enabling the robot to complete its task. In that context, the robot's interaction with the world is represented as procrustean graph, and the space of robot designs is represented by the space of label maps that rewrite the labels on that graph. In this paper, we expand upon those results by showing how domain knowledge can enable such tools to find solutions to more complex problems within a reasonable time frame. Specifically, we propose three different scenarios, expressed as constraints on the p-graph and on the label maps, under which the learning algorithm to identify the destructiveness boundary can converge quickly to high accuracy results for problems at larger scales than the prior, general-purpose algorithm. The conditions for each of these scenarios are easily verifiable and the set of problems that fall under each is rich enough to encompass several interesting problems.

1449,1449,The Era of Artificial Intelligence in Malaysian Higher Education: Impact and Challenges in Tangible Mixed-Reality Learning System toward Self Exploration Education (SEE)," Published by Elsevier B.V.Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the creation of a smart machine that has human behaviour and response. AI in the education sector is able to interact, assist, and guide students through Self-Exploration Education (SEE) in Self Determined Learning (SDL) or Heutagogical technique, such as current, but semi-automatic learning systems. Malaysian higher education institutions are forced to adapt to such a radical change in order to stay competitive and fulfill their stakeholder needs. Everyone is born as a genius, with curiosity to explore the environment through experiments. This study examines the effect of SDL on SEE in Tangible Mixed-Reality Learning System until 2030. It does that under two different lenses: First, the effect on the value proposition and the business models of the SDL. Second, it identifies hurdles for the implementation and draws strategic implications for the SDL Tangible Mixed-Reality Learning System. However, in practice, SEE is still very much focused on spreading facts rather than encouraging personal exploration. Conducting exploration of learning in the classroom can be complicated for adult learning or andragogy and is limited by virtue, money and work infrastructure. But what if we can create a middle ground between learning and fiction, the world in which adults learn and explore in ways that may be impossible in real life but still true to the transfer of knowledge? The project is to craft an imaginative and accessible tool to help adults develop scientific minds and practices through self-exploration or Do-it-yourself DIY with a mixed reality learning system that empowers adults to know the invisible and investigate hard through exploration. By 2030 the likeliest scenario is that fully Self-Exploration is solely available for particularly high-value use cases, affecting the value proposition toward provision of education services, an increase of stakeholder and value-centric value propositions fostered by continuous interactions between the Heutagogical technique and the stakeholder.",60103919,Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin,Kuala Terengganu,Malaysia,['1700'],28.09090909090909,0.07062271062271062,0.42130952380952374,0

Semantic 3D maps, as a carrier of the environmental knowledge, are then intensively studied for their abilities and applications. However, it is still challenging to produce a dense outdoor semantic map from a monocular image stream. Motivated by this target, in this paper, we propose a method for large-scale 3D reconstruction from consecutive monocular images. First, with the correlation of underlying information between depth and semantic prediction, a novel multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed for joint prediction. Given a single image, the network learns low-level information with a shared encoder and separately predicts with decoders containing additional Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) layers and the residual connection which merits disparities and semantic mutually. To overcome the inconsistency of monocular depth prediction for reconstruction, post-processing steps with the superpixelization and the effective 3D representation approach are obtained to give the final semantic map. Experiments are compared with other methods on both semantic labeling and depth prediction. We also qualitatively demonstrate the map reconstructed from large-scale, difficult monocular image sequences to prove the effectiveness and superiority.",60021182,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.0,0.1211309523809524,0.6185515873015873,1
1451,1451,Reactive Interaction Through Body Motion and the Phase-State-Machine,"Between humans, body motion is an intuitive and ubiquitous means to coordinate interactions, but so far collaborative robots have not embraced this mode of communication. One reason for this is that conventional behavior generation systems use finite state machines which make it exceptionally difficult to ingest and produce the inherently continuous and concurrent information flow that body motion provides. We propose a new, reactive motion generator based on a dynamical system instead. It mimics a conventional state machine except that transitions are not instantaneous but time-extended, reversible, and have phases. Moreover, consecutive states and transitions may overlap during execution. Most notably, more than one transition can be active at the same time if they share predecessor state. Together, these unique features enable instantaneous and gradual responses to novel information and continuous decision processes without changing the state graph itself. We demonstrate the system's capabilities in an object handover task coordinated by body motion.",60011604,Technical University of Berlin,Berlin,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.125,0.06923160173160174,0.5893831168831168,1

Multi-view constraints on the object shape are obtained by detecting objects and extracting category-specific keypoints and segmentation masks.

The trained control policies are very robust to external disturbances and can withstand harsh initial conditions such as throws.

Prior work on robotic liquid pouring has primarily focused on visual techniques for sensing liquids, but these techniques fall short when liquids are obscured by opaque or closed containers. This paper proposes a complementary method for liquid perception via haptic sensing. The robot moves a container through a series of tilting motions and observes the wrenches induced at the manipulator's wrist by the liquid's shifting center of mass. That data is then analyzed with a physics-based model to estimate the liquid's mass and volume. In experiments, this method achieves error margins of less than lg and 2mL for an unknown liquid in a 600mL cylindrical container.

Training data are incrementally clustered into different linear subspaces and used to fit a low dimensional representation of each subspace. By considering the learned constraint subspaces as zeroing barrier functions, we are able to design a control input that keeps the system trajectory within the learned bounds.

Direct three-dimensional (3D) mapping using a small-sized UAV equipped with a laser scanner is required for numerous remote sensing applications. In direct 3D mapping, the precise information about the position and attitude of the UAV is necessary for constructing 3D maps. In this study, we propose a novel and robust technique for estimating the position and attitude of small-sized UAVs by employing multiple low-cost and light-weight global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antennas/receivers. Using the 'redundancy'' of multiple GNSS receivers, we enhance the performance of real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS by employing single-frequency GNSS receivers. This method consists of two approaches: hybrid GNSS fix solutions and consistency examination of the GNSS signal strength. The fix rate of RTK-GNSS using single-frequency GNSS receivers can be highly enhanced to combine multiple RTK-GNSS to fix solutions in the multiple antennas. In addition, positioning accuracy and fix rate can be further enhanced to detect multipath signals by using multiple GNSS antennas. In this study, we developed a prototype UAV that is equipped with six GNSS antennas /receivers. From the static test results, we conclude that the proposed technique can enhance the accuracy of the position and attitude estimation in multipath environments. From the flight test, the proposed system could generate a 3D map with an accuracy of 5 cm.",60032407,Chiba Institute of Technology,Narashino,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.363636363636363,0.05578947368421053,0.3494736842105263,1

Numerous methods exist today that can leverage these models to make robots perform tasks, either by directly exploiting the model structure or by accessing the model via a simulation. In this work, we explore how robots can use demonstrations to quickly build descriptive models of objects for manipulation tasks. Our framework uses demonstrations to incrementally build task-relevant geometric and physics-based object models that can be used to build simulations of the world that the robot is interacting with. We present experiments that involve estimating geometric features of an object when demonstration data from a user interacting with the object is available. We also demonstrate our method on the task of toppling a box with a 7-DoF manipulator equipped with a palm at its end.

Reduced order models (ROMs), i.e. actuated Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (aSLIP) models and Hybrid-Linear Inverted Pendulum (H-LIP) models, are utilized for motion generation on the desired center of mass (COM) dynamics for each type of planar motion. The periodic motion is planned via point foot (underactuated) ROMs for dynamic motion with minimum ankle actuation, while the transitional motion is planned via foot-actuated ROMs for fast and smooth transition. Composition of the planar COM dynamics yields the desired COM dynamics in 3D, which is embedded on the humanoid via control Lyapunov function based Quadratic programs (CLF-QPs). Additionally, the ground reaction force profiles of the aSLIP walking are used as desired references for ground contact forces in the CLF-QPs for smooth domain transitions.

The main motivation is to enhance the tracking performance of RISE controller at high dynamic operating conditions. RISE control law ensures a semi-global asymptotic tracking without introducing severe restrictions on the uncertain and nonlinearly parametrized systems. More nonlinearities are added to the original RISE control law by replacing the static feedback gains with nonlinear ones which depend on the system state variables. The proposed contribution is implemented in real-time experiments on a non-redundant three-degrees-of-freedom parallel manipulator named Delta.

1472,1472,Unsupervised Traffic Accident Detection in First-Person Videos,"Recognizing abnormal events such as traffic violations and accidents in natural driving scenes is essential for successful autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. However, most work on video anomaly detection suffers from two crucial drawbacks. First, they assume cameras are fixed and videos have static backgrounds, which is reasonable for surveillance applications but not for vehicle-mounted cameras. Second, they pose the problem as one-class classification, relying on arduously hand-labeled training datasets that limit recognition to anomaly categories that have been explicitly trained. This paper proposes an unsupervised approach for traffic accident detection in first-person (dashboard-mounted camera) videos. Our major novelty is to detect anomalies by predicting the future locations of traffic participants and then monitoring the prediction accuracy and consistency metrics with three different strategies. We evaluate our approach using a new dataset of diverse traffic accidents, AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), as well as another publicly-available dataset. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art.

In this study, we applied data mining techniques to analyze the traffic accident data pertaining to Dubai for the year 2017. The data for analysis is obtained from the official open data portal of United Arab Emirates. Apriori algorithm has been employed to mine frequent itemsets. Studies have been conducted to identify the major causes and trends associated with road accidents. Further experiments have been carried out to analyze the major causes of accidents during peak accident times and weekdays/weekends. It has been observed that majority of accidents involve vehicle hitting another vehicle due to inadequate space between vehicles. Another finding was that youth were involved in the majority of accidents. The results show that accidents' peak time was during late night and that the majority of drivers were found to be intoxicated. Studies conducted show that during weekend's peak accident time, majority of the drivers were intoxicated, while during weekday's peak accident time, the maximum number of accidents occurred due to lack of enough space between vehicles.

1474,1474,Simultaneous Drone Localisation and Wind Turbine Model Fitting during Autonomous Surface Inspection,"We present a method for simultaneous localisation and wind turbine model fitting for a drone performing an automated surface inspection. We use a skeletal parameterisation of the turbine that can be easily integrated into a non-linear least squares optimiser, combined with a pose graph representation of the drone's 3-D trajectory, allowing us to optimise both sets of parameters simultaneously. Given images from an onboard camera, we use a CNN to infer projections of the skeletal model, enabling correspondence constraints to be established through a cost function. This is then coupled with GPS/IMU measurements taken at key frames in the graph to allow successive optimisation as the drone navigates around the turbine. We present two variants of the cost function, one based on traditional 2D point correspondences and the other on direct image interpolation within the inferred projections. Results from experiments on simulated and real-world data show that simultaneous optimisation provides improvements to localisation over only optimising the pose and that combined use of both cost functions proves most effective.",60020650,University of Bristol,Bristol,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.166666666666668,0.1544871794871795,0.5044871794871795,1

We present a novel decentralized approach which alternates gradient-free stochastic optimization and a frontier-based approach. Our method allows each robot to generate its trajectory based on the collected data and the local map built integrating the information shared by its teammates. Whenever a local optimum is reached, which corresponds to a location surrounded by already explored areas, the algorithm identifies the closest frontier to get over it and restarts the local optimization. Its low computational cost, the capability to deal with constraints and the decentralized decision-making make it particularly suitable for multi-robot applications in complex 3D environments. Simulation results show that our approach generates feasible trajectories which drive multiple robots to completely explore realistic environments. Furthermore, in terms of exploration time, our algorithm significantly outperforms a standard solution based on closest frontier points while providing similar performances compared to a computationally more expensive centralized greedy solution.",60108197,Centre d'Innovation en Télécommunications et Intégration de Services,Villeurbanne,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.142857142857142,0.08774509803921568,0.36225490196078436,1

Existing approaches in modeling human driving behaviors including driver-model-based approaches and heuristic approaches have issues in either model accuracy or scalability limitation to new situations. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new inverse model predictive control (IMPC) based approach to model longitudinal human driving behaviors.

1477,1477,Using Emotion Analysis to Define Human Factors of Virtual Reality Wearables," Published by Elsevier B.V.Virtual Reality (VR) is a rapidly evolving technology which is using widely in different areas of our life. The VR wearable devices manufacturing has been significantly grown those days, the performance and quality have reached an incredible level of improvement. Developing technologies for human use such as VR wearable devices, must taking in the account not only the technical specifications, but also the Human Factors (HF) which involves people and technology must be considered to improve the level of user's acceptance. There are many approaches to define HF for any product based on user impression about that product such as questionnaires, surveys or interviews, but these methods could be extremely peripheral and poor methods because of unfair questions and answers, respondents truthful and the difficulties on finding users actual emotion. Thus, emotion could be considered as an affective component in the user opinion about a product and then in the human factors. This paper proposed an adaptive multi-label classification model (HF-EMA) based on supervised learning method, to predict five human factors from users' tweets (wearability, usability, safety, satisfaction and aesthetics) and to analyze and classify users' emotion regarding those factors into four emotions (Happy, Sad, Anger and Love). The experimental results proved the validity of the proposed model in predicting and classification process, it was given competitive results in predicting human factors from users tweets and then measure the users' emotion regarding those factors, with an average of ROC = 1, naïve base classifiers outperform the other classifiers.

1478,1478,Autonomous Steering of Concentric Tube Robots for Enhanced Force/Velocity Manipulability,"Concentric tube robots (CTR) can traverse tightly curved paths and offer dexterity in constrained environments, making them advantageous for minimally invasive surgical scenarios that experience strict anatomical and surgical constraints. Their shape is controlled via rotation and translation of several concentrically arranged super-elastic precurved tubes that form the robot backbone. As the elastic energy accumulated in the backbone due to bending and twist of the tubes increases, robots can exhibit sudden snapping motions, which can damage the surrounding tissues. In this paper, we proposed an approach for closed-loop steering of a redundant CTR that allows for snap-free motion and enhances its force/velocity manipulability, increasing the capacity of the robot to move and/or exercise forces along any direction. First, a controller stabilizes the CTR end-effector on a desired time-variant trajectory. Next, an online optimizer uses the robot's redundant Degrees of Freedom (DoF) to reshape its manipulability in real-time and steer it away from potentially snapping configurations or increase its capacity in delivering force payloads. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed control strategy. The controller can steer a generally unstable CTR along trajectories while avoiding instabilities with a mean error of 850\mum, corresponding to 0.6% of arclength, and improves robot ability to exercise forces by 55%.",60027272,University of Edinburgh,Edinburgh,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.875,-0.06800595238095238,0.3901289682539682,1

The main purpose of this work is to improve the performance of the latest solutions with no decrease in accuracy. To this end, we introduce the Double Refinement Network architecture.

1480,1480,Precise Correntropy-based 3D Object Modelling with Geometrical Traffic Prior,"Robust 3D perception using LiDAR is of prime importance for robotics, and its fundamental core lies in precise object modelling resisting to noise and outliers. In this paper, a precise 3D object modelling algorithm is designed especially for the intelligent vehicles. The proposed algorithm is advantageous by leveraging the crucial traffic geometrical prior of road surface profile, and both the noise and outliers are elegantly handled by robust correntropy-based metric. More specifically, the road surface correction (RSC) method transforms each individual LiDAR measurement from its locally planar road surface to a globally ideal plane. This procedure essentially guarantees the reduction of vehicle's motion from arbitrary 3D motion to physically feasible 2D motion. To deal with the noise and outliers, a correntropy-based multi-frame matching (CorrMM) algorithm is proposed which has a robust objective function with respect to point-to-plane residual error. An efficient solver inspired by M-estimator and retraction technique on Lie group is developed, which elegantly converts the optimization of highly non-linear objective function into a simple quadratic programming (QP) problem.

1481,1481,Analysis and Exploitation of Synchronized Parallel Executions in Behavior Trees,"Behavior Trees (BTs) are becoming a popular tool to model the behaviors of autonomous agents in the computer game and the robotics industry. One of the key advantages of BTs lies in their composability, where complex behaviors can be built by composing simpler ones. The parallel composition is the one with the highest potential since the complexity of composing pre-existing behaviors in parallel is much lower than the one needed using classical control architectures as finite state machines. However, the parallel composition is rarely used due to the underlying concurrency problems that are similar to the ones faced in concurrent programming. In this paper, we define two synchronization techniques to tackle the concurrency problems in BTs compositions and we show how to exploit them to improve behavior predictability. Also, we introduce measures to assess execution performance and we show how design choices can affect them.

The minimal modeling is for two reasons: i) we provide a systematic and intuitive way to encode domain knowledge for LCARS and ii) LCARS automatically constructs a probabilistic estimation model from the domain knowledge.

1483,1483,High-dimensional Motion Segmentation by Variational Autoencoder and Gaussian Processes,"Humans perceive continuous high-dimensional information by dividing it into significant segments such as words and units of motion. We believe that such unsupervised segmentation is also important for robots to learn topics such as language and motion. To this end, we previously proposed a hierarchical Dirichlet process-Gaussian process-hidden semi-Markov model (HDP-GP-HSMM). However, an important drawback to this model is that it cannot divide high-dimensional time-series data. Further, low-dimensional features must be extracted in advance. Segmentation largely depends on the design of features, and it is difficult to design effective features, especially in the case of high-dimensional data. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a hierarchical Dirichlet process-variational autoencoder-Gaussian process-hidden semi-Markov model (HVGH). The parameters of the proposed HVGH are estimated through a mutual learning loop of the variational autoencoder and our previously proposed HDP-GP-HSMM. Hence, HVGH can extract features from high-dimensional time-series data, while simultaneously dividing it into segments in an unsupervised manner. In an experiment, we used various motion-capture data to show that our proposed model estimates the correct number of classes and more accurate segments than baseline methods.

Researchers has already trained different artificial neural networks to predict steering angle with front-facing camera data stream. However, existing end-to-end methods only consider the spatiotemporal relation on a single layer and lack the ability of extracting future spatiotemporal information. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end driving model based on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) neural network with a Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Integration (MSI) module, which aiming to encode the spatiotemporal information from different scales for steering angle prediction. Moreover, we employ future sequential information to enhance spatiotemporal features of the end-to-end driving model. We demonstrate the efficiency of proposed end-to-end driving model on the public Udacity dataset with comparison of some existing methods.

This paper presents variable gait in a simulation and results from a hardware prototype for gravity-driven rolling ball mechanism in a previously proposed bipedal design. First, optimal control inputs that produce a range of variable feasible gaits is generated on a simplified under-actuated planar model. Then, a tray-like mechanism that provides a curved path for a ball to roll on is presented. This mechanism is designed to replicate a notion of pelvic shift, described in Bartenieff Fundamentals, with movement of the ball (which is shaped by the tray) creating a shift of weight. Analysis of two gait styles and two tray designs shows comparable ranges of forces in the direction of travel between the simulated planar model and the hardware mechanism.

1487,1487,Precision Modeling and Optimally-safe Design of Quadcopters for Controlled Crash Landing in Case of Rotor Failure,"The seminal work cited in [1],[2] showed, for the first time, that flight stability of quadcopters would be possible in case of one or even multiple rotor failures. However, the quadcopter can remain airborne only by going through a spinning maneuver about an axis, fixed w.r.t the vehicle (i.e., resolved yaw). Furthermore, positional control can be achieved by periodically tilting this axis. This paper builds upon this concept with two major improvements: (1) introducing a precise aerodynamic model of propellers that takes the flapping torque due to unbalanced lifting force in the advancing and retreating blades subjected to freestream, into account, and (2) adding to the stability and flight efficiency of the quadcopter by introducing symmetric fixed tilting angles to the trust vectors. In our previous work [3], it was shown how the flight stability and energy efficiency can be improved by introducing fixed tilting angles in the thrust vectors. For controlled crash landing in case of one rotor failure, where a resolved yaw maneuver would be inevitable, introducing a titling angle in rotors can generate a reasonable resolved-rate-yaw spinning speed to keep the quadcopter airborne at a lower rotational speed of the blades by taking advantage of the freestream generated by spinning. This tilting angle would also lead to passive stability in yaw motion of the quadcopter before the failure.

Accordingly, for learning a new task, time could be saved by restricting the parameter search space by initializing it with the solution of a similar task. We present a framework which is able of such knowledge transfer from already learned movement skills to a new learning task. The framework combines probabilistic movement primitives with descriptions of their effects for skill representation. New skills are first initialized with parameters inferred from related movement primitives and thereafter adapted to the new task through relative entropy policy search. We compare two different transfer approaches to initialize the search space distribution with data of known skills with a similar effect. We show the different benefits of the two knowledge transfer approaches on an object pushing task for a simulated 3-DOF robot.

The proposed solution is based on extracting system logs from a set of internal variables of a robotic system, on transforming such data into images, and on training different Autoencoder architectures to classify robot behaviors to detect anomalies.

1493,1493,Cable-Driven 4-DOF Upper Limb Rehabilitation Robot,"This paper developed a 4-degree-of-freedom cable-driven upper limb rehabilitation robot and proposed a control algorithm of the passive training for this robot. Comparing with the conventional cable-driven rehabilitation robot, the workspace of this robot is increased by optimizing the distribution of the cable attachment points and by improving the mechanical design. The rotation structure of the upper arm module can change the distribution of the attachment points as needed, by which the cable tension planner can be satisfied in almost all cases. At the meantime, the internal/external rotation of shoulder joint can be achieved without the change of the cables configuration, which is also important for increasing the workspace and comfortability of utilization. The activities of daily living (ADLs) training can be achieved well without any manual adjustment. The related controller for passive training is designed, which includes a higher controller for trajectory tracking and a lower controller for keeping cable tension as the output of the tension planner in real-time. The passive training experiments are conducted on five healthy subjects of different body size. The results demonstrated that the passive training can be achieved well on different subjects and the cable tension controller is also working effectively.",60005244,"Southeast University, Nanjing",Nanjing,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.75,0.1697802197802198,0.46593406593406583,1

In this paper we present an augmented reality user interface for controlling a smart wheelchair with a head-mounted display to provide assistance for mobility restricted people. Our motivation is to reduce the cognitive requirements needed to control a smart wheelchair. A key element of our platform is the ability to control the smart wheelchair using the concepts of affordances and signifiers. In addition to the technical details of our platform, we present a baseline study by evaluating our platform through user-trials of able-bodied individuals and two different affordances: 1) Door Go Through and 2) People Approach. To present these affordances to the user, we evaluated fixed symbol based signifiers versus our novel dynamic signifiers in terms of ease to understand the suggested actions and its relation with the objects. Our results show a clear preference for dynamic signifiers. In addition, we show that the task load reported by participants is lower when controlling the smart wheelchair with our augmented reality user interface compared to using the joystick, which is consistent with their qualitative answers.",60015150,Imperial College London,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.875,0.13721804511278196,0.4243734335839599,1

In this paper, we present experimental investigations on such microfluidic mixing with four different shapes of trapezoidal obstacles and tested them in a 1000-fold span of Reynolds number (Re). The obstacles have four different base ratios 1, 3, 6 and 9, which indicate the ratios between the upper and lower bases of a trapezoid. Two different dyes, yellow and blue, were used for visualizing and evaluating the performance of mixing. The results show that, when the base ratio is 1, the mixing surprisingly becomes worse with the increase of the flowrate. When the ratio is 3 or 6, the mixing performance is first reduced with the increase of Re and then went through a transition around Re of 10 before it rapidly increases. When the ratio is 9, two transition points were found around Re of 10 and 100, respectively.

A Legged, Multi-Vectored Water-Jet Composite Propulsion Mechanism (LMVWCPM) is designed with four legs, one of which contains three connecting rod parts, one water-jet thruster and three joints driven by digital servos. Using this mechanism, the robot is able to walk like amphibious turtles on various terrains and swim flexibly in submarine environment. A simplified kinematic model is established to analyze crawling gaits. With simulation of the crawling gait, the driving torques of different joints contributed to the choice of servos and the size of links of legs. Then we also modeled the robot in water and proposed several underwater locomotion. In order to assess the performance of the proposed robot, a series of experiments were carried out in the lab pool and on flat ground using the prototype robot.

Thus, one of the central focuses of developing AVs is to ensure safety during navigation. However, in reality, AV safety has been far below its expectation, and so far, no government has allowed for complete autonomous driving without human supervision. This paper proposes a dynamic safe path planning algorithm for AVs with Gaussian process regulated risk map. By reasonably assuming that the output of the object detection and tracking module follows a multi-variate Gaussian distribution, we put forward a safe path planning paradigm with Gaussian process regulated risk map, ensuring safety with high confidence.

We present a wearable robot, called MantisBot Alpha, that consists of two expandable robotic arms that brace a worker near the ground and allows them to perform bi-manual tasks. The key component of this new design is a novel linkage mechanism that provides adjustment of both the worker's distance to the ground and their torso tilt. The mechanism link parameters are optimized such that a) its expansion rate is high enough to push off the human body from the ground and fully contract the scissor arm when not used, and b) it allows the worker to reach within a large space while c) it is light enough for wearability. The linkage mechanism also avoids the singularity problem in standard scissor mechanisms. The actuator design provides a fail-safe system.

1499,1499,Ankle Torque during Mid-Stance Does Not Lower Energy Requirements of Steady Gaits,"In this paper, we investigate whether applying ankle torques during mid-stance can be a more effective way to reduce energetic cost of locomotion than actuating leg length alone. Ankles are useful in human gaits for many reasons including static balancing. In this work, we specifically avoid the heel-strike and toe-off benefits to investigate whether the progression of the center of pressure from heel-to-toe during mid-stance, or some other approach, is beneficial in and of itself. We use an Ankle Actuated Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum model to simulate the shifting center of pressure dynamics, and trajectory optimization is applied to find limit cycles that minimize cost of transport. The results show that, for the vast majority of gaits, ankle torques do not affect cost of transport. Ankles reduce the cost of transport during a narrow band of gaits at the transition from grounded running to aerial running. This suggests that applying ankle torque during mid-stance of a steady gait is not a directly beneficial strategy, but is most likely a path between beneficial heel-strikes and toe-offs.",60013402,Oregon State University,Corvallis,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.0,0.18697916666666667,0.47968750000000004,1

In this paper we propose a method for planning locomotion with multiple controllers and sub-planners, explicitly considering the multi-objective nature of the legged locomotion planning problem. The planner first obtains body paths extended with a choice of controller or sub-planner, and then fills the gaps by sub-planning. The method leads to paths with a mix of static and dynamic walking which only plan footsteps where necessary. We show that our approach is faster than pure footstep planning methods both in computation (2x) and mission time (1.4x), and safer than pure dynamic-walking methods. In addition, we propose two methods for aggregating the multiple objectives in search-based planning and reach desirable trade-offs without weight tuning. We show that they reach desirable Pareto-optimal solutions up to 8x faster than fairly-tuned traditional weighted-sum methods. Our conclusions are drawn from a combination of planning, physics simulation, and real robot experiments.",60026851,University of Oxford,Oxford,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.5,0.10604395604395604,0.5115384615384615,1

Our system mainly consists of a virtual LiDAR and a pose tracker. We use a perspective transformation method to synthesize a surroundview image from undistorted fisheye camera images. With a semantic segmentation model, the free space can be extracted. The scans of the virtual LiDAR are generated by discretizing the contours of the free space. As for the pose tracker, we propose a visual odometry system fusing both the feature matching and the virtual LiDAR scan matching results. Only those feature points located in the free space area are utilized to ensure the 2D-2D matching for pose estimation. Furthermore, bundle adjustment (BA) is performed to minimize the feature points reprojection error and scan matching error. We apply our system to an autonomous vehicle equipped with four fisheye cameras. The testing scenarios include an outdoor parking lot as well as an indoor garage. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves a more robust and accurate performance comparing with a fisheye camera based monocular visual odometry system.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",16.363636363636363,0.2261904761904762,0.4761904761904763,1

The floor plan need not be a precision map-it can be the sort of image found in buildings to guide people or aid evacuation. The core idea is to identify features that are stable across both a drawn floor plan and robot point-of-view LIDAR data, for example wall intersections, which appear as corners from overhead and as vertical lines from the ground. We introduce a factor graph-based global localization method that uses these features as landmarks. The detections of such descriptorless features are noisy and often ambiguous. We therefore propose robust data association based on a pairwise measurement consistency check and maxmixtures error model. We evaluate the resulting system in a real-world indoor environment, demonstrating performance comparable to a baseline system that uses a conventional LIDAR-based prior map.",60025778,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Ann Arbor,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.857142857142858,-0.03869047619047619,0.25297619047619047,1
1504,1504,Visual Domain Adaptation Exploiting Confidence-Samples,"Domain adaptation methods are used to address a problem, in which train scenario (source domain) and test scenario (target domain) are different. The existing methods mainly perform adaptation via reducing domain discrepancy from the view of a probability distribution. However, the idea of probability distribution matching always leads to a complex optimization process. Thereby these methods are difficult to apply in some scenario like online application or fast perception in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a new and simple domain adaptation method that utilizes confidence- samples to facilitate the classifier training on the target domain. Here, the confidence-samples are a subset of the target samples, and they have very credibly predicted labels. In order to detect the samples, a Category Similarity Collaborative Representation (CSCR) is first developed, by which the raw labels of all target samples are predicted using the smallest projection error according to the law of category. After this, the confidence score of the raw predicted labels is evaluated by the energy context information of CSCR. Finally, the target samples with a high confidence score are selected. Because of the linearity of CSCR, our method avoids complex optimization for matching the probability distribution.

The dynamic model of a compliant biped robot is extended with the implementation of semielliptical feet, to mimic human rollingradius progression during a step. The process of modeling the semielliptical foot shape and integrating its kinematics to the biped's dynamics is presented in detail. The passive dynamic behavior of the biped for elliptic feet of various dimensions is investigated through numerical simulations to provide results about gait stability, walking speed, energetic efficiency, and impact force levels. The concept of energetic efficiency in passive walking is discussed thoroughly, and an efficiency comparison methodology is proposed. Finally, it is shown that the biomimetically-inspired semielliptical foot profile can lead to higher gait efficiency. The results of this study can be used to optimize energetic efficiency in biped walking machines and/or gait assisting prosthetic equipment by means of foot shape optimization.",60014264,Universität Duisburg-Essen,Essen,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.142857142857142,0.175,0.41,1

For wheeled robots equipped with camera/lidar along with wheel encoders, calibration entails learning the motion model of the sensor or the robot in terms of the data from the encoders and generally carried out before performing tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This work puts forward a novel Gaussian Process-based non-parametric approach for calibrating wheeled robots with arbitrary or unknown drive configurations. The procedure is more general as it learns the entire sensor/robot motion model in terms of odometry measurements. Different from existing non-parametric approaches, our method relies on measurements from the onboard sensors and hence does not require the ground truth information from external motion capture systems. Alternatively, we propose a computationally efficient approach that relies on the linear approximation of the sensor motion model.

This paper presents our recent research on developing SAR by evaluating the ability of a life-like conversational social robot, called Ryan, to administer internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) to older adults with depression. For Ryan to administer the therapy, we developed a dialogue-management system, called Program-R. Using an accredited CBT manual for the treatment of depression, we created seven hour-long iCBT dialogues and integrated them into Program-R using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML). To assess the effectiveness of Robot-based iCBT and users' likability of our approach, we conducted an HRI study with a cohort of elderly people with mild-to-moderate depression over a period of four weeks.

However, MPC requires the model of the system in question. Since an accurate model of the liquid dynamics is difficult to obtain, the usefulness of MPC for the pouring task is uncertain. In this work, we model the dynamics of water using a recurrent neural network (RNN), which enables the use of MPC for pouring control.

1511,1511,An Efficient and Accurate Algorithm for the Perspecitve-n-Point Problem,"In this paper, we address the problem of pose estimation from N 2D/3D point correspondences, known as the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. Although many solutions have been proposed, it is hard to optimize both computational complexity and accuracy at the same time. In this paper, we propose an accurate and simultaneously efficient solution to the PnP problem. Previous PnP algorithms generally involve two sets of unknowns including the depth of each pixel and the pose of the camera. Our formulation does not involve the depth of each pixel. By introducing some intermediate variables, this formulation leads to a fourth degree polynomial cost function with 3 unknowns that only involves the rotation. In contrast to previous works, we do not address this minimization problem by solving the first-order optimality conditions using the off-the-shelf Gröbner basis method, as the Gröbner basis method may encounter numeric problems. Instead, we present a method based on linear system null space analysis to provide a robust initial estimation for a Newton iteration.

1512,1512,Robot Finger with Remote Center of Motion Mechanism for Covering Joints with Thick Skin,"An end-effector such as a gripper or multi-fingered hand is essential to enable robots to grasp and manipulate objects of various size and shape. Soft skin increases the grasp stability and can provide space for tactile sensors. However, covering the joints with skin is challenging, typically causing a considerable surface area of multi-segment robot fingers not to be covered by skin. This also creates the risk that objects get pinched in the joints when flexing the fingers. The current paper suggests using a remote center motion (RCM) mechanism to move the center of joint rotation to the surface of a thick skin layer. In particular, a 6-bar mechanism is used. Thereby, a thick soft skin layer with a continuous surface can be realized. Furthermore, adaptive joint coupling with linkages is implemented. In the current paper a 2-fingered gripper is realized, and objects of various size and shape are grasped (from thin paper to objects of 135 mm diameter). The current gripper was manufactured with 3D-printed material to enable rapid prototyping, therefore the payload was limited to only 1 kg for this version.

1514,1514,Design and Comparative Analysis of 1D Hopping Robots,"Hopping is a highly dynamic motion requiring precise input over brief moments of ground contact in order to achieve desired performance. While this problem has been approached from multiple perspectives, this work provides a comparative analysis of two robot models. The first model uses an actuator to store energy in a spring and release it during the ground phase, while the second uses an actuator to move an additional mass vertically to generate force on the spring. In the first model, analytic expressions are used to find the desired controllers, while trajectory optimization is used in the latter. Orbital stability of each model under the conditions of uncertain damping and poor estimation of the hop height is examined. To this end, Poincaré analysis is used to give a metric of stability in the presence of different initial conditions and parameter uncertainty. Simulations show that the first model converges quickly to a point near the desired height determined by the amount of uncertain damping present. The second model is less robust to uncertainty, but is be made to converge to a desired height with the addition of PD control around the optimal trajectory. This robustness is improved with different gains in the controller.

In this approach, a scheduling agent is associated with each intersection. Each agent senses the traffic approaching its intersection and in real-time constructs a schedule that minimizes the cumulative wait time of vehicles approaching the intersection over the current look-ahead horizon. In this paper, we propose a cooperative algorithm that utilizes both connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) and schedule-driven traffic control to create better traffic flow in the city. The algorithm enables an intersection scheduling agent to adjust the arrival time of an approaching platoon through use of wireless communication to control the velocity of vehicles. The sequence of approaching platoons is thus shifted toward a new shape that has smaller cumulative delay.

In reality, human observers tend to also act in an adversarial manner towards deployed robotic systems. We show that this can in fact improve the robustness of the learned models by proposing a physical framework that leverages perturbations applied by a human adversary, guiding the robot towards more robust models. In a manipulation task, we show that grasping success improves significantly when the robot trains with a human adversary as compared to training in a self-supervised manner.",60029311,University of Southern California,Los Angeles,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.4,0.1553030303030303,0.2773809523809524,1
1517,1517,Trajectory Optimization for Unknown Constrained Systems using Reinforcement Learning,"In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for trajectory optimization for constrained dynamical systems. This problem is motivated by the fact that for most robotic systems, the dynamics may not always be known. Generating smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories could be difficult for such systems. Using sampling-based algorithms for motion planning may result in trajectories that are prone to undesirable control jumps. However, they can usually provide a good reference trajectory which a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm can then exploit by limiting the search domain and quickly finding a dynamically smooth trajectory. We use this idea to train a reinforcement learning agent to learn a dynamically smooth trajectory in a curriculum learning setting.

1518,1518,Achievement of Online Agile Manipulation Task for Aerial Transformable Multilink Robot,"Transformable aerial robots are favorable in aerial manipulation tasks for their flexible ability to change configuration during the flight. By assuming robot keeping in the mild motion, the previous researches sacrifice aerial agility to simplify the complex non-linear system into a single rigid body with a linear controller. In this paper, we present a framework towards agile swing motion for the transformable multi-links aerial robot. We introduce a computational-efficient non-linear model predictive controller and joints motion primitive frame-work to achieve agile transforming motions and validate with a novel robot named HYRURS-X.

For overcoming the degradation of matching photometry under appearance changes, recent research resorted to introducing geometry constraints of the prior scene structure. In this paper, we present a metric localization method for the monocular camera, using the Signed Distance Field (SDF) as a global map representation. Leveraging the volumetric distance information from SDFs, we aim to relax the assumption of an accurate structure from the local Bundle Adjustment (BA) in previous methods. By tightly coupling the distance factor with temporal visual constraints, our system corrects the odometry drift and jointly optimizes global camera poses with the local structure. We validate the proposed approach on both indoor and outdoor public datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, it achieves a comparable performance with a minimal sensor configuration.",60008592,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.142857142857142,-0.0032312925170067974,0.20017006802721093,1
1520,1520,Position-based monocular visual servoing of an unknown target using online self-supervised learning,"Visual servoing, i.e. control with visual information, is a valuable capability in many robotic applications. In particular, position based visual servoing (PBVS) estimates position information from the observed image to generate visual servo control. However, the estimation of the position of an unknown target using monocular images is still difficult due to the complexity of the image information. For the target estimation problem, we propose to integrate three complementary techniques for monocular visual servoing. First, to estimate the probability of a target's existence, the learning model with spatial features from convolution neural network is proposed. Second, the extended Kalman filter based on epipolar geometry estimates the 3D position of the target; moreover, from this 3D position, the perception model is trained online by self-generated virtual ground-truth. Finally, visual servo control is generated, and the resulting movement helps to construct epipolar geometry. Finally. the experimental validation is performed in a challenging setting involving occlusion and target's shape change.",60013682,Seoul National University,Seoul,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",15.7,0.04068627450980392,0.3377450980392157,1
1521,1521,SemanticKITTI: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of LiDAR sequences,"Semantic scene understanding is important for various applications. In particular, self-driving cars need a fine-grained understanding of the surfaces and objects in their vicinity. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) provides precise geometric information about the environment and is thus a part of the sensor suites of almost all self-driving cars. Despite the relevance of semantic scene understanding for this application, there is a lack of a large dataset for this task which is based on an automotive LiDAR. In this paper, we introduce a large dataset to propel research on laser-based semantic segmentation. We annotated all sequences of the KITTI Vision Odometry Benchmark and provide dense point-wise annotations for the complete 360-degree field-of-view of the employed automotive LiDAR. We propose three benchmark tasks based on this dataset: (i) semantic segmentation of point clouds using a single scan, (ii) semantic segmentation using multiple past scans, and (iii) semantic scene completion, which requires to anticipate the semantic scene in the future. We provide baseline experiments and show that there is a need for more sophisticated models to efficiently tackle these tasks.

1522,1522,StarNet: Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Deep Neural Network in Star Topology,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for many important applications. This problem is a great challenge because of complicated interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods model only the pairwise interactions between pedestrians, which not only oversimplifies the interactions among pedestrians but also is computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel model StarNet to deal with these issues. StarNet has a star topology which includes a unique hub network and multiple host networks. The hub network takes observed trajectories of all pedestrians to produce a comprehensive description of the interpersonal interactions. Then the host networks, each of which corresponds to one pedestrian, consult the description and predict future trajectories. The star topology gives StarNet two advantages over conventional models. First, StarNet is able to consider the collective influence among all pedestrians in the hub network, making more accurate predictions. Second, StarNet is computationally efficient since the number of host network is linear to the number of pedestrians. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that StarNet outperforms multiple state-of-the-arts by a large margin in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.",120356693,Meituan-Dianping Group,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",16.18181818181818,0.14903628117913834,0.4993197278911565,1

The soft skin and the multi-joint skeletal structure make it possible to distribute the contact pressure, which is necessary for not only touching a living body such as a human or an agricultural crop, but also for touching an artificial object such as pastry or an industrial product without damaging it or its package.

1524,1524,Pose-Aware Placement of Objects with Semantic Labels - Brandname-based Affordance Prediction and Cooperative Dual-Arm Active Manipulation,"The Amazon Picking Challenge and the Amazon Robotics Challenge have shown significant progress in object picking from a cluttered scene, yet object placement remains challenging. It is useful to have pose-aware placement based on human and machine readable pieces on an object. For example, the brandname of an object placed on a shelf should be facing the human customers. The robotic vision challenges in the object placement task: A) the semantics and geometry of the object to be placed need to be analysed jointly; b) and the occlusions among objects in a cluttered scene could make it hard for proper understanding and manipulation. To overcome these challenges, we develop a pose-aware placement approach by spotting the semantic labels (e.g., brandnames) of objects in a cluttered tote and then carrying out a sequence of actions to place the objects on a shelf or on a conveyor with desired poses. Our major contributions include 1) providing an open benchmark dataset of objects and brandnames with multi-view segmentation for training and evaluations; 2) carrying out comprehensive evaluations for our brandname-based fully convolutional network (FCN) that can predict the affordance and grasp to achieve pose-aware placement, whose success rates decrease along with clutters; 3) showing that active manipulation with two cooperative manipulators and grippers can effectively handle the occlusion of brandnames. We analyzed the success rates and discussed the failure cases to provide insights for future applications.

In this study, a parallel gripper with a universal fingertip device that combines both object holding using jamming transition and optical sensing is proposed. By using a transparent material along with the jamming transition, both a tactile sense is achieved via optical sensing and the holding stability is improved by tightly restraining the object. Because the hardness of the contact region of the membrane can be adjusted, the gripper can grasp heavy objects as well as light objects. In this paper, the structure of the developed gripper and its grasping characteristics are described, and the experimental results from grasping and sensing are presented. It is experimentally shown that the proposed gripper is capable of both grasping fragile objects (such as an egg and tofu) by using tactile sensing and grasping dumbbells (with weights between 1-3 kg) by using jamming transition. Additionally, grasping a plastic cup, the proposed gripper demonstrated the potential of combining tactile sensing and more-constrained grasping.",60025017,Nara Institute of Science and Technology,Ikoma,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.285714285714285,0.030102040816326534,0.37755102040816324,1

This paper presents a multi-sensor multi-hypothesis method for robust 6-DoF localization in complex environments. Robustness and accuracy requirements are addressed as follows. First, camera and LIDAR features are seamlessly integrated in the same statistical framework, benefiting from their synergies and providing robustness in scenarios with low or varying densities of LIDAR and visual features. Second, a multi-hypothesis approach is adopted to cope with scenario symmetries. The method has been carefully designed to operate in real time using feature and hypothesis filtering and efficient hypothesis refinement, and has been coded in a multi-core implementation.

The motion measurements are often affected by synchronization issues and hardware malfunctions. When using pose sensors, such as Electromagnetic or Inertial Measurement Units, the measurements are often less reliable than those obtained by a traditional robot-link and camera pair. Corrupt measurements, whether due to disturbances, large synchronization mismatches or malfunctions, are considered outliers that ought to be filtered out of the estimation process. While this may be achieved non-deterministically by using Random Sample Consensus, we propose a deterministic, robust and accurate method for solving the Hand-Eye calibration problem despite the presence of large amounts of outliers and high levels of measurement noise. The proposed method is based on a reformulation of this estimation problem as a rank-constrained semi-definite programming problem allowing for robustness to be enforced via an iteratively re-weighted optimization approach.",60103368,Université de Strasbourg,Strasbourg,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",27.0,-0.05482683982683981,0.5201948051948052,1
1530,1530,Robots that Take Advantage of Human Trust,"Humans often assume that robots are rational. We believe robots take optimal actions given their objective; hence, when we are uncertain about what the robot's objective is, we interpret the robot's actions as optimal with respect to our estimate of its objective. This approach makes sense when robots straightforwardly optimize their objective, and enables humans to learn what the robot is trying to achieve. However, our insight is that-when robots are aware that humans learn by trusting that the robot actions are rational-intelligent robots do not act as the human expects; instead, they take advantage of the human's trust, and exploit this trust to more efficiently optimize their own objective. In this paper, we formally model instances of human-robot interaction (HRI) where the human does not know the robot's objective using a two-player game. We formulate different ways in which the robot can model the uncertain human, and compare solutions of this game when the robot has conservative, optimistic, rational, and trusting human models. In an offline linear-quadratic case study and a real-time user study, we show that trusting human models can naturally lead to communicative robot behavior, which influences end-users and increases their involvement.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",27.857142857142858,0.051250000000000004,0.25625,1

Our model relies on a novel formulation which assumes the pressure exerted on a suction cup during active control is based on constraint resolution. Our algorithmic implementation uses a classification process to handle the contacts during the suction phenomenon of the suction cup on a surface. Then, we formulate a convenient way for coupling the pressure constraint with the multiple contact constraints. We propose an evaluation of our approach through a comparison with real data, showing the ability of our model to reproduce the behavior of suction cups.

This study aims to propose two approaches for controlling the motion of a service robot as it pours liquid precisely from an unknown container into another unknown container without the need of any external tools. To realize this task, we must resolve two sub-tasks, which are determining the poured volume and controlling the pouring action. Our first proposal concentrates on the target container. The poured volume is calculated using a model of target container and the height of liquid in the target container. The action is controlled using a proportional-derivative controller, which considers the angular speed of the pouring container as a process variable and the poured volume as a control variable. Our second method concentrates on the pouring container. The poured volume is calculated using the relation between the angle of the pouring container and poured volume. The action is controlled with a simple proportional controller that takes the angular speed of the pouring container as a process variable and target angle as a control variable. A point cloud is used to model the two containers. These two methods were implemented in a dualarm robot system for testing, and the results show that both methods are effective for controlling precise pouring tasks.",60032315,University of Electro-Communications,Chofu,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.181818181818183,0.13214285714285715,0.37431972789115653,1

Crucially, we utilize a viewpoint-dependent classifier model over rich classifier outputs and leverage the coupling between poses and semantic measurements both for disambiguating data association and in pose estimation. We demonstrate in simulation that incorporating semantic measurements with a viewpoint-dependent classifier model enhances disambiguation of both data association and localization over usage of only geometric measurements or viewpoint independent models, further contributing to the tractability of the approach in practice, and providing better estimates.",60022403,Technion - Israel Institute of Technology,Haifa,Israel,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",30.5,0.125,0.5535714285714286,1

In this paper, we develop a new electromechanical actuator that volumetrically expands. By combining auxetic materials with a servo, we produce a simple isotropically expanding actuator that can be modularly composed. We discuss the symmetry considerations in selecting an appropriate auxetic framework for our actuator, eventually choosing a double-layered polyhedral auxetic design. Characterization shows that a single actuator can expand in radius to 119% of the original size and generate 90N of force, while maintaining a small package and a speedy expansion / contraction cycle.

The resulting articulated multi-perspective camera is analyzed in theory and practice, and we show that - by taking the non-holonomic constraints of the vehicle into account - a single point correspondence measured from the trailer is sufficient to render the additional unknown parameters given by the internal joint configuration before and after a relative displacement fully observable. optimizing over all parameters enhances the accuracy of the motion estimation of the entire system with respect to using the cameras on each rigid part alone.

1543,1543,Design of a Growing Robot Inspired by Plant Growth,"A novel design concept of expandable robotic arm inspired by plant growth is presented. The robot can construct its own structure by converting a type of fluidized material into a rigid structure at its growing point. The robot can extend its structure in multiple directions, and move through a winding space to reach a point, which is otherwise difficult to access. The robot with the rigid structure can also bear a significant load, has a plate to attach an end-effector, and can transport an object. The robot satisfies three key functional requirements that are characteristic to plant growth. First, the robot is capable of transporting structural materials to its growing point. Second, the robot is capable of transforming the material into a rigid structure. Third, it is capable of steering its growing point so that it is expanded in a desired direction.

1544,1544,Magnetic-Needle-Assisted Micromanipulation of Dynamically Self-Assembled Magnetic Droplets for Cargo Transportation,"Dynamic self-assembly is treated as a promising approach for generating a robotic swarm to perform coordinated tasks, and the assembled pattern can be tuned by regulating the energy input. However, location of a dynamically assembled pattern is hard to be determined, especially under global fields, such as magnetic field. In this paper, we report the formation and manipulation of dynamic self-assembled droplets at the air-liquid interface with the assistance of a magnetic needle. Affected by the locally induced field gradient near the needle, reconfigurable assembled droplets are obtained with higher time-efficiency, and the location of the pattern can be determined. The pattern is reversibly tuned to exhibit expansion and shrinkage by adjusting the height of the needle. Assembled droplets are able to be steered via following the needle in a controlled manner. Moreover, cargo is trapped by exploiting the induced rotational flow around the droplets, and it can also be caged into the central area of the pattern and transported to the desired location.

1546,1546,Sampling-based motion planning of 3D solid objects guided by multiple approximate solutions,"Sampling-based motion planners are often used to solve motion planning problems for robots with many degrees of freedom. These planners explore the related configuration space by random sampling. The well-known issue of the sampling-based planners is the narrow passage problem. Narrow passages are small collision-free regions in the configuration space that are, due to their volume, difficult to cover by the random samples. The volume of the narrow passages can be artificially increased by reducing the size of the robot, e.g., by scaling-down its geometry, which increases the probability of placing the random samples into the narrow passages. This allows us to find an approximate solution (trajectory) and use it as a guide to find the solution for a larger robot. Guiding along an approximate solution may, however, fail if this solution leads through such parts of the configuration space that are not reachable or traversable by a larger robot. To improve this guiding process, we propose to compute several approximate solutions leading through different parts of the configuration space, and use all of them to guide the search for a larger robot. We introduce the concept of disabled regions that are prohibited from the exploration using the sampling process. The disabled regions are defined using trajectories already found in the space being searched. The proposed method can solve planning problems with narrow passages with higher success rate than other state-of-the-art planners.",60013323,Ceské vysoké ucení technické v Praze,Prague,Czech Republic,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.09090909090909,-0.17758620689655177,0.46034482758620693,1

The proposed method is mainly composed of four sequential modules, namely scan pre-processing module, dynamic object detection module, laser-inertial odometry module and laser mapping module. Scan pre-processing module uses inertial measurements to compensate the motion distortion of each laser scan. Then, the dynamic object detection module is used to detect and remove dynamic objects from each laser scan by applying CNN segmentation network. After obtaining the undistorted point cloud without moving objects, the laser-inertial odometry module uses an Error State Kalman Filter to fuse the data of laser and IMU and output the coarse pose estimation at high frequency. Finally, the laser mapping module performs a fine processing step and the 'Frame-to-Model'' scan matching strategy is used to create a static global map. We compare the performance of our method with two state-of-the-art methods, LOAM and SuMa, using KITTI dataset and real highway scene dataset.

Accurate localization is essential for navigation, path planning, and science objectives. On Earth, localization can be achieved using a satellite navigation system; such a system is, however, unavailable for other planetary bodies. Current absolute and relative localization methods for rovers on planetary surfaces are laborious manual tasks or accumulate significant location errors over time resulting in incorrect location estimates, respectively. Recently, Earth-based approaches have explored localization by matching surface-perspective imagery to satellite imagery using computer vision and machine learning. Those focusing on natural environments have shown such image matching to be feasible for localization, though it remains challenging. The purpose of this project was to produce a working proof-of-concept model to match surface-perspective imagery to satellite images for planetary roving applications. This would improve absolute localization accuracy (relative to current methods) by utilizing machine learning algorithms to offer greater automation and faster calculations, and produce a benchmark dataset for future studies.

The global and local features of frames are extracted using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and SURF on the GPU, which guarantee extremely fast extraction speeds. The graph vocabulary construction is based on one type of proximity graph, named Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs, which is modified to adapt to this specific application. In addition, this process is coupled with a novel strategy for real-time geometrical verification, which only keeps binary hash codes and significantly saves on memory usage.

Conventional methods for locating fault on transmission lines based on travelling wave and impendence-based methods usually suffer from large error due to the complexity of fault modeling on different type of faults. In this paper, an intelligent system for detection of fault location on transmission line using a hybrid model that integrates artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy expert system called Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is proposed. First, a three phase transmission lines is modeled and various types of faults are generated using MATLAB/Simulink. Then, the faulted current signal is segmented from the faulted transmission. Next, feature extraction is performed to obtained information from the faulted current signal. In this study, the extracted features are mean, standard deviation, energy, peak-to-peak and amplitude value. Feature selection is then applied to select important features that correlate with the fault location. For single-phase-to-ground fault, peak-to-peak value and energy is used. Meanwhile, for the line-to-line and double-phase-to-ground faults, only peak-to-peak value is used. Finally, ANFIS network is trained to locate the fault occurrence. Simulation results against two regression models; Linear Regression and Gaussian Process Regression indicated that the ANFIS network is superior in locating the fault.

1564,1564,Orientation Field Estimation for Noisy Fingerprint Image Enhancement," Published by Elsevier B.V.There is a growing trend towards employing automatic fingerprint identification systems (AFIS) as a viable biometric tool for identity verification. However, this technology is often defeated when attempting to process low-quality fingerprints. A popular technique is to utilize Coherence-Enhancing Diffusion (CED) first to raise fingerprint quality to a level where any recognition takes place. One of the principal functions of CED is to extract orientations by referencing neighbouring gradients. Gradient computations are noise-prone and tend to deviate away from the actual underlying orientation field. This paper proposes a cluster-based computational approach for reliable orientation field estimation based on a directional filter bank framework. The orientations present in fingerprints cluster themselves in a contagious group in the directional bands, that can be exploited towards their reliable estimation. The estimated orientation field then becomes an input data for the CED engine as a pre-computed add-on module to provide much- needed enhancement in noisy fingerprints that subsequently attains in better recognition performance for a given Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS). The experimental procedures reported in this study suggest more accurate orientation results in favour of proposed method than existing techniques even when processing very noisy real-life test data.

Furthermore, for planetary rovers that are traversing diverse types of terrain, wheel odometry is often unreliable for use in localization, due to wheel slippage. For current Mars rovers, computer vision-based approaches are generally used whenever there is a high possibility of positioning error; however, these strategies require additional computational power, energy resources, adequate features in the environment, and significantly slow down the rover traverse speed. To this end, we propose a navigation approach that compensates for the high likelihood of odometry errors by providing a reliable navigation solution that leverages non-holonomic vehicle constraints as well as state-aware pseudo-measurements (e.g., zero velocity and zero angular rate) updates during periodic stops. By using this, computationally expensive visual-based corrections could be performed less often. Experimental tests that compare against GPS-based localization are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach.

1568,1568,Automated Detection of Dyslexia Symptom Based on Handwriting Image for Primary School Children," Published by Elsevier B.V.This paper presents an automated detection system to identify the present of dyslexia symptoms in primary school children based on their handwriting images. The proposed automated detection system is developed by using pattern recognition technique. Based on their handwriting images, the pattern recognition system will detect and extract the features of the written characters using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). By comparing the automated correct detection and manually calculation, the accuracy of the classification is obtained of 73.33%. An artificial neural network (ANN) is an information processing system that is inspired by the ability of biological neural systems to process information. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated based on the accuracy of the ANN which is also used to classify the levels of dyslexia risks namely as low risk (LR) and risk (R). The best numbers were selected by maximum value of the classification accuracy on the test value is 0.7083 which the value of hidden nodes use in ANN is 4. The performance of the classification accuracy is immediate. For future works, need more samples and add more features in image processing.

1569,1569,With Proximity Servoing towards Safe Human-Robot-Interaction,"In this paper, we present a serial kinematic robot manipulator equipped with multimodal proximity sensing modules not only on the TCP but distributed on the robot's surface. The combination of close distance proximity information from capacitive and time-of-flight (ToF) measurements allows the robot to perform safe reflex-like and collision-free motions in a changing environment, e.g. where humans and robots share the same workspace. Our methods rely on proximity data and combine different strategies to calculate orthogonal avoidance motions. These motions are instantaneous optimal and are fed directly into the motion controller (proximity servoing). The strategies are prioritized, firstly to avoid collision and then secondly to maintain the task motion if kinematic redundancy is available. The motion is then optimized for avoidance, best manipulability, and smallest end-effector velocity deviation.

1570,1570,ORBSLAM-Atlas: A robust and accurate multi-map system,"We propose ORBSLAM-Atlas, a system able to handle an unlimited number of disconnected sub-maps, that includes a robust map merging algorithm able to detect submaps with common regions and seamlessly fuse them. The outstanding robustness and accuracy of ORBSLAM are due to its ability to detect wide-baseline matches between keyframes, and to exploit them by means of non-linear optimization, however it only can handle a single map. ORBSLAM-Atlas brings the wide-baseline matching detection and exploitation to the multiple map arena. The result is a SLAM system significantly more general and robust, able to perform multisession mapping. If tracking is lost during exploration, instead of freezing the map, a new sub-map is launched, and it can be fused with the previous map when common parts are visited. Our criteria to declare the camera lost contrast with previous approaches that simply count the number of tracked points, we propose to discard also inaccurately estimated camera poses due to bad geometrical conditioning. As a result, the map is split into more accurate sub-maps, that are eventually merged in a more accurate global map, thanks to the multi-mapping capabilities.We provide extensive experimental validation in the EuRoC datasets, where ORBSLAM-Atlas obtains accurate monocular and stereo results in the difficult sequences where ORBSLAM failed. We also build global maps after multiple sessions in the same room, obtaining the best results to date, between 2 and 3 times more accurate than competing multi-map approaches. We also show the robustness and capability of our system to deal with dynamic scenes, quantitatively in the EuRoC datasets and qualitatively in a densely populated corridor where camera occlusions and tracking losses are frequent.",60016809,Universidad de Zaragoza,Zaragoza,Spain,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",30.22222222222222,0.11398951925267714,0.41537650945545684,1

Yet, previous technological solutions to apply tactile stimuli for body illusion induction limit participants movements, do not allow for stimulations in dynamic environments (e.g., the subject walking), and can hardly be integrated into real-life settings and complex, interactive, virtual reality environments. Here, we present the development and first validation of a new semi-wearable haptic system, based on vibration technology, to induce a range of bodily illusions that are of relevance for research in psychiatry.

1572,1572,Soft Polymer-Electrolyte-Fuel-Cell Tube Realizing Air-Hose-Free Thin McKibben Muscles,"Among the various pneumatic actuators, thin McKibben muscles are particularly attractive owing to their high performance in terms of high contraction ratio, high flexibility, and productivity. One of the challenges for thin McKibben muscles and other pneumatic actuators is the fact that they generally need air hoses and air sources like compressors. This necessarily leads to bulky systems. To solve this problem, we propose and study a new approach to driving pneumatic actuators that exploits electrolysis/synthesis of water by a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC). This method could in-principle have high applicability to thin McKibben muscles. However, one challenge must still be addressed for the realization of an electrically driven thin McKibben muscle: the development of a tube-shaped soft PEFC. This paper proposes an electrically driven thin McKibben muscle with a tube-shaped soft PEFC realized through a flowing non-electrolytic plating method. First, the proposed thin McKibben muscle is briefly described. Then, a novel method for plating a tube-shaped soft PEFC using reflux is introduced, and its fundamental operation is tested. After the evaluation of the PEFC, we report a prototype realization of the proposed thin McKibben muscle. The developed prototype has a length of over 170 mm, a diameter of 4 mm, and high flexibility for bending. Finally, we elaborate on a driving experiment through which fundamental characteristics were experimentally evaluated.

This paper proposes a planner to plan the dual-arm assembly of more than three objects. It automatically generates the grasp configurations and assembly poses, and simultaneously searches and backtracks the grasp space and assembly space to accelerate the motion planning of robot arms. Meanwhile, the proposed method considers gravitational constraints during robot motion planning to avoid breaking the finished part.

The spontaneous formation of stable helical waves along the length of the flagellum is responsible for the generation of positive net thrust.

1575,1575,Situation Awareness for Proactive Robots in HRI,"Perception of the intention of humans prior to an interaction is a demanding skill during human-robot interaction (HRI). This skill is even more sought after during robot-initiated HRI. Initiating an interaction in an inappropriate situation can be avoided when robots are equipped with the ability to decide when to interact and when not to. Many of the existing systems investigate only a few characteristics of humans which demonstrate inner state of mind and are based on complex monitoring mechanisms which limit their use in most of the scenarios. This work presents an autoregressive model based on observable physical and emotional human cues to determine the level of interest displayed by a human towards an interaction with a robot. This model was implemented on a service robotic platform and the behavior of the robot was controlled using the model. The behavior of the robot was determined by means of proxemic approach and the nature of conversation with the human. The outcomes of the model were evaluated by analyzing user feedback in different situations inside a simulated social environment. Using the model, robot was given the ability to analyze the situation of its human user in an emotionally intelligent manner, prior to an interaction.

1577,1577,GRIP: Generative Robust Inference and Perception for Semantic Robot Manipulation in Adversarial Environments,"Recent advancements have led to a proliferation of machine learning systems used to assist humans in a wide range of tasks. However, we are still far from accurate, reliable, and resource-efficient operations of these systems. For robot perception, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection and pose estimation are recently coming into widespread use. However, neural networks are known to suffer from overfitting during the training process and are less robust under unforeseen conditions (which makes them especially vulnerable to adversarial scenarios). In this work, we propose Generative Robust Inference and Perception (GRIP) as a two-stage object detection and pose estimation system that aims to combine the relative strengths of discriminative CNNs and generative inference methods to achieve robust estimation. Our results show that a second stage of sample-based generative inference is able to recover from false object detections by CNNs, and produce robust estimations in adversarial conditions. We demonstrate the efficacy of GRIP robustness through comparison with state-of-the-art learning-based pose estimators and pick-and-place manipulation in dark and cluttered environments.",60025778,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Ann Arbor,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.285714285714285,-0.06805555555555556,0.4354166666666666,1
1578,1578,Applying Intrusion Detection and Response systems for securing the Client Data Signals in the Egyptian Optical Network," Published by Elsevier B.V.The physical layer of the Optical Transport Network (OTN) is the weakest layer in the network, as anyone can access the optical cables from any unauthorized location of the network and stat his attack by using any type of the vulnerabilities. The paper discusses the future role of the machine learning technology in the detection of the security threats and the automatic response to overcome the security challenges in the Egyptian optical network and it presents a new proposed model for the threats detection and the response to protect the client's data on the physical layer of the optical network. The detections of the threats in the optical network will be done in our model by proposing learning algorithms from the continuous variations in the optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) over the entire network and at the same time according to the past experiences of the proposed model it will decide if this variations are threats or normal attenuations on the optical cables. The response will be done by distributing the triggers for the encryption keys between the network elements according to the decisions of the intrusion detection system of the machine learning techniques. A new security layer will be established to the OTN frames in the infected sections only. The design of the proposed security model is done by using a structure of XOR, a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), Random Number Generator (RNG) associated with different techniques of learning algorithms, and expert system for the threats in the optical network. We propose the security model for different rates in the OTN and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) system. The proposed model is implemented on the basis of protecting the infected sections in the physical layer only over the optical network by passing these signals into extra layer called security layer, and before forming the final frame of the OTN system, this done according to the decisions of our proposed security learning algorithms in the management layer of the optical network. The results show that using machine learning techniques in the proposed model of the OTN encryption scheme is providing a high security against any wiretapping attack and reduces the huge cost of implementing complete security algorithms over all the network sections without any benefits. Although the proposed model of the intrusion detection and response systems in the optical network will be implemented on the infected sections only the attacker who has the ability to access the fiber cables from any unauthorized location, will affect the OSNR value and as a consequences the system will detect this difference in the value of the OSNR and according to the past experience the system will response to this threat, the attacker will find encrypted data only and will take many years to find one right key to perform the decryption process.",60009750,Minia University,Minia,Egypt,['1700'],47.4,0.033401598401598405,0.5399375624375625,0

In order to achieve this, robots need to be able to track people within their vicinity. This work presents an approach to tracking people from a mobile robot platform, incorporating a novel approach to human motion prediction. Unfavorable viewing angles, motion blur and ever-changing light conditions are constant issues for sensors on mobile vehicles. Therefore, a system is needed which increases the tracking quality of humans in order to cope with a low detection rate. The scientific contribution of this paper lies in a precise human model for tracking which utilizes historical spatial data of pedestrians from previous detection and from simulation. The model is embedded into a particle-filter based tracking approach designed for the use on a moving platform and is able to incorporate a variety of person detectors.

1580,1580,Haptic Shared-Control Methods for Robotic Cutting under Nonholonomic Constraints,"Robot-assisted cutting is considered an important task in several fields, such as robotic surgery, nuclear decommissioning, waste management, and manufacturing. Despite the complex dexterity requirements of cutting tasks, very simple mechanically-linked master-slave manipulators still dominate many of the above fields (e.g., nuclear robotics). Moreover, even when more dexterous manipulators are available (e.g., in robot-assisted surgery), the employed systems show little or no autonomy, delegating all control to the experience of the human operator. To ameliorate this situation, we present two haptic shared-control approaches for robotic cutting. They are designed to assist the human operator by enforcing different nonholonomic-like constraints representative of the cutting kinematics. To validate our approach, we carried out a human-subject experiment in a real cutting scenario. We compared our shared-control techniques with each other and with a standard haptic teleoperation scheme. Results show the usefulness of assisted control schemes in complex applications such as cutting. However, they also show a discrepancy between objective and subjective metrics.",60030553,Universite de Rennes 1,Rennes,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",17.666666666666668,-0.12187499999999998,0.4442602040816327,1

This paper describes the Kontur-2 experiments, in which the feasibility of this scenario was tested with the International Space Station as an orbiter, a cosmonaut operating a force-feedback joystick as an input device for teleoperation, and Earth as the planet where the teleoperated robot is located. In particular, we focus on human teleoperation performance, which is known to deteriorate under conditions of spaceflight. We investigate whether the provision of force feedback at the joystick is as beneficial as under terrestrial conditions.

Hindered by its nonlinear objective and complex constraints, this problem is hard even for state-of the-art nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers. The proposed framework addresses the problem by bilevel optimization. Specifically, the original problem is divided into an inner layer, which computes a time-optimal velocity profile along a fixed geometric path, and an outer layer, which refines the geometric path by a Quasi-Newton method. The inner optimization is convex and efficiently solved by interior-point methods. A novel variable reordering method is introduced to accelerate the optimization of the velocity profile. The gradients of the outer layer can be derived from the Lagrange multipliers using sensitivity analysis of parametric optimization problems. The method is guaranteed to return a feasible solution at any time, and numerical experiments on a ground vehicle with friction circle dynamics model show that the proposed method performs more robustly than general NLP solvers.",60000745,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Urbana,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.375,0.06309523809523811,0.38511904761904764,1

On the other hand, when applying conventional control methods to realize dynamic tasks with the flexible body, there are two difficulties: Accurate modeling of the flexible body and the derivation of intermediate postures to achieve the tasks. Learning-based methods are considered to be more effective than accurate modeling, but they require explicit intermediate postures. To solve these two difficulties at the same time, we developed a real-time task control method with a deep recurrent neural network named Dynamic Task Execution Network (DTXNET), which acquires the relationship among the control command, robot state including image information, and task state. Once the network is trained, only the target event and its timing are needed to realize a given task.

We propose a novel deep model to learn actions from human demonstration video for robotic manipulation. It consists of two deep networks, grasp detection network (GNet) and video captioning network (CNet). GNet performs two functions: providing grasp solutions and extracting the local features for the object of interests in robotic manipulation.

1591,1591,Model Simplification for Dynamic Control of Series-Parallel Hybrid Robots - A Representative Study on the Effects of Neglected Dynamics Shivesh,"It is becoming increasingly popular to use parallel mechanisms as modular subsystem units in the design of various robots for their superior stiffness, payload-to-weight ratio and dynamic properties. This leads to series-parallel hybrid robotic systems which pose several challenges in their modeling and control e.g. resolution of loop closure constraints, large size of their spanning tree etc. These robots are typically position-controlled and when equipped with real time dynamic control, often a simplified inverse dynamic model of these systems is utilized. However, the trade-offs of this model simplification has not been studied previously. This paper presents a representative study of the neglected dynamics by introducing some error metrics which are useful in highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of such model simplification. The study is guided with the help of a series-parallel humanoid leg which has been recently developed at DFKI-RIC.",60075096,German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI),Kaiserslautern,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.0,0.12535014005602238,0.35560224089635856,1

The contributions of this paper are twofold: 1) We show how we can make use of a learned dynamics model in combination with a model-based controller to simplify the BO problem by focusing onto the most relevant regions of the optimization domain. 2) Based on (1) we present a method to find an embedding in parameter space that reduces the effective dimensionality of the optimization problem.

1593,1593,Design of a Ballistically-Launched Foldable Multirotor,"The operation of multirotors in crowded environments requires a highly reliable takeoff method, as failures during takeoff can damage more valuable assets nearby. The addition of a ballistic launch system imposes a deterministic path for the multirotor to prevent collisions with its environment, as well as increases the multirotor's range of operation and allows deployment from an unsteady platform. In addition, outfitting planetary rovers or entry vehicles with such deployable multirotors has the potential to greatly extend the data collection capabilities of a mission. A proof-of-concept multirotor aircraft has been developed, capable of transitioning from a ballistic launch configuration to a fully controllable flight configuration in midair after launch. The transition is accomplished via passive unfolding of the multirotor arms, triggered by a nichrome burn wire release mechanism. The design is 3D printable, launches from a three-inch diameter barrel, and has sufficient thrust to carry a significant payload. The system has been fabricated and field tested from a moving vehicle up to 50mph to successfully demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and experimentally validate the design's aerodynamic stability and deployment reliability.

The proposed architecture takes individual object instances as input and learns the task of object recognition for 3D shapes. To train the network, we present a dataset of 31k 2.5D synthetic point clouds rendered from ModelNet40. Through 2.5D representation, the network learns object recognition despite occlusion that enables improved performance on objects from real world, while 2D binary maps enable feature learning that is independent of number of points in the point cloud.

1597,1597,Dynamic Variant Rank HEFT Task Scheduling Algorithm Toward Exascle Computing," Published by Elsevier B.V.The accomplishment of Exascale systems in the next few years will pose the need for deep hierarchical parallelism and a high degree of heterogeneity, in addition to the expected component failures. Moreover, it will be constrained by energy limitation and power consumption. As a result, Exascale scheduling algorithms need to be robust in balancing the workload consistently, reliably and efficiently amongst the processors. It is also required to achieve the lowest overhead complexity, and, at the same time, decrease the communication costs as low as possible. In this paper, a task scheduler framework is introduced. The framework consists of three parts, the first of which is the resource monitor, the second the task scheduler and the third the dispatcher. The resource monitor explores the resources in the system dynamically, collects the computing resources metadata, and updates the metadata in a continuous manner. The task-scheduler schedules the tasks based on an improved version of the Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) heuristic, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) scheduling algorithm. The dispatcher receives tasks list from scheduler to allocate tasks on a resources based on HEFT insertion method and constrained. The HEFT algorithm is compatible efficiently for heterogeneous systems and it improves operations without increasing the time complexity. In this paper, our improvement for HEFT algorithm is introduced. The improved algorithm is based on two steps: a static step which uses various schemes to prioritize the nodes (tasks) and a dynamic one. The dynamic step has the ability to allocates tasks that are scheduled statically and is able to receive and allocate new tasks dynamically. The algorithm we named: Dynamic Variant Rank HEFT algorithm (DVR HEFT), is implemented. A Random job generator is implemented to conduct a comparison study to evaluate DVR-HEFT algorithm against some of the state-of-the-art algorithms, specifically HEFT, PEFT, and Lookahead. Our results indicate that DVR-HEFT is able to reduce the scheduler's makespan in HEFT algorithm without increasing the algorithm's time complicity.",60004582,King Abdulaziz University,Jeddah,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],20.375,0.031652892561983455,0.38422176308539946,0

Thus this letter presents a novel investigation into the effects of limb morphology of quadrupeds during rapid transient maneuvers such as acceleration and deceleration. Three leg configurations inspired by nature (O-, X-Type and All-Ankle) as well as All-Knee configurations are compared. Extensive large scale Monte Carlo simulations utilizing contact-implicit trajectory optimization methods were employed on 100 randomly generated robots of varying sizes to determine the optimal configuration for the task of rapid transient locomotion.

To address this problem, we propose an occlusion-robust RGBD sequence tracking framework based on Coherent Point Drift (CPD). To mitigate the effects of occlusion, our method 1) Uses a combination of locally linear embedding and constrained optimization to regularize the output of CPD, thus enforcing topological consistency when occlusions create disconnected pieces of the object; 2) Reasons about the free-space visible by an RGBD sensor to better estimate the prior on point location and to detect tracking failures during occlusion; and 3) Uses shape descriptors to find the most relevant previous state of the object to use for tracking after a severe occlusion. Our method does not rely on physics simulation or a physical model of the object, which can be difficult to obtain in unstructured environments. Despite having no physical model, our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves improved accuracy in the presence of occlusion as compared to a physics-based CPD method while maintaining adequate run-time.",60025778,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Ann Arbor,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",35.8,0.15777777777777777,0.48126984126984135,1

However, most of these approaches fall short of being used on a real robot due to the extensive simulated training they require. These simulations lack the visuals and dynamics of the real world, which makes it infeasible to deploy on a real robot. We present a novel Neural Net based policy, NavNet, which allows for easy deployment on a real robot. It consists of two sub policies - a high level policy which can understand real images and perform long range planning expressed in high level commands; a low level policy that can translate the long range plan into low level commands on a specific platform in a safe and robust manner. For every new deployment, the high level policy is trained on an easily obtainable scan of the environment modeling its visuals and layout. We detail the design of such an environment and how one can use it for training a final navigation policy. Further, we demonstrate a learned low-level policy. We deploy the model in a large office building and test it extensively, achieving 0.80 success rate over long navigation runs and outperforming SLAM-based models in the same settings.",60006191,Google LLC,Mountain View,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.555555555555557,0.12257237554112554,0.3925453192640693,1

We show that a mild relaxation of the task and workspace constraints implicit in existing object grasping datasets can cause neural network based grasping algorithms to fail on even a simple block stacking task when executed under more realistic circumstances. To address this, we introduce the JHU CoSTAR Block Stacking Dataset (BSD), where a robot interacts with 5.1 cm colored blocks to complete an order-fulfillment style block stacking task. It contains dynamic scenes and real time-series data in a less constrained environment than comparable datasets. There are nearly 12,000 stacking attempts and over 2 million frames of real data. We discuss the ways in which this dataset provides a valuable resource for a broad range of other topics of investigation. We find that hand-designed neural networks that work on prior datasets do not generalize to this task. Thus, to establish a baseline for this dataset, we demonstrate an automated search of neural network based models using a novel multiple-input HyperTree MetaModel, and find a final model which makes reasonable 3D pose predictions for grasping and stacking on our dataset.

However, the numerous factors behind interaction work in conjunction, and the insights gained from one perspective can inadvertently affect another, creating a need for unification of these taxonomies and frameworks within an overarching taxonomy that systematically defines these relationships. In this paper we review existing taxonomies related to human-robot interaction, the behavioral sciences, and social and algorithmic taxonomies, and propose an overarching ontology for the factors from these works. We identify three main components characterizing the structure of an interaction (environment, task, and team), and structure them over two levels: contextual factors and factors driven by local dynamics.

Contributions are mainly made in the learning-based visual servoing component of the sequence, where a deep neural network is trained with various sets of synthetic data generated using the concept of domain randomization to predict where a hole is. In the experiments and analysis section, the network is analyzed and compared, and a real-world robotic system to insert pegs to holes using the proposed method is implemented.

Using GPS-camera-lidar sensor fusion, we detect actual lane boundaries (ALBs) and propose availability-reasonability-feasibility (ARF) threefold tests to determine if we should generate virtual lane boundaries (VLBs) or follow ALBs. If needed, VLBs are generated using a dynamically adjustable multi-objective optimization framework that considers obstacle avoidance, trajectory smoothness (to satisfy vehicle kinodynamic constraints), trajectory continuity (to avoid sudden movements), GPS following quality (to execute global plan), and lane following or partial direction following (to meeting human expectation).

Recent research in robot audition has analyzed noise reduction, section detection, and sound source separation for use in a real-world environment with many noises and overlaps. However, conventional methods apply respective functions in cascades. The biggest problem of cascade systems is the accumulation of errors generated at each function block. Although many methods of human voice separation have been proposed, robots operating in a real-world environment must be able to separate not only human voices but other environmental sounds. Unlike traditional sound source separation using spatial information, environmental sound segmentation must simultaneously detect sections and separate sound sources based on pre-trained features. One such method, U-Net, which was proposed for semantic segmentation of images, has been applied to the separation of singing voices. However, this method deals only with limited classes of sounds. The current study proposes an environmental sound segmentation method using Mask U-Net, which combines segmentation using U-Net with sound event detection using CNN to 75-classes of environmental sounds. Experimental application confirmed that this method improved learning speed and sound source separation compared with the conventional method.",60031126,Tokyo Institute of Technology,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.0,0.18145604395604395,0.4483516483516485,1

State-of-the-art methods improve the accuracy of both instance recognition and pose estimation using multitask learning. These methods use unified balancing parameters to integrate the loss of each task, which means task difficulties are the same for all objects. However, the method we propose can adjust the balancing parameters for each object. This idea is based on the assumption that task difficulties are different for each object, since the distinctiveness of object instances and poses depends on their appearance and shape. Our method sequentially estimates task difficulties for CNN based on the amount of loss change and calculates balancing parameters for each object. Our experiments show that our method improves the accuracy of both object instance recognition and pose estimation compared with state-of-the-art methods using the common LineMOD dataset.",60025555,Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.285714285714285,0.02500000000000001,0.55625,1

Our audio-based neural network uses the sound from a pouring sequence-A liquid being poured into a target container. Audio inputs consist of converting raw audio into mel-scaled spectrograms. Our audio-augmented network fuses this audio with its corresponding visual data based on video images. Only a microphone and camera are required, which can be found in any modern smartphone or Microsoft Kinect. Our approach improves classification accuracy for different environments, containers, and contents of the robot pouring task.

Vehicles, could be unmanned aerial vehicles (e.g. drones), share their sensors' information to improve network performance and provide safety, traffic efficiency, and entertainments. The accuracy and reliability of this information are vital for VANET performance. However, misbehaving (or faulty) vehicles, which exploit the cooperativeness feature by sharing bogus information, can disrupt the fundamental operations of any potential application and cause loss of people lives and properties. Unfortunately, existing detection approaches cannot effectively thwart such attacks. The highly dynamic vehicular context has been vastly neglected as well as they rely on predefined and static security perimeters to differentiate between false and correct information. In this paper, a context-aware detection approach is proposed to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false alarm rate. Firstly, the features that well represent the vehicular context has been extracted. Then, an online unsupervised learning method namely the hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to classify the received messages into either genuine or spurious. Finally, Bayesian-based hypothesis testing has been used to confirm the validity of the classification. Results show that the proposed detection approach is promising in effectively detect bogus information attack and improve applications performance.",60109729,Sana'a Community College,Sana'a,Yemen,['1700'],18.083333333333332,0.13437499999999997,0.6875,0
1621,1621,Free-Space Features: Global Localization in 2D Laser SLAM Using Distance Function Maps,"In many applications, maintaining a consistent map of the environment is key to enabling robotic platforms to perform higher-level decision making. Detection of already visited locations is one of the primary ways in which map consistency is maintained, especially in situations where external positioning systems are unavailable or unreliable. Mapping in 2D is an important field in robotics, largely due to the fact that man-made environments such as warehouses and homes, where robots are expected to play an increasing role, can often be approximated as planar. Place recognition in this context remains challenging: 2D lidar scans contain scant information with which to characterize, and therefore recognize, a location. This paper introduces a novel approach aimed at addressing this problem. At its core, the system relies on the use of the distance function for representation of geometry. This representation allows extraction of features which describe the geometry of both surfaces and free-space in the environment. We propose a feature for this purpose. Through evaluations on public datasets, we demonstrate the utility of free-space in the description of places, and show an increase in localization performance over a state-of-the-art descriptor extracted from surface geometry.",60025858,ETH Zürich,"Zurich ZH,",Switzerland,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.333333333333332,0.1326923076923077,0.5301282051282052,1

On the basis of the regularity of the pixel movement after camera pose changes, we formulate and prove the sinusoidal relationship between pixels movement and camera motion. We use the improved Fourier-Mellin invariant (iFMI) algorithm to find the motion of pixels, which was shown to be more accurate and robust than the feature-based methods. While iFMI works only on pin-hole model images and estimates 4 parameters (x, y, yaw, scaling), our method works on panoramic images and estimates the full 6 DoF3D transform, up to an unknown scale factor. For that we fit the motion of the pixels in the panoramic images, as determined by iFMI, to two sinusoidal functions. The offsets, amplitudes and phase-shifts of the two functions then represent the 3D rotation and translation of the camera between the two images. We perform experiments for 3D rotation, which show that our algorithm outperforms the feature-based methods in accuracy and robustness.

They rely on acquiring and using task knowledge, i.e., activity schemata, for generating solutions to problem instances in a class of tasks. Using Three-Valued Logic Analysis (TVLA), we extend our previous work to generate a set of conditions that determine the scope of applicability of an activity schema. The inferred scope is an abstract representation of a potentially unbounded set of problems, in the form of a 3-valued logical structure, which is used to test the applicability of the respective activity schema for solving different task problems.

Although several successful techniques for indoor localization have been proposed, the majority of them relies on maps generated from data gathered with the same sensor modality used for localization. Typically, tedious labor by experts is needed to acquire this data, thus limiting the readiness of the system as well as its ease of installation for inexperienced operators. In this paper, we propose a memory and computationally efficient monocular camera-based localization system that allows a robot to estimate its pose given an architectural floor plan. Our method employs a convolutional neural network to predict room layout edges from a single camera image and estimates the robot pose using a particle filter that matches the extracted edges to the given floor plan. We evaluate our localization system using multiple real-world experiments and demonstrate that it has the robustness and accuracy required for reliable indoor navigation.",60025641,Universität Freiburg im Breisgau,Freiburg im Breisgau,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.0,0.009821428571428571,0.48616071428571433,1

In this work, we present a cube-shaped robot that can roll through unstructured terrain and construct a detailed topographic map of the surface that it traverses in real time with low computational and monetary expense. Our approach devolves many of the complexities of locomotion and mapping to passive mechanical features. Namely, rolling movement is achieved by sequentially inflating latex bladders that are located on four sides of the robot to destabilize and tip it. Sensing is achieved via arrays of fine plastic pins that passively conform to the geometry of underlying terrain, retracting into the cube. We developed a topography by shade algorithm to process images of the displaced pins to reconstruct terrain contours and elevation. We experimentally validated the efficacy of the proposed robot through object mapping and terrain locomotion tasks.",60005455,Yale University,New Haven,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.857142857142858,0.10151515151515154,0.39545454545454545,1

When deploying the trained visual-based driving policy, a deterministic command is usually directly applied without considering the uncertainty of the input data. Such kind of policies may bring dramatical damage when applied in the real world. In this paper, we follow the recent real-to-sim pipeline by translating the testing world image back to the training domain when using the trained policy. In the translating process, a stochastic generator is used to generate various images stylized under the training domain randomly or directionally. Based on those translated images, the trained uncertainty-aware imitation learning policy would output both the predicted action and the data uncertainty motivated by the aleatoric loss function. Through the uncertainty-aware imitation learning policy, we can easily choose the safest one with the lowest uncertainty among the generated images.

However, the integration of deep learning introduces heavy computational requirements, preventing the deployment of such algorithms in scenarios that impose low-latency constraints during inference, in order to make mission-critical decisions in real-time. In this paper, we address the challenge of efficient deployment of region-based object detectors in aerial imagery, by introducing an informed methodology for extracting candidate detection regions (proposals). Our approach considers information from the UAV on-board sensors, such as flying altitude and light-weight computer vision filters, along with prior domain knowledge to intelligently decrease the number of region proposals by eliminating false-positives at an early stage of the computation, reducing significantly the computational workload while sustaining the detection accuracy. We apply and evaluate the proposed approach on the task of vehicle detection. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detection models can achieve up to 2.6x faster inference by employing our altitude-aware data-driven methodology.

1629,1629,PanopticFusion: Online Volumetric Semantic Mapping at the Level of Stuff and Things,"We propose PanopticFusion, a novel online volumetric semantic mapping system at the level of stuff and things. In contrast to previous semantic mapping systems, PanopticFusion is able to densely predict class labels of a background region (stuff) and individually segment arbitrary foreground objects (things). In addition, our system has the capability to reconstruct a large-scale scene and extract a labeled mesh thanks to its use of a spatially hashed volumetric map representation. Our system first predicts pixel-wise panoptic labels (class labels for stuff regions and instance IDs for thing regions) for incoming RGB frames by fusing 2D semantic and instance segmentation outputs. The predicted panoptic labels are integrated into the volumetric map together with depth measurements while keeping the consistency of the instance IDs, which could vary frame to frame, by referring to the 3D map at that moment. In addition, we construct a fully connected conditional random field (CRF) model with respect to panoptic labels for map regularization. For online CRF inference, we propose a novel unary potential approximation and a map division strategy. We evaluated the performance of our system on the ScanNet (v2) dataset. PanopticFusion outperformed or compared with state-of-the-art offline 3D DNN methods in both semantic and instance segmentation benchmarks.

A key advantage of the proposed approach is that an estimate of the value of the control Lyapunov function is available in real-time that can be used to monitor the system performance and provide a level of assurance concerning progress towards the goal.

In this paper, we derive a set of recursive equations for state probability and expected travel cost conditional on safety, and use them to implement a new stochastic variant of FMT-{ast } in the context of two types of objective functions that allow a glider to reach a destination region with minimum cost or maximum probability of arrival given a safety threshold.

We instead propose to use a machine-learning-based approach that learns to exploit the subtle elevation cues and prior knowledge of the scene from the data. We design an encoder-decoder structured deep convolutional neural network that takes a radar return intensity image in the range-azimuth plane as input and produces a depth image in the elevation-azimuth plane as output. We train the network with over 200 000 radar frames collected in highway environments.

We take the advantage of the high accuracy of LiDAR to resolve the lack of information in some regions of stereo images due to textureless objects, shadows, ill-conditioned light environment and many more. Additionally, this fusion can overcome the difficulty of matching unstructured 3D points between LiDAR-only scans. Our LiDAR-Flow approach consists of three main steps; each of them exploits LiDAR measurements. First, we build strong seeds from LiDAR to enhance the robustness of matches between stereo images. The imagery part seeks the motion matches and increases the density of scene flow estimation. Then, a consistency check employs LiDAR seeds to remove the possible mismatches. Finally, LiDAR measurements constraint the edge-preserving interpolation method to fill the remaining gaps.

The real world could bring all kinds of unexpected changes to the planned motion, the most deadly ones are usually marked by or caused by unexpected changes of contacts (object slipping away between fingers; getting stuck somewhere, etc). We notice that some actions are more likely to maintain desired contacts than others. To help finding these actions, in this work we propose a set of criteria to quantify the robustness of contacts against modeling uncertainties and disturbance forces. Under the quasi-static assumption, we analyze the causes of contact mode (sticking, sliding, disengaged) transitions and discuss how to endure larger uncertainties and disturbances. We summarize our results into several physically meaningful and easy-to-compute scores, which can be used to evaluate the quality of each individual contacts in a manipulation system.

A major challenge to address is a robust and accurate acquisition of localization estimates, as it is a prerequisite to enable more complex tasks, e.g. floating manipulation and mapping. State-of-the-art navigation in commercial operations, such as oil& gas production (OGP), rely on costly instrumentation. These can be partially replaced or assisted by visual navigation methods, especially in deep-sea scenarios where equipment deployment has high costs and risks. Our work presents a multimodal approach that adapts state-of-the-art methods from on-land robotics, i.e., dense point cloud generation in combination with plane representation and registration, to boost underwater localization performance. A (a) two-stage navigation scheme is proposed that initially generates a coarse probabilistic map of the workspace, which is used to filter noise from computed point clouds and planes in the second stage. Furthermore, an adaptive decision-making approach is introduced that determines which perception cues to incorporate into the localization filter to optimize accuracy and computation performance.

1637,1637,Unified Balance Control for Biped Robots Including Modification of Footsteps with Angular Momentum and Falling Detection Based on Capturability,"In this paper, we propose walking balance control based on Caputurability. The proposed method consists of five strategies: (i) moving Zero Moment Point (ZMP) in the support polygon (ii) landing position modification (iii) landing timing modification (iv) angular momentum control (v) falling detection and fall control. Walking pattern generation calculates the ZMP so that the Capture Point (CP) reaches the position of the supporting foot at the end of the double support phase. Owing to the asymmetry of the reachable landing region, landing timing modification is different in the sagittal and lateral planes, and the step time is extended in the lateral plane depending on the direction of disturbances. The torque around the center of gravity to avoid falling is realized through whole-body inverse kinematics with constraints on the angular momentum. In addition, we propose falling detection considering the reachable landing region. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments in which the biped robot was disturbed by pushing during tether-free walking.

People with severe depression symptoms are affected in their work, home, and social lives. Early diagnosis of mental illness is difficult, especially within the Arabic culture, because of the stigma of mental illness and lack of awareness in the field of psychiatry. Meanwhile, social media and its posts provide a new fertile source for mental health surveillance by people express their feelings, moods, and daily activity. Recently, the research field in detecting mental illness through social media has begun to be an exciting topic with the increase in popularity of social media platforms and the current studies in this area just covering English data. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has used Arabic data to explore depressive emotions in an online population. Our experiment, which is based on data collected from Twitter in the Gulf region, detects users who self-declared in their tweets as having been diagnosed with depression. Another set of tweets from non-depressed users was used as a standard group to construct a corpus with truth labels (depressed and non-depressed).

1642,1642,Learning from Demonstration Based on a Mechanism to Utilize an Object's Invisibility,"This paper proposes a novel visual Learning from Demonstration (LfD) system that teaches robots to learn tasks in which an object is put into another object, stacked, or transported by a tool. In such tasks, observation targets become invisible owing to occlusion or frame-out. The proposed 'Visual Hierarchy-based Function Estimator (Hi-Fes)' is inspired by the knowledge derived from the field of psychology that uses the visual hierarchy relationships to estimate the changes in observation targets. Hi-Fes employs a mechanism to interpolate the features when the targets are unrecognizable and state variables are incalculable directly. This method facilitated visual learning of complex state changes between multiple targets, in which the target becomes invisible or has a long period of invisibility, difficult for conventional learning methods. The proposed method was implemented in a life-sized humanoid robot and was evaluated in learning based on demonstration experiments. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.",60031955,Shinshu University,Matsumoto,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.571428571428573,-0.0744047619047619,0.3130952380952381,1

Direct CT guidance allows physicians to localize tumours quickly; however, needle insertion is still performed by hand. This system is mounted to a fully active motion stage superior to the patient's head and teleoperated by a radiologist. Unlike other similar robots, this robot's fully serial-link approach uses a unique combination of belt and cable drives for high-transparency and minimal-backlash, allowing for an expansive working area and numerous approach angles to targets, all while maintaining a small in-bore cross-section of less than 16cm2. Simulations verified the system's expansive collision free work-space and ability to hit targets across the entire chest, as required for lung cancer biopsy. Targeting error was on average < 1mm on a teleoperated accuracy task, illustrating the system's sufficient accuracy to perform biopsy procedures. While this system was developed for lung biopsies, it can be easily modified for other CT-guided needle based procedures.

In educational and hobbyist contexts, a large number of robots is required. By means of classical navigation approaches, every robot should be provided with accurate vision or range sensors. This limits the maximum number of robots in the fleet, due to the unaffordable cost of these sensors. In contrast to that, our system requires a single platform equipped with a higher quality sensor, used to perform calibration and mapping tasks. The rest of the fleet, able to localize and navigate, is equipped solely with low-cost sonars, providing a notable reduction in the overall cost. We achieve this task by presenting a novel calibration procedure to estimate the sonars extrinsic and adapting a classical monte-carlo localization algorithm to the sonar model, focusing on efficiency.

The method mainly consists of two parts, one is a motion model, based on data driving, learning to establish the correspondence between control signal sequence and vehicle motion, estimating the motion state of the next moment from historical data, eliminating complex CFFR modeling. The other is the tracking network. Based on the simulation data of the motion model, the relationship between the target trajectory and the current control command is learned, which simplifies the design and cumbersome tuning of the complex controller.

Most of the existing approaches either leverage visual or haptic information. However, these techniques may suffer from poor generalization performances on opaque containers or concerning measuring precision. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose to make use of audio vibration sensing and design a deep neural network PouringNet to predict the liquid height from the audio fragment during the robotic pouring task. PouringNet is trained on our collected real-world pouring dataset with multimodal sensing data, which contains more than 3000 recordings of audio, force feedback, video and trajectory data of the human hand that performs the pouring task. Each record represents a complete pouring procedure. We conduct several evaluations on PouringNet with our dataset and robotic hardware. The results demonstrate that our PouringNet generalizes well across different liquid containers, positions of the audio receiver, initial liquid heights and types of liquid, and facilitates a more robust and accurate audio-based perception for robotic pouring.",60028229,Universität Hamburg,Hamburg,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.625,0.09999999999999999,0.35490196078431374,1

Our unsupervised learning framework jointly reasons about the camera motion, optical flow, and 3D motion of moving objects. Three cooperating networks predict stereo matching, camera motion, and residual flow, which represents the flow component due to object motion and not from camera motion. Based on rigid projective geometry, the estimated stereo depth is used to guide the camera motion estimation, and the depth and camera motion are used to guide the residual flow estimation. We also explicitly estimate the 3D scene flow of dynamic objects based on the residual flow and scene depth. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms on the optical flow and visual odometry tasks.",60098464,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.166666666666668,-0.041666666666666664,0.18055555555555555,1
1648,1648,Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning Policies to Formal Methods for Moving Obstacle Avoidance,"Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a solution for moving obstacle avoidance. Deep RL learns to simultaneously predict obstacle motions and corresponding avoidance actions directly from robot sensors, even for obstacles with different dynamics models. However, deep RL methods typically cannot guarantee policy convergences, i.e., cannot provide probabilistic collision avoidance guarantees. In contrast, stochastic reachability (SR), a computationally expensive formal method that employs a known obstacle dynamics model, identifies the optimal avoidance policy and provides strict convergence guarantees. The availability of the optimal solution for versions of the moving obstacle problem provides a baseline to compare trained deep RL policies. In this paper, we compare the expected cumulative reward and actions of these policies to SR, and find the following. 1) The state-value function approximates the optimal collision probability well, thus explaining the high empirical performance. 2) RL policies deviate from the optimal significantly thus negatively impacting collision avoidance in some cases. 3) Evidence suggests that the deviation is caused, at least partially, by the actor net failing to approximate the action corresponding to the highest state-action value.",60033021,The University of New Mexico,Albuquerque,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.0,-0.0515079365079365,0.37452380952380954,1
1649,1649,Sequential clustering for tactile image compression to enable direct adaptive feedback,"The sense of touch is often crucial for humans to perform manipulation tasks. Providing tactile feedback during teleoperation or for users of prosthetic devices would be beneficial. However, the representation of tactile information constitutes a major technical challenge, since the numerous and possibly multimodal sensor readings are massive compared to the available tactile display technology. We introduce an algorithm that deploys two stages of K-means clustering along and across tactile image frames that render tactile sensor information at each time instant. In this manner, the massive tactile information is adaptively compressed in real-time while preserving its physical meaning, thus, remains intuitive and direct. We experimentally verify and examine the characteristics of our algorithm by evaluating the original and compressed tactile data. The data was gathered during the active tactile exploration of several objects of daily living by an Allegro robot hand that was covered with 15 uSkin sensor modules providing 2403-axis force vector measurements at each time instant. Our novel algorithm is straight forward enough to be implemented into tactile feedback systems. Finally, our algorithm allows for the direct feedback of massive tactile sensor data for a broad variety of tactile sensors and tactile displays, thereby, enables the compressed yet intuitive representation of massive tactile sensor information for real-time applications.",60023462,Waseda University,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.333333333333332,0.052777777777777785,0.5724454365079366,1

To face these complex systems, a hierarchical and multi-scale representation is crucial. This has brought the interest on Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement learning systems. Despite their successful application, Deep Reinforcement Learning systems suffer from a variety of drawbacks: they are data hungry, they lack of interpretability, and it is difficult to derive theoretical properties about their behavior. Classical Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning approaches, while not suffering from these drawbacks, are often suited for finite actions, and finite states, only. Furthermore, in most of the works, there is no systematic way to represent domain knowledge, which is often only embedded in the reward function.We present a novel Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework based on the hierarchical design approach typical of control theory.

The MCTS planner continuously builds a tree of the search space until either the allowed time per move is reached or the budget constraint for the search mission is met. In order to improve the performance of the MCTS planner, we propose a novel heuristic action selection policy to determine the value of a leaf node. The proposed heuristic is tailored to problems where making a turn incurs a higher cost than moving straight, such as the case on autonomous underwater vehicles. Through extensive simulations, we show that our heuristic yields a significant performance improvement over a lawnmover path planner - a commonly employed approach in subsea search applications - and over a simple MCTS planner where actions are selected uniformly at random.

1653,1653,A Density Map Estimation Model with DropBlock Regularization for Clustered-Fruit Counting,"Modern agricultural robots like drones have been studied in automatic yield estimation in recent years. Fruit counting is a fundamental task in the automatic yield estimation, on which significant progress has been achieved by detection-based methods and segmentation-regression-based methods. However, for clustered-fruit counting, the existing methods lack advantages on the localization of small and occluded fruits or discrete number regression. In addition, it is observed that existing deep neural network based counting methods have high variances on fruit density map estimation. Aiming at solving these two problems and decreasing the regression variance, in this paper, we propose a density-map-estimation model with DropBlock regularization. For evaluating the proposed model, we propose a new Clustered-Fruit dataset. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art counting methods on the Clustered-Fruit dataset.

It is difficult to design adaptive algorithms manually; however, by using end-to-end machine learning, labor can be saved during the design process. In our previous research, a task requiring force adjustment was achieved through imitation learning that considered position and force information using a four-channel bilateral control. Unfortunately, tasks that include long-term (slow) motion are still challenging. Furthermore, during system identification, there is a method known as the multi-decimation (MD) identification method. It separates lower and higher frequencies, and then identifies the parameters characterized at each frequency. Therefore, we proposed utilizing machine learning to take advantage of the MD method to infer short-term and long-term (high and low frequency, respectively) motion. In this paper, long-term motion tasks such as writing a letter using a pen fixed on a robot are discussed. We found differences in suitable sampling periods between position and force information.

These systems do not have full control of the car; however, there are more and more systems in development that take over individual driving functions completely. We are working towards a fully autonomous future. The goal is not only to transport people to their desired destination, but to make commuting on roads safer. Navigation is one of the essential tasks of autonomous driving. The software must independently calculate a route from its current location to the destination. If the vehicle is not guided precisely through the road network, it can never reach that destination. To cope with the problem, the data of the road network must be available to the vehicle. Based on this data, the vehicle must be able to calculate a route to its destination. This paper deals with the development of a navigation algorithm, for optimal path planning, within the framework of an industrial project.

Accordingly, we acquired our own datasets and tested RONet using realistic conditions. It is shown that the RONet can estimate the position of the mobile robot in real time using the Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier based only on range measurements. We also analyzed the sequence length of LSTM as a type of hyperparameters. We found that optimal sequence length is eight for more than eight anchors and twelve for fewer anchors compared to sequences with different lengths, given that construction of the network with the optimal sequence length estimates the position precisely and accounts for uncertainties. As verified experimentally, RONet yields more precise performance and results in increased robustness against outliers compared to a conventional range-only approach based on a particle filtering and the other conventional deep-learning-based approaches. We set three cases, reduced the number of anchors, and verified that the RONet was a robust solution. We also confirmed that it is the best solution that yields the smallest Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) values, equal to 4.466 cm, 3.210 cm, and 3.090 cm, in the cases where three, five, and eight anchors were deployed, respectively.",60032144,Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology,Yusong,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.875,0.21144179894179893,0.5207010582010582,1

Even more so if high rate propagation sensors (e.g. IMU) are used. This work presents an approach to implement such frameworks with significant complexity reduction compared to standard implementations. We set particular focus on the state covariance propagation as this chain of re-computations (i.e. F P F{T}+Q per propagation step) upon a delayed update is the dominant bottleneck. We draw our inspiration from the scattering theory and propose a method which projects the idea of wave propagation to an efficient concatenation of covariance propagation steps between filter updates. Through this approach, we reach a speed-up of more than a factor of 10 for the covariance propagation and render the computational complexity independent of the number of propagation steps between filter updates.

To this end, TopoNets leverage complex spatial relations expressed in terms of arbitrary, dynamic graphs. We demonstrate how TopoNets can be used to perform end-to-end semantic mapping from partial sensory observations and noisy topological relations discovered by a robot exploring large-scale office spaces. Thanks to their probabilistic nature and generative properties, TopoNets extend the problem of semantic mapping beyond classification.

This ability to detect a casualty is one of the most important features of mobile rescue robots, in order for them to be able to operate autonomously. We propose a deep-learning-based casualty detection method using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). This network is trained to be able to detect a casualty using a point-cloud data input. In the method we propose, the point cloud input is pre-processed to generate a depth image-like ground-projected heightmap. This heightmap is generated based on the projected distance of each point onto the detected ground plane within the point cloud data. The generated heightmap - in image form - is then used as an input for the CNN to detect a human body lying on the ground. To train the neural network, we propose a novel sim-to-real approach, in which the network model is trained using synthetic data obtained in simulation and then tested on real sensor data. To make the model transferable to real data implementations, during the training we adopt specific data augmentation strategies with the synthetic training data. The experimental results show that data augmentation introduced during the training process is essential for improving the performance of the trained model on real data. More specifically, the results demonstrate that the data augmentations on raw point-cloud data have contributed to a considerable improvement of the trained model performance.",60015150,Imperial College London,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.916666666666668,0.1871794871794872,0.4048076923076923,1

We aim to design a robust system to extract spatiotemporal features with aggregation mechanism to integrate local features in temporal order. In light of this, we propose ResFlow to estimate optical flow and predict action recognition simultaneously. Leveraging the characteristic of optical flow estimation, we extract spatiotemporal feature via an autoencoder. Via a novel Sequentially Pooling Mechanism which literally pool global spatiotemporal feature sequentially, we extract spatiotemporal feature at each time and aggregate these local features into global feature. This design use only RGB images as input with temporal information encoded, pre-trained by optical flow, and sequentially aggregate spatiotemporal features in high efficiency.

In addition, most of them assume nodes are static, i.e., fixed on one place and cannot be applied to dynamic environments where some or all of nodes are moving. To address the aforementioned issues, a cooperative dynamic RO-SLAM (CDRO-SLAM) is proposed in this paper, which is a RO-SLAM algorithm based on sum of Gaussian (SoG) filter with cooperative measurements in dynamic environments. The proposed CDRO-SLAM integrates all the inter-node measurements for localization, which results in a smaller map estimation error with a faster convergence speed than the conventional ROSLAM. Moreover, the proposed CDRO-SLAM can also track movement of any nodes under the dynamic environment by resetting and updating the SoG variables.

1664,1664,Flight Recovery of MAVs with Compromised IMU,"Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) rely on onboard attitude and position sensors for autonomous flight. Due to their size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints, most modern MAVs use miniaturized inertial measurement units (IMUs) to provide attitude feedback, which is critical for flight stabilization and control. However, recent adversarial attack studies have demonstrated that many commonly used IMUs are vulnerable to attacks exploiting their physical characteristics. Conventional redundancy-based approaches are not effective against such attacks because redundant IMUs have the same or similar physical vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a novel fault-tolerant solution for IMU compromised scenarios, using separate position and heading information to restore the failed attitude states. Rather than adding more IMU alternatives for recovery, the proposed method is intended to minimize any modifications to the existing system and control program. Thus, it is particularly useful for vehicles that have tight SWaP constraints while requiring simultaneous high performance and safety demands. To execute the recovery logic properly, a robust estimator was designed for fine-grained detection and isolation of the faulty sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated on a quadcopter MAV through both simulation and experimental flight tests.",109496410,Purdue University,Lafayette,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.22222222222222,0.016542857142857147,0.3687428571428571,1

Recently, advances in neural network-trained word embeddings have empowered non-embodied text-processing algorithms, and suggest they could be of similar utility for embodied machines. Here we introduce a method that does so by training robots to act similarly to semantically-similar word 2vec encoded commands.

The commonly employed solution is based on the attachment of a gripper on a robot. This paper introduces a new eight degrees of freedom (DoF) mechanism intended for two-fingered dexterous manipulation. The eight DoFs are obtained via a parallel architecture moved by eight actuators that are attached to the base of the robot. The novelty lies in the use of a 2-DoF configurable platform that insures two relative rotations of the gripper jaws (opening and twisting) in addition to the 6-DoF Cartesian movements.

Skin diseases may be caused by fungal infection, bacteria, allergy, or viruses, etc. The advancement of lasers and Photonics based medical technology has made it possible to diagnose the skin diseases much more quickly and accurately. But the cost of such diagnosis is still limited and very expensive. So, image processing techniques help to build automated screening system for dermatology at an initial stage. The extraction of features plays a key role in helping to classify skin diseases. Computer vision has a role in the detection of skin diseases in a variety of techniques. Due to deserts and hot weather, skin diseases are common in Saudi Arabia. This work contributes in the research of skin disease detection. We proposed an image processing-based method to detect skin diseases. This method takes the digital image of disease effect skin area, then use image analysis to identify the type of disease. Our proposed approach is simple, fast and does not require expensive equipment other than a camera and a computer. The approach works on the inputs of a color image. Then resize the of the image to extract features using pretrained convolutional neural network. After that classified feature using Multiclass SVM. Finally, the results are shown to the user, including the type of disease, spread, and severity.

1668,1668,Information Filter Occupancy Mapping using Decomposable Radial Kernels,"Building occupancy maps of the environment is a fundamental problem for robot autonomy. A common assumption in early work was that the occupancy states of different map elements are independent. Recently, Gaussian Process (GP) techniques were proposed to capture correlation, which is important not only for improved accuracy but also for uncertainty quantification and autonomous exploration based on the predicted occupancy of nearby unexplored areas. Despite these desirable properties, current GP mapping techniques are limited to small maps and slow inference speeds. This paper proposes an information space formulation of the GP mapping problem. If a decomposable radial kernel is evaluated over a latent grid of pseudo-input points, the resulting kernel matrix has a Kronecker-product-of-Toeplitz-matrices structure that allows very efficient representation of the occupancy distribution. We utilize this structure to design an information filter occupancy mapping algorithm with linear time and memory complexity that still permits continuous space observations and predictions.",60121655,The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department,San Diego,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.571428571428573,0.013736263736263743,0.47060439560439565,1

The classic challenges in the information acquisition problem are the dependence of a planning algorithm on known models and the difficulty of computing information-theoretic cost functions over arbitrary distributions. In contrast, the proposed framework of reinforcement learning does not require any knowledge on models and alleviates the problems during an extended training stage. It results in policies that are efficient to execute online and applicable for real-time control of robotic systems. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art planning methods are typically restricted to short horizons, which may become problematic with local minima. Reinforcement learning naturally handles the issue of planning horizon in information problems as it maximizes a discounted sum of rewards over a long finite or infinite time horizon. We discuss the potential benefits of the proposed framework and compare the performance of the novel algorithm to an existing information acquisition method for multi-target tracking scenarios.",60007776,Cornell University,Ithaca,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.285714285714285,-0.02833333333333334,0.41666666666666663,1

The framework extends the stochastic shortest path (SSP) model to dynamic environments in which it is impossible to determine the exact goal states ahead of plan execution. GUSSPs introduce flexibility in goal specification by allowing a belief over possible goal configurations. The unique observations at potential goals helps the agent identify the true goal during plan execution. The partial observability is restricted to goals, facilitating the reduction to an SSP with a modified state space. We formally define a GUSSP and discuss its theoretical properties. We then propose an admissible heuristic that reduces the planning time using FLARES - a start-of-the-art probabilistic planner. We also propose a determinization approach for solving this class of problems.

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the online construction of a map during exploration of an environment. One of the components of SLAM is loop closure detection, identifying that the same location has been visited and is present on the existing map, and localizing against it. We have shown in previous work that using semantics from a deep segmentation network in conjunction with the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) point cloud registration improves the robustness, speed and accuracy of lidar odometry. In this work we extend the method for loop closure detection, using the labels already available from local registration into NDT Histograms, and we present a SLAM pipeline based on Semantic assisted NDT and PointNet ++.

Spectrum Sensing (SS) is the core process in CR engine based on detecting the free channels and sharing it among other users. In wideband spectrum, many algorithms are proposed to sense the available free channels. Cooperative sensing is mainly considered as an effective solution of signal fading and shadowing problems in CR networks. From another side, CR networks can utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for dynamically sensing and decision making processes. In this paper, a blind adaptive spectrum sensing algorithm based over centralized cooperative sensing platform is proposed. Then, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interference System (ANFIS) technique is applied in decision-making process to achieve the optimum and accurate decisions. The simulation process and the output results showed that, the proposed technique outperforms both a standalone sensing techniques and other cooperative sensing with conventional decision making algorithms regarding to the probability of false alarms, probability of detection and probability of missed detection especially in low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).

Typically, There are many algorithms that plan footstep to avoid obstacles based on vision recognition data. However, if the robot is pushed, the planned footprint will change, and thus, there is no guarantee that it will avoid obstacles. Although modified stepping positions can be limited, the robot's stability is not assured. Our proposed algorithm focuses on avoiding obstacles through vision recognition in push recovery situations and generating compensation actions for instability by restricting modified footsteps. We fuse vision feedback with our previous push recovery algorithm, which optimizes the ankle, hip, and stepping strategies. We build simple grid data using vision recognition and apply it to the inequality constraint of the stepping position.

1677,1677,Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Concurrent Discovery of Compound and Composable Policies,"A common strategy to deal with the expensive reinforcement learning (RL) of complex tasks is to decompose them into a collection of subtasks that are usually simpler to learn as well as reusable for new problems. However, when a robot learns the policies for these subtasks, common approaches treat every policy learning process separately. Therefore, all these individual (composable) policies need to be learned before tackling the learning process of the complex task through policies composition. Moreover, such composition of individual policies is usually performed sequentially, which is not suitable for tasks that require to perform the subtasks concurrently. In this paper, we propose to combine a set of composable Gaussian policies corresponding to these subtasks using a set of activation vectors, resulting in a complex Gaussian policy that is a function of the means and covariances matrices of the composable policies. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for learning both compound and composable policies within the same learning process by exploiting the off-policy data generated from the compound policy. The algorithm is built on a maximum entropy RL approach to favor exploration during the learning process. The results of the experiments show that the experience collected with the compound policy permits not only to solve the complex task but also to obtain useful composable policies that successfully perform in their corresponding subtasks.",60121711,Università degli Studi di Genova - Dibris,Genoa,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",27.75,-0.10492424242424242,0.46553030303030307,1

The proximity to humans and the possibility to physically interact with them highlights the importance of developing secure robot applications. It is crucial to consider security implications to be an important part of the robot application's development process. Adding security later in the application's life-cycle usually leads to high costs, or is not possible due to earlier design decisions. In this work, we present the Robot Application Security Process (RASP) as a lightweight process that enables the development of secure robot applications. Together with RASP we introduce the role of a Security Engineer (SecEng) as an important stakeholder in any robot application development process.

Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem is often formulated for these inspection applications because of the coverage requirement. Traditionally, researchers usually plan and optimize the viewpoints to capture the surface information first, and then optimize the path to visit the selected viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a novel planning method to directly sample and plan the inspection path for a camera-equipped UAV to acquire visual and geometric information of the target structures as a video stream setting in complex 3D environment. The proposed planning method first generates via-points and path primitives around the target object by using sampling methods based on voxel dilation and subtraction. A novel Primitive Coverage Graph (PCG) is then proposed to encode the topological information, flying distances, and visibility information, with the sampled via-points and path primitives. Finally graph search is performed to find the resultant path in the PCG to complete the inspection task with the coverage requirements.

In the context of trajectory optimization, the feasibility of paths can change as the environment evolves. Therefore, it can be beneficial to reason about multiple possible paths simultaneously. We build on prior work that considers graph-based trajectories to find solutions in multiple homotopy classes concurrently. Specifically, we extend this previous work to an online setting where the unreachable (in time) part of the graph is pruned and the remaining graph is reoptimized at every time step. As the robot moves within the graph on the path that is most promising, the pruning and reoptimization allows us to retain candidate paths that may become more viable in the future (a) as the environment changes, essentially enabling the robot to dynamically switch between numerous homotopy classes.

To study the mental state of patients is necessary. A new assistive approach using emotion evaluation combined with an assistive walking device to maintain motivation during the rehabilitation is proposed. To realize it, the walking-emotion relationship within personal walking limitation (PWL) was explored at first. The results showed that when people walked by following the personal preferred walking ratio (PPWR), they were evoked the arousal emotion and kept the current valence emotion simultaneously; however, when people were not following PPWR to walk, the negative emotion was elicited. After that, subject was required to wear the assistive walking device to conduct the test, which aims to observe the emotion variation when subject walked at specific walking gait with an assistive device. We then are according to current emotion state to tune device. The findings show if people mistakenly use the device, unpleasant feeling would be elicited. When we properly tuning assistive device conforms to current gait, it can validly alleviate the negative emotion further becoming the positive emotion. From these results, we conclude that emotion can be affected by walking. By using walking-emotion evaluation to an assistive device, we can be according to users' emotion to control device; also, we can use an assistive device to inspire users' emotion to further maintain motivation. Finally, this assistive approach provides a useful treatment way for serving rehabilitation.",60023462,Waseda University,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.416666666666668,0.0051964085297418645,0.4135185185185185,1

While existing simulators support most real-world robots with serially linked kinematic and dynamic chains, they offer limited or conditional support for complex closed-loop robots. On the other hand, many of the underlying physics computation libraries that these simulators employ support closed-loop kinematic chains and redundant mechanisms. Such mechanisms are often utilized in surgical robots to achieve constrained motions (e.g., the remote center of motion (RCM)). To deal with such robots, we propose a new simulation framework based on a front-end description format and a robust real-time dynamic simulator.

To understand the difference in performance between these CPFAs, we define the price of ignorance and show how this metric explains our previously published empirical results. We obtain upper-bounds for expected complete collection times for each algorithm and evaluate their performance in simulation.

1688,1688,Fast Manipulability Maximization Using Continuous-Time Trajectory optimization,"A significant challenge in manipulation motion planning is to ensure agility in the face of unpredictable changes during task execution. This requires the identification and possible modification of suitable joint-space trajectories, since the joint velocities required to achieve a specific endeffector motion vary with manipulator configuration. For a given manipulator configuration, the joint space-to-task space velocity mapping is characterized by a quantity known as the manipulability index. In contrast to previous control-based approaches, we examine the maximization of manipulability during planning as a way of achieving adaptable and safe joint space-to-task space motion mappings in various scenarios. By representing the manipulator trajectory as a continuous-time Gaussian process (GP), we are able to leverage recent advances in trajectory optimization to maximize the manipulability index during trajectory generation. Moreover, the sparsity of our chosen representation reduces the typically large computational cost associated with maximizing manipulability when additional constraints exist.

For localization and mapping, we employ an efficient direct tracking on the truncated signed distance function (TSDF) and leverage color information encoded in the TSDF to estimate the pose of the sensor.

For detecting dynamics, we exploit the residuals obtained after an initial registration, together with the explicit modeling of free space in the model. We evaluate our approach on existing datasets, and provide a new dataset showing highly dynamic scenes.

The incoming speech signal is digitized with an event-driven A/D converter (EDADC). The output of EDADC is windowed with an activity selection process. These windows are later on resampled uniformly with an adaptive rate interpolator. The resampled windows are de-noised with an adaptive rate filter and their spectrum are computed with an adaptive resolution short time Fourier transform (ARSTFT). Later on, the magnitude, Delta and Delta-Delta spectral coefficients are extracted. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) technique is employed to compare these extracted features with the reference templates. The comparison outcomes are the classification decisions. The classification decision is transformed into a systematic sign. The system functionality is tested for a case study and results are presented. A 7.9times reduction in acquired number of samples is achieved by the devised approach as compared to the classical one. It aptitudes a significant computational gain and power consumption reduction of the proposed system over the counter classical ones. An average subject dependent isolated speech recognition accuracy of 96.6% is achieved. It shows that the proposed approach can be employed in potential applications like industrial and noisy environments, integration of people with impaired hearing, etc.",60107224,"Effat University, Saudi Arabia",Jeddah,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],16.066666666666666,0.07271825396825397,0.36259920634920634,0

Specifically, Period-l (P1) and Period -2 (P2) orbits are geometrically characterized in the state space of the H-LIP. Stepping controllers are designed for global stabilization of the orbits. Valid ranges of the gains and their optimality are derived. The optimal stepping controller is used to create and stabilize the walking of bipedal robots. An actuated Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (aSLIP) model and the underactuated robot Cassie are used for illustration. Both the aSLIP walking with PI or P2 orbits and the Cassie walking with all 3D compositions of the PI and P2 orbits can be smoothly generated and stabilized from a stepping-in-place motion.

In order to assist with daily tasks such as fetching a beverage, a service robot must be able to perceive its environment and generate corresponding motion trajectories. This becomes a challenging and computationally complex problem when the environment is unknown and thus the path planner must sample numerous trajectories that often are sub-optimal, extending the execution time. To address this issue, we propose a unique strategy of integrating a 3D object detection pipeline with a kinematically optimal manipulation planner to significantly increase speed performance at run-time.

Determining the Association of Individuals and the Collective Social Space,"The increasing use of autonomous mobile robots in different parts of society, and not restricted only to industrial environments, makes it important to propose techniques that will allow them to behave in the most socially acceptable way as possible. In most real-world scenarios, individuals in the environment are interacting with each other and are arranged into groups. Therefore, it is paramount the proposition of techniques to efficiently and correctly identify and represent such groups. This information can be useful in different tasks such as approaching and initiating an interaction, escorting, and the navigation itself. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based approach to evaluate the possible association of individuals in the environment based on their position and body orientation.

1695,1695,Discovery of resources over cloud using MADM approaches," All rights reserved.Cloud and P2P computing allows the sharing of resources among its users from diverse geographical locations. The resources are heterogeneous in nature and possess distinct attributes. The majority of the existing techniques rely on the static attributes during resource selection. However, the matching of resources based on static attributes may not be the best for the execution of user jobs. The resources could be very attractive as per the static configuration but might be heavily loaded with other multiple jobs since the working memory and storage space might have already been utilized. Hence, there is a need to consider the dynamic state of the resources in order to locate the most suitable resources for user jobs. In this paper, a 2-phased multi-attribute decision making (MADM) mechanism is proposed to locate the appropriate resources. The first phase explains a mechanism to discover all the matched resources and the second phase then applies the PROMETHEE MADM approach on the set of resources to find the most suitable resource for the user job.

The hybrid vision system serves to control the actuator position through the robotic platform to make the trapped microrobot undergo a planned trajectory. In first validation results, the particle driving is achieved in open loop with no adjustment with respect to the planned trajectory.

1698,1698,Constrained Heterogeneous Vehicle Path Planning for Large-area Coverage,"There is a strong demand for covering a large area autonomously by multiple UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) supported by a ground vehicle. Limited by UAVs' battery life and communication distance, complete coverage of large areas typically involves multiple take-offs and landings to recharge batteries, and the transportation of UAVs between operation areas by a ground vehicle. In this paper, we introduce a novel large-area-coverage planning framework which collectively optimizes the paths for aerial and ground vehicles. Our method first partitions a large area into sub-areas, each of which a given fleet of UAVs can cover without recharging batteries. UAV operation routes, or trails, are then generated for each sub-area. Next, the assignment of trials to different UAVs and the order in which UAVs visit their assigned trails are simultaneously optimized to minimize the total UAV flight distance. Finally, a ground vehicle transportation path which visits all sub-areas is found by solving an asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). Although finding the globally optimal trail assignment and transition paths can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP), the MIQP is intractable even for small problems. We show that the solution time can be reduced to close-to-real-time levels by first finding a feasible solution using a Random Key Genetic Algorithm (RKGA), which is then locally optimized by solving a much smaller MIQP.",60027950,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.555555555555557,0.03127705627705628,0.3967532467532467,1

In this paper we investigate the concept of feature map filtering, where, rather than using all the activations within a convolutional tensor, only the most useful activations are used. Since specific feature maps encode different visual features, the objective is to remove feature maps that detract from the ability to recognize a location across appearance changes. Our key innovation is to filter the feature maps in an early convolutional layer, but then continue to run the network and extract a feature vector using a later, more viewpoint invariant layer in the same network. Our approach improves the condition and viewpoint invariance of a pre-trained network, using as little as a single training image pair from the deployment environment. An exhaustive experimental analysis is performed to determine the full scope of causality between early layer filtering and late layer extraction. For validity, we use three datasets: Oxford RobotCar, Nordland, and Gardens Point, achieving overall superior performance to NetVLAD.

1700,1700,Rolling-Shutter Modelling for Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry,"We present a direct visual-inertial odometry (VIO) method which estimates the motion of the sensor setup and sparse 3D geometry of the environment based on measurements from a rolling-shutter camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The visual part of the system performs a photometric bundle adjustment on a sparse set of points. This direct approach does not extract feature points and is able to track not only corners, but any pixels with sufficient gradient magnitude. Neglecting rolling-shutter effects in the visual part severely degrades accuracy and robustness of the system. In this paper, we incorporate a rolling-shutter model into the photometric bundle adjustment that estimates a set of recent keyframe poses and the inverse depth of a sparse set of points. IMU information is accumulated between several frames using measurement preintegration, and is inserted into the optimization as an additional constraint between selected keyframes. For every keyframe we estimate not only the pose but also velocity and biases to correct the IMU measurements. Unlike systems with global-shutter cameras, we use both IMU measurements and rolling-shutter effects of the camera to estimate velocity and biases for every state. Last, we evaluate our system on a new dataset that contains global-shutter and rolling-shutter images, IMU data and ground-truth poses for ten different sequences, which we make publicly available. Evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms a system where rolling shutter is not modelled and achieves similar accuracy to the global-shutter method on global-shutter data.",60019722,Technical University of Munich,Munich,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.3,0.07727272727272727,0.3497632575757576,1

Furthermore, caging also provides useful guarantees in terms of robustness to uncertainty, and often serves as a way-point to a grasp. However, caging is traditionally difficult to integrate as part of larger manipulation frameworks, where caging is not the goal but an intermediate condition. In this paper, we develop a convex-combinatorial model to characterize caging from an optimization perspective. More specifically, we derive a set of sufficient constraints to enclose the configuration of the object in a compact-connected component of its free-space. The convex-combinatorial nature of this approach provides guarantees on optimality and convergence, and its optimization nature makes it versatile for further applications on robot manipulation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first optimization-based approach to formulate the caging condition.",60022195,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.857142857142858,0.20555555555555557,0.44814814814814813,1

The motivation of achieving assembly of actual cells lies in the great significance of it in tissue regeneration and cell analysis. Firstly, the most difficult problem we need to solve is the releasing problem caused by adhesion force. The viscosity on cell surface is much larger than the microbeads which makes cell releasing challenging. Secondly, the cell can generate its deformation, then contact area with end-effector will change during grasping process. This may influence the adhesion force and also bring problem to releasing. Thirdly, cell is much smaller, around 15μm in diameter, so we need to fabricate smaller end-effector to achieve successful manipulation and ensure the stability in the meantime. In this paper, we realize the manipulation by decreasing the adhesion forces and apply vibration to release a cell stably. We found the appropriate scale size for the end-effector is around 10μm diameter. It can not only grasp a 15μm cell but also bring little interference to the environment. As a demonstration of the proposed manipulation method, the repeated experiments were conducted to explore the dependence of adhesion force on the grasping distance, which can be helpful in the improvement of successful rate.

While dedicated force-torque (FT) sensors are a common option, such devices induce extra costs, need additional power supply, and add weight to otherwise light-weight robotic systems. This paper presents a machine learning approach for estimating external forces acting on a robot based on common internal sensors only. In the training phase, a behavior-specific proprioceptive model is learned as compact representation of the expected proprioceptive feedback during task execution. First, the proprioceptive sensors relevant for the given behavior are identified using information-theoretic measures. Then, the proprioceptive model is learned using deep learning techniques.

Most of these AAN controllers require a patient-specific manual tuning of the parameters defining the underlying force-field, which typically results in a tedious and time-consuming process. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based impedance controller that actively reshapes the stiffness of the force-field to the subject's performance, while providing assistance only when needed. This adaptability is made possible by correlating the subject's most recent performance to the ultimate control objective in real-time. In addition, the proposed controller is built upon action dependent heuristic dynamic programming using the actor-critic structure, and therefore does not require prior knowledge of the system model.

1705,1705,Toward a Human-Machine Interface Based on Electrical Impedance Tomography for Robotic Manipulator Control,"In this study, we proposed a novel human-machine interface (HMI) for robotic manipulator control. The specific target was to adjust the impedance coefficients of the robot controller in real time by measuring the human forearm muscle contractions. We firstly designed a HMI system. Different from the frequently used sEMG technologies, the interface in our study could detect muscle morphological changes within the skin by the electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The sensing front-end was a soft elastic fabric band which was compatible to different arm shapes. With the specific designed sensing hardware and the re-construction algorithms, EIT images indicating forearm muscle shapes were obtained. We then designed a hybrid positon/impedance controller on a UR5 with the impedance coefficients being tuned in real time by the grasp force estimation. A sigmoid regression algorithm was used to map the EIT images to the grasp forces. After implementation of the whole system, two experiments were carried out. The first experiment was the off-line grasp force estimation. With the 1:1 cross validation, an average R2 of 0.83 \pm 0.04 and an average of the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 0.31 \pm 0.10 across 5 subjects were yielded. The second experiment was the real-time robot control. Trajectory tracking task with dynamic uncertainties were investigated and grasp forces were estimated in real-time. With higher muscle contraction levels, smaller position errors were observed and shorter time was needed to return to the expected trajectory when there were external disturbances.

Reasoning about the motions of robots and objects simultaneously leads to a constrained planning problem in a high-dimensional state-space. Additionally, when environments change dynamically motions must be computed in real-time.To this end, we propose a feedback planner for manipulation. We model manipulation as constrained motion and use this model to automatically derive a set of constraint-based controllers. These controllers are used in a switching-control scheme, where the active controller is chosen by a reinforcement learning agent.

From this point of view, control to minimize rate of change of angular momentum about Center of Mass (CoM) which is produced by ground reaction force (GRF) at contact of robot's foot is necessary. Using this approach, direct force-based Zero Moment Point (ZMP) for motion planning of the CoM and landing force control are implemented. The direct force-based ZMP method allows the robot to lift its foot with reduced possibility of tilting on the stairs, and the landing force control prevents instant increase of the moment by impact of the GRFs. In addition, terrain recognition to estimate parameters of the stairs and find proper footholds by vision system mounted on the robot is presented.

A gait transition is accordingly stable (as in 'the robot does not fall if the biped's state is within the reduced region of attraction of the switched-in gait when switching takes place. Two- and five-link biped models complete a sequence of random gait transitions using the switching logic. The condition is also used to enlarge the full region of stability of the five-link model by embedding feedback-stabilized trajectories from a gait library in a mapping. The mapping stitches stable trajectories to the orbit of the desired gait based on each gait's reduced region of attraction.

1716,1716,"Guinea fowl Jumping Robot with Balance Control Mechanism: Modeling, simulation, and experiment results","Recently, diverse research has actively been conducted to control the posture of jumping robots using an inertial tail mechanism. However, the inertial tail mechanism has a high probability of collision with obstacles. In this study, a momentum wheel mechanism is proposed to achieve the same attitude control performance while reducing the volume occupied by the inertial tail mechanism. To verify the performance of the momentum wheel mechanism, we proposed a jumping robot with a momentum wheel mechanism and performed a dynamic analysis, simulation, and experiments on a jumping robot with a momentum wheel mechanism. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the momentum wheel mechanism can contribute to control of the body angle of the jumping robot. As a result, the momentum wheel mechanism can enhance the stability of the jumping robot more than the tail mechanism, and the momentum wheel mechanism contributes to the attitude control of the body angle, which allows the jumping robot to perform continuous jumping.",60092864,Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology,Daegu,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.666666666666668,0.0680952380952381,0.31166666666666665,1

Under such conditions, tactile and somatosensory information are useful for object recognition during manipulation. Humans can visualize the appearance of invisible objects from only the somatosensory information provided by their hands. In this paper, we propose a method to generate an image of an invisible object's posture from the joint angles and touch information provided by robot fingers while touching the object. We show that the object's posture can be estimated from the time-series of the joint angles of the robot hand via regression analysis. In addition, conditional generative adversarial networks can generate an image to show the appearance of the invisible objects from their estimated postures.

JISAP was evaluated with a dataset of twelve surgeons operating on the da Vinci Skills Simulator.

We propose the depth perception dependency test, which is the combination of tests of a motion and depth perception based on the situation that an object is placed on the human's pathway. Firstly, as the motion test, we set the ball approach motion and asked elderly participants to approach and contact a ball by their foot, because this motion is easy to measure and requires localization skill and motion planning skill. The swing/support legs positions at the toeoff time of the swing leg just before contacting the ball was analyzed. Secondly, as the depth perception test, the pseudo3D image test was proposed. The coordinate transformation model for the calculation of the depth perception ability was also proposed. Through the proposed test and the proposed model, it was clarified that the participants who are regarded as perceiving the strong visual illusion perceive the objects closer than its real position, and their swing leg toe off positions in the ball approaching motion were significantly farther than other participants. Thus, it can be concluded that there was a relationship between the depth perception and the approaching motion that is thought to be a higher risk of stumbles.",60025272,University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.5,0.13974358974358975,0.31153846153846154,1

The proposed algorithm consists of spatial motion segmentation and temporal motion tracking. The spatial segmentation first generates several motion hypotheses by using a grid-based scene flow and clusters the extracted motion hypotheses, separating objects that move independently of one another. Further, we use a dual-mode motion model to consistently distinguish between the static and dynamic parts in the temporal motion tracking stage. Finally, the proposed algorithm estimates the pose of a camera by taking advantage of the region classified as static parts. In order to evaluate the performance of visual odometry under the existence of dynamic rigid objects, we use self-collected dataset containing RGB-D images and motion capture data for ground-truth. We compare our algorithm with state-of-the-art visual odometry algorithms.

Generally, it is not feasible for a person to provide demonstrations that account for all possible variations in non-trivial tasks. While there are many learning methods that can handle interpolation of observed data effectively, extrapolation from observed data offers a much greater challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a modified Task-Parameterised Gaussian Mixture Regression method that considers the relevance of task parameters during trajectory generation, as determined by variance in the data. The benefits of the proposed method are first explored using a simulated reaching task data set. Here it is shown that the proposed method offers far-reaching, low-error extrapolation abilities that are different in nature to existing learning methods. Data collected from novice users for a real-world manipulation task is then considered, where it is shown that the proposed method is able to effectively reduce grasping performance errors by \sim 40% and extrapolate to unseen grasp targets under real-world conditions. These results indicate the proposed method can benefit novice users by placing less reliance on the user to provide high quality demonstration data sets.",60011520,King's College London,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.0,0.23987179487179489,0.4819230769230769,1

The presence of outliers has a huge impact on modelling the acquired data, resulting in inappropriate models. In this work a novel approach for outlier detection and rejection for input/output mapping in regression problems is presented.

There are two main challenges for close proximity flights: (i) the trust characteristics varies drastically for the different distance from the ceiling which results in a complex nonlinear dynamics; (ii) the system needs to consider physical and environmental constraints to safely fly in close proximity. To address these challenges, a novel framework consisting of a constrained optimization-based force estimation and an optimization-based nonlinear controller is proposed. Experimental results illustrate that the performance of the proposed control approach can stabilize UAV down to 1 cm distance to the ceiling. Furthermore, we report that the UAV consumes up to 12.5% less power when it is operated 1 cm distance to ceiling, which is promising potential for more battery-efficient inspection flights.",60031307,School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",30.4,0.09246031746031748,0.5189342403628118,1
1726,1726,Interaction-aware Decision Making with Adaptive Strategies under Merging Scenarios,"In order to drive safely and efficiently under merging scenarios, autonomous vehicles should be aware of their surroundings and make decisions by interacting with other road participants. Moreover, different strategies should be made when the autonomous vehicle is interacting with drivers having different level of cooperativeness. Whether the vehicle is on the merge-lane or main-lane will also influence the driving maneuvers since drivers will behave differently when they have the right-of-way than otherwise. Many traditional methods have been proposed to solve decision making problems under merging scenarios. However, these works either are incapable of modeling complicated interactions or require implementing hand-designed rules which cannot properly handle the uncertainties in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we proposed an interaction-aware decision making with adaptive strategies (IDAS) approach that can let the autonomous vehicle negotiate the road with other drivers by leveraging their cooperativeness under merging scenarios. A single policy is learned under the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting via the curriculum learning strategy, which enables the agent to automatically infer other drivers' various behaviors and make decisions strategically. A masking mechanism is also proposed to prevent the agent from exploring states that violate common sense of human judgment and increase the learning efficiency.

In tasks where avoiding singularity is critical to success, this paper provides an approach, especially for non-expert users, for the system to learn the constraints contained in a set of demonstrations, such that they can be used to optimise an autonomous controller to avoid singularity, without having to explicitly know them. The proposed approach avoids singularity, and thereby unpredictable behaviour when carrying out a task, by maximising the learnt manipulability throughout the motion of the constrained system, and is not limited to kinematic systems. Its benefits are demonstrated through comparisons with other control policies which show that the constrained manipulability of a system learnt through demonstration can be used to avoid singularities in cases where these other policies would fail. In the absence of the system's manipulability subject to a task's constraints, the proposed approach can be used instead to infer these with results showing errors less than 10^{-5} in 3DOF simulated systems and less than 10^{-2} using a 7DOF real world robotic system.",60011520,King's College London,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",37.8,-0.04079131652661064,0.37408963585434174,1

Due to redundancy in such high-DOF grippers, there exists a large number of equally effective grasp poses for a given target object, making it difficult for the neural network to find consistent grasp poses. We resolve this ambiguity by generating an augmented dataset that covers many possible grasps for each target object and train our neural networks using a consistency loss function to identify a one-to-one mapping from objects to grasp poses. We further enhance the quality of neural-network-predicted grasp poses using a collision loss function to avoid penetrations. We use an object dataset that combines the BigBIRD Database, the KIT Database, the YCB Database, and the Grasp Dataset to show that our method can generate high-DOF grasp poses with higher accuracy than supervised learning baselines. The quality of the grasp poses is on par with the groundtruth poses in the dataset.

However, functional grasp synthesis for high degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic hands from object shape alone is challenging. We present ContactGrasp, a framework for functional grasp synthesis from object shape and contact on the object surface. Contact can be manually specified or obtained through demonstrations. Our contact representation is object-centric and allows functional grasp synthesis even for hand models different than the one used for demonstration.

The initial stages of DR can either show no symptoms or cause mild vision problems but advanced stages of the disease can cause blindness. The main cause of DR is high blood sugar in diabetic patients that affect the blood vessels supplying blood to the retina and blocks them. The body tries to grow new vessels to supply the retina, however, they usually don't develop properly and can easily leak. DR Detection is an extremely challenging task due to the variation of retina change throughout the disease stages.

1737,1737,An assistive low-vision platform that augments spatial cognition through proprioceptive guidance: Point-to-Tell-and-Touch,"Spatial cognition, as gained through the sense of vision, is one of the most important capabilities of human beings. However, for the visually impaired (VI), lack of this perceptual capability poses great challenges in their life. Therefore, we have designed Point-to-Tell-and-Touch, a wearable system with an ergonomic human-machine interface, for assisting the VI with active environmental exploration, with a particular focus on spatial intelligence and navigation to objects of interest in an alien environment. Our key idea is to link visual signals, as decoded synthetically, to the VI's proprioception for more intelligible guidance, in addition to vision-to-audio assistance, i.e., finger pose, as indicated by pointing, is used as 'proprioceptive laser pointer' to target an object in that line of sight. The whole system consists of two features, Point-to-Tell and Point-to-Touch, both of which can work independently or cooperatively. The Point-to-Tell feature contains a camera with a novel one-stage neural network tailored for blind-centered object detection and recognition, and a headphone telling the VI the semantic label and distance from the pointed object. the Point-to-Touch, the second feature, leverages a vibrating wrist band to create a haptic feedback tool that supplements the initial vectorial guidance provided by the first stage (hand pose being direction and the distance being the extent, offered through audio cues). Both platform features utilize proprioception or joint position sense. Through hand pose, the VI end user knows where he or she is pointing relative to their egocentric coordinate system and we are able to use this foundation to build spatial intelligence. Our successful indoor experiments demonstrate the proposed system to be effective and reliable in helping the VI gain spatial cognition and explore the world in a more intuitive way.",60104576,NYU Abu Dhabi,Abu Dhabi,United Arab Emirates,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.3,0.22777777777777777,0.4412698412698413,1

This mechanism is composed of pure mechanical components such as coil springs, differential gear structure, and belt-pulley system.

Commercial surgical robots do not perform any sub-tasks - even of repetitive or noninvasive nature - autonomously or provide intelligent assistance. While this is primarily due to safety and regulatory reasons, the state of such automation intelligence also lacks the reliability and robustness for use in high-risk applications. Recent developments in continuous control using Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning have prompted growing research interest in automating mundane sub-tasks. To build on this, we present an inspired Asynchronous Framework which incorporates realtime dynamic simulation - manipulable with the masters of a surgical robot and various other input devices - and interfaces with learning agents to train and potentially allow for the execution of shared sub-tasks. The scope of this framework is generic to cater to various surgical (as well as non-surgical) training and control applications. This scope is demonstrated by examples of multi-user and multi-manual applications which allow for realistic interactions by incorporating distributed control, shared task allocation and a well-defined communication pipe-line for learning agents.

This paper presents an exploration framework built upon segment-aided pose SLAM adapted for better active localization. We build on our previous work on expectation maximization (EM) exploration, which explicitly models unknown landmarks as latent variables and predicts their expected uncertainty, to resolve the lack of landmark state in denser instances of SLAM. The proposed system comprises path generation, place recognition forecasting, belief propagation and utility evaluation using a virtual map.

While generative models have been explored on many types of data, little work has been done on synthesizing lidar scans, which play a key role in robot mapping and localization. In this work, we show that one can adapt deep generative models for this task by unravelling lidar scans into a 2D point map. Our approach can generate high quality samples, while simultaneously learning a meaningful latent representation of the data. We demonstrate significant improvements against state-of-the-art point cloud generation methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel data representation that augments the 2D signal with absolute positional information.

1743,1743,Empowered Optical Inspection by Using Robotic Manipulator in Industrial Applications,"Nowadays the inspection of products at the end of line represents a critical phase. At this stage, it is necessary to look for defects in order to prevent the quality check to fail, and to provide information for improving the production as well. This task can be performed by using several sensing technologies, and the contactless optical inspection plays a key role. In this regard, the use of advanced robotic manipulators offers the capability to change the viewpoint of a given object and to inspect its multiple faces. We propose an approach that combines the use of photometric stereo to derive a 3D model of objects, empowered by the super-resolution that is applied on the original dataset (upstream) or on the normal images (downstream) in order to increase the quality of the final 3D model. The vision system is mounted on a robotic manipulator, able to grasp and change the viewpoint, thus offering a more complete view of the object to be inspected. The obtained results show that the developed solution increases the quality of the derived 3D models used for inspection tasks on different faces of the objects; this is achieved by using the manipulation ability offered by the adopted robotic platform.",60031624,Università Politecnica delle Marche,Ancona,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",29.0,0.07500000000000001,0.48026315789473684,1

1745,1745,Toward Improving Patient Safety and Surgeon Comfort in a Synergic Robot-Assisted Eye Surgery: A Comparative Study,"When robotic assistance is present into vitreoretinal surgery, the surgeon will experience reduced sensory input that is otherwise derived from the tool's interaction with the eye wall (sclera). We speculate that disconnecting the surgeon from this sensory input may increase the risk of injury to the eye and affect the surgeon's usual technique. On the other hand, robot autonomous motion to enhance patient safety might inhibit the surgeons tool manipulation and diminish surgeon comfort with the procedure. In this study, to investigate the parameters of patient safety and surgeon comfort in a robot-assisted eye surgery, we implemented three different approaches designed to keep the scleral force in a safe range during a synergic eye manipulation task. To assess the surgeon comfort during these procedures, the amount of interference with the surgeons usual maneuvers has been analyzed by defining quantitative comfort metrics. The first two utilized scleral force control approaches are based on an adaptive force control method in which the robot actively counteracts any excessive force on the sclera. The third control method is based on a virtual fixture approach in which a virtual wall is created for the surgeon in the unsafe directions of manipulation. The performance of the utilized approaches was evaluated in user studies with two experienced retinal surgeons and the outcomes of the procedure were assessed using the defined safety and comfort metrics. Results of these analyses indicate the significance of the opted control paradigm on the outcome of a safe and comfortable robot-assisted eye surgery.",60015891,Wilmer Eye Institute,Baltimore,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",27.77777777777778,0.11611111111111111,0.46722222222222226,1

The key challenge is the fast on-board initialization of the visual odometry (VO) system, which usually requires user input to recover the visual scale. Our approach is based on the identification of the gravity vector from the acceleration data computed with images of the ground during in free fall. This enables scaling of the poses reconstructed with visual information. The proposed framework use inertial data to control the MAV attitude so the ground is visible after the throw. Using image to image homography a metric scale is estimated with which the MAV's height is propagated. Unlike existing literature, this approach requires no additional sensor nor user input or pre-throw assumptions and can recover from any initial attitude.

1747,1747,Energy Harvesting across Temporal Temperature Gradients using Vaporization,"Energy harvesting is an attractive alternative to carrying onboard power for mobile robots, especially for long duration missions. While solar is a powerful option, alternatives are needed for situations where direct sunlight is unavailable. One intriguing concept was proposed in the 17th century to power clocks: energy harvesting based on temporal, rather than spatial, temperature gradients, using a low boiling point fluid that vaporizes at ambient temperatures. This concept has many strengths: it offers all-in-one energy harvesting and storage; direct high-force and large displacement mechanical output, eliminating the need for a motor; and temporal gradients are ubiquitous, due to diurnal thermal fluctuations. The challenge for robotic applications, however, is to create large enough amounts of work in a small enough package to power a mobile device while using a non-toxic and readily available working fluid. Here we present a simple, low-cost energy harvesting actuator, powered by the vaporization of butane and isobutane, with an isobaric energy density of up to 38000J/m-{3} (i.e. energy extracted per total volume expansion) each time the temperature fluctuates 13.1°C, enough to power a small car to drive 10m. Two principles enable this: i) precompression of the working fluid, allowing us to tune the boiling point and choose among many non-toxic fluids that do more work than non-compressed fluids; and ii) a constant force profile of the return springs, allowing more work than a linear spring. We present a simple model of the actuator and experimental results characterizing its behavior. Our work lays the foundation for energy harvesting across temporal temperature gradients using vaporization as a viable option for powering mobile robots.",60029241,"University of California, Santa Barbara",Santa Barbara,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.6,0.1133403361344538,0.3979341736694679,1

The learning scheme is experimentally evaluated on an aggressive trajectory involving set point shifts of 60 degrees within 0.2 seconds.

1749,1749,Deep Learning-Based Mutual Detection and Collaborative Localization for Mobile Robot Fleets Using Solely 2D LIDAR Sensors,"Localization for mobile robots in dynamic, large-scale environments is a challenging task, especially when relying solely on odometry and 2D LIDAR data. When operating in fleets, mutual detection and the exchange of localization information can be highly valuable. Detecting and classifying different robot types in a heterogeneous fleet, however, is nontrivial with 2D LIDAR data due to the sparse observation information.In this paper a novel approach for mutual robot detection, classification and relative pose estimation based on a combination of convolutional and ConvLSTM layers is presented in order to solve this issue. The algorithm learns an end-to-end classification and pose estimation of robot shapes using 2D LIDAR information transformed into a grid-map. Subsequently a mixture model representing the probability distribution of the pose measurement for each robot type is extracted out of the heatmap output of the network. The output is then used in a cloud-based collaborative localization system in order to increase the localization of the individual robots.The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in both, simulation and real-world experiments. The results of our evaluation show that the classification network is able to achieve a precision of 90% on real-world data with an average position estimation error of 14 cm. Moreover, the collaborative localization system is able to increase the localization accuracy of a robot equipped with low-cost sensors by 63%.",60025167,Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA,Stuttgart,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",27.75,0.11541666666666668,0.4818055555555556,1
1750,1750,Employing Magnets to Improve the Force Exertion Capabilities of Adaptive Robot Hands in Precision Grasps,"Adaptive, underactuated and compliant robot hands have received an increased interest over the last decade. Possible applications of these systems range from the development of simple grippers for industrial automation to the creation of anthropomorphic devices that can be used as prosthetic hands. These hands are particularly capable of extracting stable grasps even under significant object pose or other environmental uncertainties, due to the underactuation and the structural compliance of their designs. Despite the increased interest and the promising performance, adaptive hands suffer from several disadvantages and drawbacks. For example, the use of underactuation can lead to a post-contact reconfiguration of the fingers that compromises the force exertion capabilities of the system during pinch grasping. In this paper, we focus on the design, modelling, development, and evaluation of an adaptive robot gripper that uses magnets to adjust the reconfiguration profile of the fingers. The effect of the magnets increases the gripper's force exertion capabilities in pinch grasps, without compromising the full / caging grasps. The efficiency of the proposed gripper is experimentally validated through two different tests: i) a contact force test that compares the results of a theoretical model with the actual experimental results and ii) a grasping test that assesses the force exertion capabilities and the reconfiguration behaviour of the adaptive fingers for different implementations of the magnetic joints.",60005686,University of Auckland,Auckland,New Zealand,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",27.625,0.0671875,0.4186755952380952,1

However, this joint optimization is considered as a computational bottleneck within the system, and thus many traditional VINS can only be implemented on platforms containing powerful processors. In this work, we show a significant reduction in the computational burden of optimization can be achieved through the use of fragments; a set of co-visible feature points from across several different cameras efficiently split, categorized into groups, and then analyzed using a machine-learning inspired frequent-pattern growth algorithm. Furthermore, we use a reduced continuous representation during preintegration for better accuracy while requiring less computational resources. We validate our algorithm in datasets, showing that the derivation is not only more accurate, but requires significantly less computational resources. When tested on a Raspberry Pi, our implementation was able to track the system's state in nearly 20 frames per second using only a single CPU core. Testing on another low power module shows a power draw of around 800 mW.

This paper formulates it as a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) and proposes a novel optimization approach to adjust step location and duration in real time. Based on state feedback, the Linear Inverted Pendulum dynamics is exploited to determine the optimal step parameters. Different from previous works, this work presents three main characteristics: i) the hyperbolic functions of step duration rather than the step duration itself are chosen to be optimization variables; ii) the approach can be switched from baseline two-steps-prediction optimization to one-step-prediction optimization through merely adding several equality constraints in problem formulation; iii) the approach can deal with relative step location tracking (velocity tracking) or absolute step location tracking (position tracking) via changing the reference step parameters. As a result, the first characteristic enables the NLP to be solved in a computational-efficient manner and the latter two endow the approach with versatility under different control modes.

We describe the hardware and software of a quadrotor system that meets these requirements with onboard processing: A custom 300 mm wide quadrotor that uses two wide-field-of-view cameras for visualinertial motion tracking and relocalization to a prior map. Collision-free trajectories are planned offline and tracked online with a custom tracking controller. This controller includes compensation for drag and variability in propeller performance, enabling accurate trajectory tracking, even at high speeds where aerodynamic effects are significant. We describe a system identification approach that identifies quadrotor-specific parameters via maximum likelihood estimation from flight data. Results from flight experiments are presented, which 1) validate the system identification method, 2) show that our controller with aerodynamic compensation reduces tracking error by more than 50% in both horizontal flights at up to 8.5 m/s and vertical flights at up to 3.1 m/s compared to the state-of-the-art, and 3) demonstrate our system tracking complex, aggressive, trajectories.",60031581,California Institute of Technology,Pasadena,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",27.857142857142858,0.194375,0.5485937500000001,1

However, the physical fatigue in the usage of such robot teleoperation interfaces may prevent this approach to be widely used in large scale by diverse workforce populations. As a result, this paper conducts a user study to investigate the physical fatigue of teleoperators in the whole-body motion mapping teleoperation of a mobile humanoid assistive robot. Through a Vicon motion capture system, participants teleoperated the robot to perform general purpose assistive tasks that involve reaching-to-grasp, bimanual manipulation, loco-manipulation and human-robot interaction. We assess the physical fatigue based on surface electromyography (sEMG) measurement, and compare it between different tasks and muscles. Our analysis results indicate that: (1) Fatigue happens more in the tasks that involve more precise manipulation and steady posture maintenance; (2) Deltoids, Biceps and Trapezius are used more for such tasks and thus have more fatigue than others.

The combination of soil penetrating spikes and a push-pull design offers new possibilities for vehicle control. By controlling the interlocking of the spikes and pushing and pulling them against the main frame, the vehicle can perform tight maneuvers. To validate this idea, we designed a robot, capable of creating high traction and performing headland turns. The navigation of the new robot system is performed by actively pushing the spikes, mounted on a slide into the soil, while the main frame is pushed back and pulled forward.

Inspired by the observation that humans continually adapt their behavior when interacting under varying social context, we propose Adaptive EXP4 (A-EXP4), a novel online learning algorithm for adapting the robot-pedestrian interaction policy. To address limitations of bandit algorithms in adaptation to unseen and highly dynamic scenarios, we employ a mixture model over the policy parameter space. Specifically, a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPMM) is used to cluster the parameters of sampled policies and maintain a mixture model over the clusters, hence effectively discovering policies that are suitable to the current environmental context in an unsupervised manner. Our simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility of A-EXP4 in accommodating interaction with different types of pedestrians while jointly minimizing social disruption through the adaptation process. While the A-EXP4 formulation is kept general for application in a variety of domains requiring continual adaptation of a robot's policy, we specifically evaluate the performance of our algorithm using a suitcase-inspired assistive robotic platform. In this concrete assistive scenario, the algorithm observes how audio signals produced by the navigational system affect the behavior of pedestrians and adapts accordingly. Consequently, we find A-EXP4 to effectively adapt the interaction policy for gently clearing a navigation path in crowded settings, resulting in significant reduction in empirical regret compared to the EXP4 baseline.",60104841,The Robotics Institute,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",29.875,0.14656862745098043,0.41715686274509806,1

We propose a framework to deal with limited labeled training data and demonstrate it on the application of vision-based vehicle control. We show how limited steering angle data available for only one condition can be transferred to multiple different weather scenarios. This is done by leveraging unlabeled images in a teacher-student learning paradigm complemented with an image-to-image translation network. The translation network transfers the images to a new domain, whereas the teacher provides soft supervised targets to train the student on this domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate how utilization of auxiliary networks can reduce the size of a model at inference time, without affecting the accuracy.

We present a hardware and software framework for an autonomous aerial robot, in which all software for autonomy can run onboard the drone, implemented in Python. We present an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for accurate state estimation. Next, we present an implementation of Monte Carlo (MC) Localization and FastSLAM for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The performance of UKF, localization, and SLAM is tested and compared to ground truth, provided by a motion-capture system.

Based on this architecture, robots can organize the perception and inference information efficiently and generate social friendly navigation strategies. In other words, robots are able to strengthen their perception and inference abilities to interact with domestic environment and users under our efficient framework. The main feature of this architecture is that the relations between layers can be viewed as affordances to improve the accuracy and the robustness of the detection and inference.

1767,1767,Eigen-Factors: Plane Estimation for Multi-Frame and Time-Continuous Point Cloud Alignment,"In this paper, we introduce the Eigen-Factor (EF) method, which estimates a planar surface from a set of point clouds (PCs), with the peculiarity that these points have been observed from different poses, i.e. the trajectory described by a sensor. We propose to use multiple Eigen-Factors (EFs) or different planes' estimations, that allow to solve the multi-frame alignment over a sequence of observed PCs. Moreover, the complexity of the EFs optimization is independent of the number of points, but depends on the number of planes and poses. To achieve this, a closed-form of the gradient is derived by differentiating over the minimum eigenvalue with respect to poses, hence the name Eigen-Factor. In addition, a time-continuous trajectory version of EFs is proposed. The EFs approach is evaluated on a simulated environment and compared with two variants of ICP, showing that it is possible to optimize over all point errors, improving both the accuracy and computational time.

The efficiency of these robots can be improved if they can perform some tasks while moving. In this paper, we propose the concept of mobile workstations, which combine mobile platforms with production machinery to increase efficiency by overlapping production time and delivery time. We present a model of mobile workstations and their jobs and describe the task planning algorithm for a team of mobile workstations. The temporal planning problem for mobile workstations combines both features of job shop scheduling problems (JSP) and traveling salesman problem (TSP), but there is little work in the literature that tackles both JSP and TSP simultaneously. Our first algorithm is a complete search algorithm which returns an optimal temporal plan with minimum makespan, and our second algorithm conducts a local search in the space of task graphs so as to quickly return suboptimal temporal plans. According to our experiments, when the number of jobs is small, our second algorithm can generate near-optimal temporal plans, and when the number of jobs is large, our algorithm can generate much shorter plans than SGPlan 5 and a version of job shop scheduling algorithms.",60103153,Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,Ulsan,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",29.285714285714285,0.08923992673992674,0.32783882783882784,1

1771,1771,Semi-Autonomous Interventional Manipulation using Pneumatically Attachable Flexible Rails,"During laparoscopic surgery, tissues frequently need to be retracted and mobilized for manipulation or visualisation. State-of-the-art robotic platforms for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) typically rely on rigid tools to interact with soft tissues. Such tools offer a very narrow contact surface thus applying relatively large forces that can lead to tissue damage, posing a risk for the success of the procedure and ultimately for the patient. In this paper, we show how the use of Pneumatically Attachable Flexible (PAF) rail, a vacuum-based soft attachment for laparoscopic applications, can reduce such risk by offering a larger contact surface between the tool and the tissue. Ex vivo experiments are presented investigating the short- and long-term effects of different levels of vacuum pressure on the tissues surface. These experiments aim at evaluating the best trade-off between applied pressure, potential damage, task duration and connection stability. A hybrid control system has been developed to perform and investigate the organ repositioning task using the proposed system. The task is only partially automated allowing the surgeon to be part of the control loop. A gradient-based planning algorithm is integrated with learning from teleoperation algorithm which allows the robot to improve the learned trajectory. The use of Similar Smooth Path Repositioning (SSPR) algorithm is proposed to improve a demonstrated trajectory based on a known cost function. The results obtained show that a smoother trajectory allows to decrease the minimum level of pressure needed to guarantee active suction during PAF positioning and placement.",60022148,UCL,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.272727272727273,0.06024801587301587,0.46035714285714285,1

In order to overcome these drawbacks, we present in this work, using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to directly estimate the required control signal from an image, encompassing feature extraction and control law computation into one single end-to-end framework. In particular, we study the task of autonomous corridor following using a CNN and present clear advantages in cases where a traditional method used for performing the same task fails to give a reliable outcome.

1774,1774,Effect of Planning Period on MPC-based Navigation for a Biped Robot in a Crowd,"We control a biped robot moving in a crowd with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that generates stable walking motions, with automatic footstep placement. Most walking strategies propose to re-plan the walking motion to adapt to changing environments only once at every footstep. This is because a footstep is planted on the ground, it usually stays there at a constant position until the next footstep is initiated, what naturally constrains the capacity for the robot to react and adapt its motion in between footsteps. The objective of this paper is to measure if re-planning the walking motion more often than once at every footstep can lead to an improvement in collision avoidance when navigating in a crowd. Our result is that re-planning twice (or more) during each footstep leads to a significant reduction of the number of collisions when walking in a crowd, but depends on the density of the crowd.",60104653,Universite Grenoble Alpes,Saint Martin d'Heres,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",30.4,0.17250000000000001,0.4458333333333334,1

However, the PM's nonlinear, time-varying and hysteresis characteristics, and the coupling interference from parallel structure, as well as the unpredicted disturbance caused by arbitrary human behavior all raise difficulties in achieving high-precision control of the robot. In this paper, a multi-input-multi-output disturbance compensated sliding mode controller (MIMO-DCSMC) is proposed to tackle these problems. The proposed control method can tackle the un-modeled uncertainties and the coupling interference existed in multiple PMs' synchronous movement, even with the subject's participation. Experiment results on a healthy subject confirmed that the PMs-actuated ankle rehabilitation robot controlled by the proposed MIMO-DCSMC is able to assist patients to perform high-accuracy rehabilitation tasks by tracking the desired trajectory in a compliant manner.",60022414,Wuhan University of Technology,Wuhan,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",31.4,0.05904761904761905,0.38440476190476197,1

Specifically, in order to achieve real-time operation, existing approaches often assume previously-estimated states to be perfectly known, which leads to inconsistent estimates. Instead, based on the idea of the Schmidt-Kalman filter, which has processing cost linear in the size of the state vector but quadratic memory requirements, we derive a new consistent approximate method in the information domain, which has linear memory requirements and adjustable (constant to linear) processing cost. In particular, this method, the resource-aware inverse Schmidt estimator (RISE), allows trading estimation accuracy for computational efficiency. Furthermore, and in order to better address the requirements of a SLAM system during an exploration vs. a relocalization phase, we employ different configurations of RISE (in terms of the number and order of states updated) to maximize accuracy while preserving efficiency. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed RISE-SLAM algorithm on publicly-available datasets and demonstrate its superiority, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency, as compared to alternative visual-inertial SLAM systems.",60029445,University of Minnesota,Minneapolis,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.285714285714285,0.16530303030303028,0.41378787878787876,1
1777,1777,Geometric and Physical Constraints for Drone-Based Head Plane Crowd Density Estimation,"State-of-the-art methods for counting people in crowded scenes rely on deep networks to estimate crowd density in the image plane. While useful for this purpose, this image-plane density has no immediate physical meaning because it is subject to perspective distortion. This is a concern in sequences acquired by drones because the viewpoint changes often. This distortion is usually handled implicitly by either learning scale-invariant features or estimating density in patches of different sizes, neither of which accounts for the fact that scale changes must be consistent over the whole scene.In this paper, we explicitly model the scale changes and reason in terms of people per square-meter. We show that feeding the perspective model to the network allows us to enforce global scale consistency and that this model can be obtained on the fly from the drone sensors. In addition, it also enables us to enforce physically-inspired temporal consistency constraints that do not have to be learned. This yields an algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring crowd density from a moving drone camera especially when perspective effects are strong.",60028186,Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne,Lausanne,Switzerland,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.571428571428573,0.13055555555555556,0.4174603174603175,1

Consequently the orbital observations must be validated with in situ measurements from a spectrometer on the ground. In planetary exploration this means that a rover must visit selected locations that jointly improve a model of the environment and satisfy mobility and sampling constraints. Conventional planning methods used in this situation follow sub-optimal greedy strategies that are not scalable to large areas.

One critical part of a multi-robot system is its communication system. Depending on the application scenario, high-bandwidth wireless connections, such as WiFi, may not always be available and suffer from a limited communication range. On the other hand, low-bandwith systems require the application itself to deal with limited information exchange. In this work, we present a novel approach for collaborative mapping using mixtures of occupancy and NDT maps (called ONDT), which provide detailed information at low resolutions and in which the pose uncertainty can be encoded efficiently.

During the local DSM generation, a local digital elevation model (DEM) is estimated by projecting the filtered 2D Delaunay mesh to a 3D mesh, and a local orthomosaic is obtained by projecting triangle image patches onto a 2D mesh. During the DSM fusion, both the local DEM and orthomosaic are split into tiles and fused to the global tiled DEM and orthomosaic respectively with multiband algorithm. Both the efficient DSM generation and fusion algorithms contribute to achieving a real-time reconstruction.

Conventional parallel grippers with linear guide mechanisms have been widely utilized as end effectors of robots, especially in industrial fields, because of its simple mechanism and low cost nature. However, the width of the gripper is larger than the stroke due to the mechanical structure of its linear guide mechanism. When objects with various dimensions need to be grasped by a gripper, the width of the gripper is determined by the largest distance between fingers necessary for grasping all of the objects. This makes the collision avoidance of robot difficult even when handling a small object compared to the width of the gripper. The novel compact gripper proposed in this article has three features: long finger stroke with compact dimensions, fingers' parallel motion along a single linear trajectory, and driven by a single actuator. The finger backlash and the gripping force of the proposed mechanism are analyzed, and the parallel gripper with the mechanism is designed based on the analyses. A prototype gripper with minimum width 64 mm, whose maximum fingers stroke is 121 mm, is developed, and experimental results illustrate the performance of the developed gripper.",60008435,Tohoku University,Sendai,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.0,-0.02655279503105591,0.4094720496894411,1

1786,1786,Simultaneous Transparent and Non-Transparent Object Segmentation with Multispectral Scenes,"For an autonomous mobile system such as an autonomous robot that moves throughout a city, semantic segmentation is important. Performing semantic segmentation under diverse conditions, in turn, requires 1) a robust ability to recognize objects in low-visibility environments, such as at night and 2) the ability to recognize objects that transmit visible light, such as glass and acrylic used in doors and windows. To satisfy these requirements, using RGB images and infrared images simultaneously is considered effective. Visibility and infrared transmission characteristics are different for different objects; therefore, merely entering them into the conventional semantic segmentation framework is not applicable. For example, when a pedestrian is present behind a glass, the visible image captures the pedestrian rather than the glass and the infrared image captures the glass. In this research, we propose a new semantic segmentation method having a three-stream structure, focusing on the difference in the transmission characteristics. This method extracts not only valid features for ordinary non-transparent objects but also features effective for the recognition of transparent objects by utilizing differences in objects to be imaged owing to transmission characteristics. Furthermore, we constructed a new dataset called 'coaxials' for the visible and infrared coaxial dataset and demonstrated that we can obtain better segmentation performance compared with the conventional method.",60025272,University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.375,0.10176252319109463,0.5820655534941249,1

In this paper, we propose semi-supervised anomaly detection considering the imbalance of normal situations: In particular, driving data consists of multiple normal situations (e.g., right turn, going straight), some of which (e.g., U-turn) could be as rare as anomalous ones. Existing machine learning based anomaly detection approaches do not fare sufficiently well when applied to such imbalanced data.

1788,1788,"Learning State-Dependent, Sensor Measurement Models for Localization","A robot typically relies on sensor measurements to infer its state and the state of its environment. Unfortunately, sensor measurements are noisy, and the amount of noise can vary with state. The literature provides a collection of methods that estimate and adapt measurement noise over time. However, many methods do not assume that measurement noise is stochastic, or they do not estimate sensor measurement bias and noise based on state. In this paper, we propose a novel method called state-dependent, sensor measurement models(SDSMMs). This method: 1) learns to estimate measurement probability density functions directly from sensor measurements and 2) stochastically estimates an expected measurement (which includes measurement bias) and a measurement noise, both of which are conditioned upon the states of a robot and its environment. Throughout this paper, we discuss how to learn an SDSMM and use it with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We then apply our method to solve an EKF localization problem using a real robot dataset. Our localization results showed that at least one of our proposed methods outperformed a standard EKF in all 15 cases for 2D position error and 10 of 15 cases for 1D orientation error.

1790,1790,3D Micromanipulation of Particle Swarm Using a Hexapole Magnetic Tweezer,"This article discusses the design, modeling, and application of a powerful hexapole magnetic tweezer system for closed-loop 3D swarm control applications. The system consists of six sharp tapered magnetic poles that are integrated with six electromagnetic coils and mounted on two yokes composed of 3D printed magnetic material. Magnetic field gradients are generated at the sharp tips of the magnetic poles when current is applied through the attached electromagnetic coils. Different combinations of current input can interact with magnetized microparticles to create three-dimensional motion. A closed-loop control algorithm based on image processing and hardware integration through MATLAB was developed to automatically operate external power supplies connected to the magnetic tweezer system. Coordinate system transformation is utilized to transform the tilted actuation coordinates, by virtue of the system hardware configuration, to the measurement coordinates used during experiments and analysis. This magnetic tweezer system has the advantage of a larger working space and higher magnetic field strengths when compared to several other similar designs. The magnetic tweezer system allows for more diverse applications within the microscale, such as microparticle swarm control, cell penetration, and cell therapy.

However, current catheter systems provide limited information about the shape of the catheter and tissue-instrument interaction forces during an intervention. Furthermore, relying on inconsistent feedback of such interaction forces during an intervention may result in tissue injury. This paper presents the first steps to estimate the interaction forces between a catheter and a mock-up arterial environment. We base the proposed method on a Pseudo-Rigid Body approximation of the catheter and integrate three-dimensional shape information provided by Fiber Bragg Grating sensors inside the catheter. The reconstructed forces along the catheter body can be fed back to the surgeon in visual and/or haptic form. In this work, the estimated forces are displayed in real-time in a graphical user interface with the reconstructed catheter shape.

The critical adhesion force exerted from the implemented Vortex Actuator (VA) and the VCR's achievable payload are analyzed under 3-DOF rotations of the test surface, while extracted from both geometrical analysis and dynamically-simulated numerical results. A model-based control scheme is later proposed, with the goal of achieving adhesion while the VCR remains immobilized, limiting the power consumption and compensating for disturbances (e.g. moving cables) leading to Center-of-Mass (CoM) changes. Finally, the model-based control scheme is experimentally evaluated, with the VCR prototype on a rotating and moving flat surface.

In this paper we propose a method that allows industrial manipulators to safely operate around humans. This approach guarantees that the manipulator will never collide with human operators while performing its normal tasks. This is done in an near-optimal way by considering how forward reachable sets of human operators grow with time, and by continuously updating these reachable sets based on current position estimates of the operators near the robot. An implicit active set invariance filter is then used to constrain the system - in a minimally invasive way - to stay in the complement of that forward reachable set.

To inform more effective approaches to robotic gait therapy, it is important to understand neuro-mechanical dynamics and control of unimpaired locomotion. Our previous studies reported that human gait entrained to periodic mechanical perturbations at the ankle when the perturbation period was close to preferred walking cadence. Moreover, entrainment was accompanied by synchronizing the perturbations to a constant gait phase, the same for all subjects, where they provided mechanical assistance. To test the generality of entrainment-based assistance, the present study evaluated the behavior of five unimpaired subjects who walked overground while wearing a hip exoskeleton robot. Periodic torque pulses were applied to the subjects' hips, with a period different from, but close to, their preferred stride cadence. Results indicated that unimpaired subjects entrained their gait to periodic mechanical perturbations at the hip. Convergence of relative phase between gait and perturbations was observed, but clustered around two distinct gait phases, in contrast to the single converged phase observed in entrainment to periodic ankle torques. These entrainment studies quantify important aspects of the nonlinear neuro-mechanical dynamics underlying the control of walking, which will inform the development of effective approaches to robotic walking therapy.",60022195,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.333333333333332,0.17566137566137563,0.4077380952380952,1

A reliable method is proposed in this paper to track algal blooms using a set of autonomous surface robots. A satellite image indicates the existence and initial location of the algal bloom for the deployment of the robot system. The algal bloom area is approximated by a circle with time varying location and size. This circle is estimated and circumnavigated by the robots which are able to locally sense its boundary. A multi-agent control algorithm is proposed for the continuous monitoring of the dynamic evolution of the algal bloom. Such algorithm comprises of a decentralised least squares estimation of the target and a controller for circumnavigation. We prove the convergence of the robots to the circle and in equally spaced positions around it.

We design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Hand-held Object Pose and Shape estimation called HOPS-Net and utilize prior work to estimate the hand pose and configuration. We leverage the insight that information about the hand facilitates object pose and shape estimation by incorporating the hand into both training and inference of the object pose and shape as well as the refinement of the estimated pose. The network is trained on a large synthetic dataset of objects in interaction with a human hand. To bridge the gap between real and synthetic images, we employ an image-to-image translation model (Augmented CycleGAN) that generates realistically textured objects given a synthetic rendering. This provides a scalable way of generating annotated data for training HOPS-Net. Our quantitative experiments show that even noisy hand parameters significantly help object pose and shape estimation. The qualitative experiments show results of pose and shape estimation of objects held by a hand 'in the wild'.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.875,0.1270408163265306,0.30051020408163265,1

As smartphones become an important part of our everyday life, they are ever more employed in human activities recognition (HAR) including the monitoring of personal health care and wellbeing. However, HAR is complex and it is important to use the best technology and learn about human activity using machine learning.

To meet the safety requirements and manage difficult use cases (i.e. poor quality or absence of road- marking, traffic jams, severe weather conditions, etc.) without depending on cartography and lane markings, we propose a lidar-based Virtual Lanes (VL) generation system to provide a comfortable and safe ride. For this purpose, hybrid fusion based on Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) coupled with a particle filter is introduced. Two VL strategies are merged: the first constructs virtual lanes based on independent road-borders detection, while the second uses moving objects trajectories. A novel lane similarity computation is also adopted in order to estimate an effective lane comparison. The performance is reported through extensive experiments with Valeo demo-car on highway and beltway roads.

First of all, we show that a distance metric for a tetrahedron deforming between two configurations can be found in closed form based on object norm. Then, we show that the PDd between an intersecting pair of static and deforming tetrahedra can be found by solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem in terms of the distance metric with non-penetration constraints. We also show that the PDd between two, intersected, deforming tetrahedra can be found by solving a similar QP problem under some assumption on penetrating directions, and it can be also accelerated by an order of magnitude using pre-calculated penetration direction. We have implemented our algorithm on a standard PC platform using an off-the-shelf QP optimizer, and experimentally show that both the static/deformable and deformable/deformable tetrahedra cases can be solvable in from a few to tens of milliseconds.

1804,1804,Scaling Robot Supervision to Hundreds of Hours with RoboTurk: Robotic Manipulation Dataset through Human Reasoning and Dexterity,"Large, richly annotated datasets have accelerated progress in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, but replicating these successes in robotics has been challenging. While prior data collection methodologies such as self-supervision have resulted in large datasets, the data can have poor signal-to-noise ratio. By contrast, previous efforts to collect task demonstrations with humans provide better quality data, but they cannot reach the same data magnitude. Furthermore, neither approach places guarantees on the diversity of the data collected, in terms of solution strategies. In this work, we leverage and extend the RoboTurk platform to scale up data collection for robotic manipulation using remote teleoperation. The primary motivation for our platform is two-fold: (1) to address the shortcomings of prior work and increase the total quantity of manipulation data collected through human supervision by an order of magnitude without sacrificing the quality of the data and (2) to collect data on challenging manipulation tasks across several operators and observe a diverse set of emergent behaviors and solutions. We collected over 111 hours of robot manipulation data across 54 users and 3 challenging manipulation tasks in 1 week, resulting in the largest robot dataset collected via remote teleoperation.

The proposed method uses an additional camera to accurately estimate and optimize the scale of the monocular visual odometry, rather than triangulating 3D points from stereo matching. Specifically, the 3D points generated by the monocular visual odometry are projected onto the other camera of the stereo pair, and the scale is recovered and optimized by directly minimizing the photometric error. It is computationally efficient, adding minimal overhead to the stereo vision system compared to straightforward stereo matching, and is robust to repetitive texture. Additionally, direct scale optimization enables stereo visual odometry to be purely based on the direct method.

This is important as self-driving cars need to operate in large environments. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem in a Bayesian filtering framework, and exploit lanes, traffic signs, as well as vehicle dynamics to localize robustly with respect to a sparse semantic map. We validate the effectiveness of our method on a new highway dataset consisting of 312km of roads.

Although methods using markers or machine learning have been developed, general-purpose and highly accurate estimations have not been realized. Our team developed a high-accuracy visual marker 'LentiMark' for high-accuracy estimations of position and posture, but data are lost when the camera cannot obtain marker images. We therefore developed the Marker-IMU system for integrating visual markers with an inertia measurement unit (IMU). When cameras cannot acquire the image of a visual marker, any missing data are restored from IMU data. However, when calculating positions from acceleration sensor values, sensor error increases estimation error. Therefore, we developed a method for error correction using measurements from before and after the missing data.

The approach also enables continuous learning of improved exploration strategies as novel tasks are learned. Extensive simulations on a robot manipulator performing a variety of motion and contact interaction tasks demonstrate the capabilities of the approach. In particular, our experiments suggest that the exploration strategy can more than double learning speed, especially when rewards are sparse. Moreover, the algorithm is robust to task variations and parameter tuning, making it beneficial for complex robotic problems.",60108318,NYU Tandon School of Engineering,New York,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.125,0.03241046831955924,0.42134297520661157,1
1817,1817,IVOA: Introspective Vision for Obstacle Avoidance,"Vision, as an inexpensive yet information rich sensor, is commonly used for perception on autonomous mobile robots. Unfortunately, accurate vision-based perception requires a number of assumptions about the environment to hold - some examples of such assumptions, depending on the perception algorithm at hand, include purely lambertian surfaces, texture-rich scenes, absence of aliasing features, and refractive surfaces. In this paper, we present an approach for introspective vision for obstacle avoidance (IVOA) - by leveraging a supervisory sensor that is occasionally available, we detect failures of stereo vision-based perception from divergence in plans generated by vision and the supervisory sensor. By projecting the 3D coordinates where the plans agree and disagree onto the images used for vision-based perception, IVOA generates a training set of reliable and unreliable image patches for perception. We then use this training dataset to learn a model of which image patches are likely to cause failures of the vision-based perception algorithm. Using this model, IVOA is then able to predict whether the relevant image patches in the observed images are likely to cause failures due to vision (both false positives and false negatives). We empirically demonstrate with extensive real-world data from both indoor and outdoor environments, the ability of IVOA to accurately predict the failures of two distinct vision algorithms.",60014313,University of Massachusetts Amherst,Amherst MA,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",30.428571428571427,0.11258928571428573,0.5225000000000001,1

First, to cope with the standing-up problem with multiple contacts in hierarchical tasks, an enhanced operational-space based whole-body control (WBC) framework is proposed, which offers optimal torque resolutions guaranteeing strict dynamic consistency with inequality constraints formulated by quadratic programming. Second, agile standing-up control strategy with dynamic push and rise actions is newly developed based on the notion of the total energy. The optimal pushing wrenches at contacts are computed to obtain sufficient energy to accelerate the center-of-mass (CoM) of the robot as quick as possible, and the total energy is then controlled to attain rapid rise-up motion and to stabilize the body of the robot. Consequently, the robot can effectively and actively stand up to recover from a certain pose in which cannot be accomplished by any quasi-static motion. The proposed method is numerically experimented and validated with dynamic parameters from the real humanoid COMAN+, fulfilling different types of standing-up actions.",60102151,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia,Genoa,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.666666666666668,0.1363945578231293,0.436734693877551,1
1823,1823,Haptic Guidance for Robot-Assisted Endovascular Procedures: Implementation and Evaluation on Surgical Simulator,"Vascular diseases are the most common precursors to ischemic heart disease and stroke, which are two of the leading causes of death worldwide. Endovascular intervention is a minimally invasive surgical approach to treat such diseases. Compared to open surgery, it has the advantages of faster recovery, reduced need for general anesthesia, reduced blood loss and significantly lower mortality. Endovascular procedures require high surgical skills to minimize contacts between the manipulated instruments (catheters and guidewires) and the vessel wall, which represent one of the major risks for the patient. Robotic assistance can potentially improve the precision and stability of instruments manipulation. One key limitation of current commercial robotic platforms is the lack of haptic feedback, preventing their acceptance and limiting the clinical usability. This paper proposes to bring the benefit of haptic feedback to robot-assisted endovascular intervention. Here we hypothesize that the introduction of 3D haptic guidance during robot-assisted endovascular procedure can further improve the surgical performance and safety while overcoming the limitations of currently available technology. The proposed 3D haptic guidance allows the surgeon to sense the vasculature while controlling a catheter through a robotic haptic manipulator. Validation of the system is performed through end-user experiments with vascular surgeons on a bespoke surgical simulator. The obtained results demonstrate that 3D haptic guidance has the potential of improving effectiveness, precision, and safety of endovascular intervention. Furthermore, vascular surgeons found the proposed technology safe and overall easy to use, indicating its potential on real surgical procedures.",60015150,Imperial College London,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.333333333333332,0.08253472222222223,0.5228472222222224,1

In this paper, we present the design and experimental comparison of Model Predictive and PID multirotor position controllers augmented with a disturbance estimator to reject strong wind gusts up to 12 m/s and ground effect. For disturbance estimation, we compare Extended and Unscented Kalman filtering. In extensive in- and outdoor flight tests, we evaluate the suitability of the developed control and estimation algorithms to run on a computationally constrained platform.

The E-CoSMo is a previously developed 4-DoF point-centered rotational parallel mechanism with coaxial actuators. The use of the E-CoSMo on robotic system is expected to improve dynamic performance since all actuators are mounted on fixed base. Furthermore, output torque is amplified in a specific axial direction, due to a coaxial parallel mechanism. Torque analysis of the mechanism is derived based on kinematics of a virtual 4-DoF serial linkages and the E-CoSMo. A virtual force-based position control simulation is performed for verifying the torque analysis. Due to the valid torque analysis, the norm of position error is less than 0. 7mm. It is confirmed that the output torque is amplified compare to actuator torques, which is a special feature of the E-CoSMo.

We show that humans - when faced with this challenge - adopt coordinated finger movements which enable them to successfully grasp objects even from these awkward poses. We also show that it is relatively straight forward to implement these strategies autonomously. Our human-studies approach asks participants to perform grasping task by either 'puppetteering' a robotic manipulator that is identical (geometrically and kinematically) to a popular underactuated robotic manipulator (the Barrett hand), or using sliders to control the original Barrett hand. Unlike previous studies, this enables us to directly capture and compare human manipulation strategies with robotic ones. Our observation is that, while humans employ underactuation, how they use it is fundamentally different (and more effective) than that found in existing hardware.",60013402,Oregon State University,Corvallis,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.833333333333332,0.12061403508771928,0.5345864661654136,1
1830,1830,"Forecasting Time-to-Collision from Monocular Video: Feasibility, Dataset, and Challenges","We explore the possibility of using a single monocular camera to forecast the time to collision between a suitcase-shaped robot being pushed by its user and other nearby pedestrians. We develop a purely image-based deep learning approach that directly estimates the time to collision without the need of relying on explicit geometric depth estimates or velocity information to predict future collisions. While previous work has focused on detecting immediate collision in the context of navigating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, the detection was limited to a binary variable (i.e., collision or no collision). We propose a more fine-grained approach to collision forecasting by predicting the exact time to collision in terms of milliseconds, which is more helpful for collision avoidance in the context of dynamic path planning. To evaluate our method, we have collected a novel dataset of over 13,000 indoor video segments each showing a trajectory of at least one person ending in a close proximity (a near collision) with the camera mounted on a mobile suitcase-shaped platform. Using this dataset, we do extensive experimentation on different temporal windows as input using an exhaustive list of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our results show that our proposed multi-stream CNN is the best model for predicting time to near-collision.

We show that this changed representation of the environment increases the robustness and accuracy in the perception of the scene and simplifies significantly the processing and complexity of the perception module. At the same time, the changed representation allows also a better prioritization of attention to the moving object around the robot that takes into account not the Euclidean distance but the time-to-interaction (TTI), which is the core contribution of this approach.

1833,1833,MRLift: A Semi-active Lower Back Support Exoskeleton based on MR Fluid and Force Retention Technology,"Wearable robots suffer from issues of usability, cost-performance, and battery life. These drawbacks hinder the development of their market and their implementation in healthcare and industry. Back support exoskeletons in particular rely heavily on mechanical storing of energy but are still mostly using traditional mechanical elements and actuators to achieve the task. The core technology of our work, named MRLink, uses a smart fluid in combination with a compression spring to produce a unique energy store-and-release functionality. With only 5 Watts MRLink can produce over 500N of braking force. The braking force, variable viscosity, can be continuously controlled through the supply current. With appropriate selection of the spring and control method, the required assist energy can be acquired from body weight and movement dynamics, stored momentarily and, released at the appropriate timing to assist the body motion. The MRLink does not require an external power source like pneumatic actuators, does not require gearboxes and large batteries like DC motors, and comes in a compact package. Thus, this technology has the potential to significantly contribute to wearable exoskeletons in general, and back support exoskeletons in particular.

To achieve this goal, we propose a control law based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), with an actorcritic structure.

1835,1835,Combined group method of data handling models using artificial bee colony algorithm in time series forecasting," Published by Elsevier B.V.Time series forecasting is an important area of forecasting which has gained many attentions from various research areas. In line with its popularity, various models have been introduced for the purpose of producing accurate time series forecasts. Nevertheless, it is difficult to find an ideal model as there is no model that can perform best for all types of data. Recently, combination of forecasts has gained immense popularity in the time series forecasting area. Among the well-known combination technique is the weighted-based approach, where appropriate weights are given based on the performance of each individual model. In this paper, a robust methodology for accurate time series forecasting based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and four Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) models, namely GMDH-Polynomial, GMDH-Radial Basis Function, GMDH-Sigmoid and GMDH-Tangent are proposed. In this methodology, the first step was to develop forecasts using individual GMDH models. In the second step, weights for each individual GMDH were calculated heuristically using ABC algorithm. In the final step, the results were aggregated to form a new forecast. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of the proposed model, the model was applied to a real time series data which is the monthly tourist arrivals from Singapore to Malaysia from year 2000 to 2017. Based on the empirical results, the application of nonlinear transfer function such as Tangent function has the potential to improve the performance of GMDH model, while the other functions such as Sigmoid function produced a forecast which is worse than the conventional GMDH-Polynomial. However, the combination of GMDH models using ABC managed to outperform all the individual models. The empirical finding demonstrated the efficiency of Combined GMDH model in time series forecasting, as well as the applicability of implementing optimization algorithm to find appropriate weights for the individual models.",60021005,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,Johor Bahru,Malaysia,['1700'],23.384615384615383,0.11307832792207793,0.5292715097402598,0

We leverage this structural regularity to estimate the absolute and relative camera poses. We decouple the rotation and translation, and propose a novel rotation estimation method. We decompose the absolute and relative rotations and reformulate the problem as computing the rotation from the Manhattan frame to the camera frame. To compute this rotation, we propose an accurate and efficient two-step method. We first estimate its two degrees of freedom (DOF) by two image lines, and then estimate its third DOF by another image line. For these lines, we assume their associated 3D lines are mutually orthogonal, or two 3D lines are parallel to each other and orthogonal to the third. Thanks to our two-step DOF estimation, our absolute and relative pose estimation methods are accurate and efficient. Moreover, our relative pose estimation method relies on weaker assumptions or less correspondences than existing approaches. We also propose a novel strategy to reject outliers and identify dominant directions of the scene. We integrate it into our pose estimation methods, and show that it is more robust than RANSAC.

Stimulus selection should be fast to efficiently allocate available (and limited) computational resources to process in detail a subset of the otherwise overwhelmingly large sensory input. The amount of processing required is a product of the amount of data sampled by a robot's sensors; while a standard RGB camera produces a fixed amount of data for every pixel of the sensor, an event-camera produces data only for where there is a contrast change in the field of view, and does so with a lower latency. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a state-of-the-art bottom-up attention model, based on structuring the visual scene in terms of proto-objects. As an event-camera encodes different visual information compared to frame-based cameras, the original algorithm must be adapted and modified. We find that the event-camera's inherent detection of edges removes the need for some early stages of processing in the model.

Due to the uncertain nature of the future, it is desired to make inference from a probability perspective instead of deterministic prediction. In this paper, we propose a conditional generative neural system (CGNS) for probabilistic trajectory prediction to approximate the data distribution, with which realistic, feasible and diverse future trajectory hypotheses can be sampled. The system combines the strengths of conditional latent space learning and variational divergence minimization, and leverages both static context and interaction information with soft attention mechanisms. We also propose a regularization method for incorporating soft constraints into deep neural networks with differentiable barrier functions, which can regulate and push the generated samples into the feasible regions.

The local planner employs a rapidly-exploring random graph to reliably and efficiently identify collision-free paths that optimize an exploration gain within a local subspace. Accounting for the robot endurance limitations and the possibility that the local planner reaches a dead-end (e.g. a mine heading), the global planner is engaged when a return-to-home path must be derived or when the robot should be re-positioned towards an edge of the exploration space. The proposed planner is field evaluated in a collection of deployments inside both active and abandoned underground mines in the U.S. and in Switzerland.",60001769,"University of Nevada, Reno",Reno,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.142857142857142,-0.04814814814814815,0.30000000000000004,1
1842,1842,Deep Predictive Autonomous Driving Using Multi-Agent Joint Trajectory Prediction and Traffic Rules,"Autonomous driving is a challenging problem because the autonomous vehicle must understand complex and dynamic environment. This understanding consists of predicting future behavior of nearby vehicles and recognizing predefined rules. It is observed that not all rules have equivalent values, and the priority of the rules may change depending on the situation or the driver's driving style. In this work, we jointly reason both a future trajectories of vehicles and degree of satisfaction of each rule in the deep learning framework. Joint reasoning allows modeling interactions between vehicles, and leads to better prediction results. A rule is represented as a signal temporal logic (STL) formula, and a robustness slackness, a margin to the satisfaction of the rule, is predicted for the both autonomous and other vehicle, in addition to future trajectories. Learned robustness slackness decides which rule should be prioritized for the given situation for the autonomous vehicle, and filter out non-valid predicted trajectories for surrounding vehicles. The predicted information from the deep learning framework is used in model predictive control (MPC), which allows the autonomous vehicle navigate efficiently and safely. We test the feasibility of our approach in publicly available NGSIM datasets. Proposed method shows a driving style similar to the human one and considers the safety related to the rules through the future prediction of the surrounding vehicles.",60120116,Automation and Systems Research Institute,Seoul,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.0,0.16547619047619047,0.43055555555555564,1
1843,1843,Mobile Robot Localization with Reinforcement Learning Map Update Decision aided by an Absolute Indoor Positioning System,"This paper introduces a new mobile robot localization solution consisting of two main modules: A Particle-Filter based Localization (PFL) and a Reinforcement-Learning based map updating, integrating relative measurements and absolute indoor positioning sensor (A-IPS) data. Concerning localization using 2D-LiDARs, featureless areas are known to be problematic. To solve this problem a classic PFL approach was modified to incorporate A-IPS position measurements in the prediction and update stages. The localization approach has the particularity of including the possibility of updating the map whenever major modifications are detected in the environment in relation to the current localization map. Due to the random sampling-based nature of the PFL, an associated map update solution is not trivial since small inconsistencies in the estimated pose can lead to erroneous map associations. The proposed method learns to decide by assigning higher rewards the greater is the overlap between the map and the 2DLIDAR scans, via RL, and then a proper update of the map is achieved. Validation of the proposed pipeline was carried out in a differential drive platform with algorithms developed in ROS. Tests were performed in two scenarios in order to assess the performance of both the localization module and the map update stage. The results show that the proposed localization method offers improvements in relation to known approaches, and consequently suggest promising perspectives for the proposed map update decision framework.",60106429,"University of Coimbra, Institute of Systems and Robotics",Coimbra,Portugal,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.22222222222222,0.022622053872053866,0.3627525252525252,1

However, the sequential nature of the learning process is usually neglected. In this paper, we propose to use active incremental learning by selecting a task which maximizes performance improvement over entire task set. The proposed framework exploits knowledge of individual tasks accumulated in a database and shares it among the tasks using a contextual skill model. The framework is agnostic to the type of policy representation, skill model, and policy search. We evaluated the skill improvement rate in two tasks, ball-in-a-cup and basketball.

However, it is challenging for at least three reasons: the desired motion of the object might be too complex to be described analytically, precise models of the manipulated objects are not available, the controller should simultaneously ensure both a robust grasp and an effective in-hand motion. To solve these issues we propose to learn in-hand robotic manipulation tasks from human demonstrations, using Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs), and to reproduce them with a robust compliant controller based on the Virtual Springs Framework (VSF), that employs real-time feedback of the contact forces measured on the robot fingertips. With this solution, the generalization capabilities of DMPs can be transferred successfully to the dexterous in-hand manipulation problem: we demonstrate this by presenting real-world experiments of in-hand translation and rotation of unknown objects.",60022109,"Queen Mary, University of London",London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",39.75,0.08333333333333333,0.55,1

Energy efficient airspeed reference compensation logic is developed for excess wind scenarios (i.e. when the wind speed rises above the airspeed), enabling either mitigation, prevention, or over-powering of excess wind induced run-away from a given path. The developed guidance law is demonstrated on a representative small, low-speed test UAV in two flight experiments conducted in mountainous regions of Switzerland with strong, turbulent wind conditions, gusts reaching up to 13 meters per second.

As the sound source localization by drones is uncertain because of the observation significantly distorted by noise such as rotor noise, the belief on the estimated targets may consist of multiple peaks that are spread over the bounded search area. The proposed control policy is formulated with a robust cost function so that the function encodes the search mission properly. A peak management mechanism is additionally introduced to keep tracking all targets by masking sufficiently observed and well estimated targets whose peaks normally become steep and high.

FA-Harris consists of several components, including an event filter, a Global Surface of Active Events (G-SAE) maintaining unit, a corner candidate selecting unit, and a corner candidate refining unit. The proposed G-SAE maintenance algorithm and corner candidate selection algorithm greatly enhance the real-time performance for corner detection, while the corner candidate refinement algorithm maintains the accuracy of performance by using an improved event-based Harris detector. Additionally, FA-Harris does not require artificially synthesized event-frames and can operate on asynchronous events directly.

This paper proposes decentralized and fully reactive controllers for pose control of 3D modular reconfigurable robots. The robots operate in liquid environments, and move by routing fluid through themselves. Each module uses only two bits of sensory information per face. Additionally, the modules can use up to five bits of information that are exchanged via shared power lines. We prove that robots of convex shape are guaranteed to reach a goal object with a preferred orientation. Using computer simulations of Modular Hydraulic Propulsion robots, all controllers are assessed for different environments, system sizes and noise, and their performances compared against a centralized controller.

Most partially observable markov decision process (POMDP) planners address challenges of unknown environments with discrete states, observations and actions, which are fail to automate the operative procedure. However, the BCTS method addresses the issue by handling POMDPs in continuous state, observation and action spaces. The proposed approach has a bidirectional search structure with the intent of greatly improving the calculation efficiency. Meanwhile, Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is considered to dynamically sample promising actions while we construct a belief tree. In view of the speed of BO process, the upper and lower bounds of the optimal action values given by fast informed bound (FIB) and point-based value iteration (PBVI) limit the search scope, so we can improve the speed of BO. In addition, we apply an optimal path planning generator, radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), to obtain a smoother trajectory.

For this purpose, we propose a method to generate nonlinear pushing motions for object singulation based on an off-the-shelf machine learning algorithm and a typical semantic segmentation algorithm. Through experiments, we show that the success rate of robotic grasping is considerably improved by the proposed pushing behavior.

However, to best knowledge of the authors, there is no report on the automation of the time-consuming process: moving the injection tools (a micropipette, a grippers, etc.) and cells into the field of view (FOV) of microscope from the macro FOV(outside the microscopic FOV). This paper presents a novel macro-micro conversion strategy, and a grid detection and positioning algorithm to automate the time-consuming step of moving the injection tools and cells to the microscopic FOV. The proposed solution can free the technician from the laborious hand-eye coordination operations for moving the injection tools and cells to the target position within the microscopic FOV. Furthermore, this paper proposes an auto-focusing algorithm to automate the operation step: moving down the gripper from the air outside the culture media and then precisely clamping a cell in the liquid environment for injection. In the proposed solution, the active window-based auto-focusing algorithm is developed to solve the challenging problem: the image information is lost due to the 'viscous effect' taking place when the gripper jaw touches the water surface. The proposed solutions are tested and validated by the microinjection experiments of zebrafish embryos using the in-house develop micro-robotic system.

A new vision-based impedance controller is proposed for polishing robots to automate the labor-intensive works. The desired impedance model is specified as the control objective to regulate the dynamic relationship between the interaction force and the motion of the robot end effector, where the motion is measured with the vision feedback. The use of the vision feedback guarantees the performance of the robot from two aspect. First, the vision feedback from the high-resolution camera ensures the accuracy of measurement of the robot end effector and hence guarantees the quality of polishing. Second, the concept of image moment is introduced such that the image Jacobian matrix is non-singular in a global sense, which guarantees the large working range of the robot.

1857,1857,Predicting Grasp Success with a Soft Sensing Skin and Shape-Memory Actuated Gripper,"Tactile sensors have been increasingly used to support rigid robot grippers in object grasping and manipulation. However, rigid grippers are often limited in their ability to handle compliant, delicate, or irregularly shaped objects. In recent years, grippers made from soft and flexible materials have become increasingly popular for certain manipulation tasks, e.g., grasping, due to their ability to conform to the object shape without the need for precise control. Although promising, such soft robot grippers currently suffer from the lack of available sensing modalities. In this work, we introduce a soft and stretchable sensing skin and incorporate it into the two fingers of a shape-memory actuated soft gripper. The onboard sensing skin includes a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) and five discrete pressure sensors per finger. We use this sensorized soft gripper to study grasp success and stability of over 2585 grasps with various objects using several machine learning methods. Our experiments show that LSTMs were the most accurate predictors of grasp success and stability, compared to SVMs, FFNNs, and ST-HMP. We also evaluated the effects on performance of each sensor's data, and the success rates for individual objects. The results show that the accelerometer data of the IMUs has the largest contribution to the overall grasp prediction, which we attribute to its ability to detect precise movements of the gripper during grasping.",60104841,The Robotics Institute,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.3,0.154532967032967,0.39702380952380956,1
1858,1858,Efficient Epileptic Seizure Detection Based on the Event Driven Processing," Published by Elsevier B.V.Big number of people all over the world is affected by epilepsy. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a crucial component in the evaluation of epilepsy. Onset seizure detection is essential to prevent the seizure activity and improve patients' life quality. Presurgical treatment, precise assessment, seizure prevention, and emergency alerts all depend on the quick detection of seizure onset. Moreover, manual examination of EEG signals is boring and time-consuming task. Numerous automated epileptic seizure detection schemes have been developed to help neurologists. The aim of this paper is to develop an intelligent event-driven EEG signal acquisition module to achieve an efficient solution for epileptic seizure detection. The suggested method acquires the signal with an event-driven A/D converter (EDADC). The output of EDADC is passed through the activity selection and interpolation blocks. It allows focusing only on the important signal parts and resampling it uniformly. The autoregressive (AR) Burg modelling is employed to extract the features. Afterwards, the extracted features are utilized by C4.5 and NBTree classification techniques. The event-driven feature enables to adapt the system processing load according to the signal temporal variations. This interesting feature of the devised system aptitudes a drastic reduction in its processing activity and therefore in the power consumption as compared to the traditional ones. A comparison of the performance of different classifiers is also made in terms of accuracy.

1859,1859,Continuous Relaxation of Symbolic Planner for One-Shot Imitation Learning,"We address one-shot imitation learning, where the goal is to execute a previously unseen task based on a single demonstration. While there has been exciting progress in this direction, most of the approaches still require a few hundred tasks for meta-training, which limits the scalability of the approaches. Our main contribution is to formulate one-shot imitation learning as a symbolic planning problem along with the symbol grounding problem. This formulation disentangles the policy execution from the inter-task generalization and leads to better data efficiency. The key technical challenge is that the symbol grounding is prone to error with limited training data and leads to subsequent symbolic planning failures. We address this challenge by proposing a continuous relaxation of the discrete symbolic planner that directly plans on the probabilistic outputs of the symbol grounding model. Our continuous relaxation of the planner can still leverage the information contained in the probabilistic symbol grounding and significantly improve over the baseline planner for the one-shot imitation learning tasks without using large training data.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.142857142857142,0.07331932773109243,0.3300420168067227,1
1860,1860,Robust High Accuracy Visual-Inertial-Laser SLAM System,"In recent years, many excellent works on visual-inertial SLAM and laser-based SLAM have been proposed. Although inertial measurement unit (IMU) significantly improve the motion estimate performance by reducing the impact of illumination variation or texture-less region on visual tracking, tracking failures occur when in such an environment for a long time. Similarly, when in structure-less environments, laser module will fail since lack of sufficient geometric features. Besides, motion estimation by moving lidar has the problem of distortion since range measurements are received continuously. To solve these problems, we propose a robust and high-accuracy visual-inertial-laser SLAM system. The system starts with a visual-inertial tightly-coupled method for motion estimation, followed by scan matching to further optimize the estimation and register point cloud on the map. Furthermore, we enable modules to be adjusted automatically and flexibly. That is, when one of these modules fails, the remaining modules will undertake the motion-tracking task. For further improving the accuracy, loop closure and proximity detection are implemented to eliminate drift accumulation. When loop or proximity is detected, we perform six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) pose graph optimization to achieve the global consistency.

1861,1861,FlightGoggles: Photorealistic Sensor Simulation for Perception-driven Robotics using Photogrammetry and Virtual Reality,"FlightGoggles is a photorealistic sensor simulator for perception-driven robotic vehicles. The key contributions of FlightGoggles are twofold. First, FlightGoggles provides photorealistic exteroceptive sensor simulation using graphics assets generated with photogrammetry. Second, it provides the ability to combine (i) synthetic exteroceptive measurements generated in silico in real time and (ii) vehicle dynamics and proprioceptive measurements generated in motio by vehicle(s) in flight in a motion-capture facility. FlightGoggles is capable of simulating a virtual-reality environment around autonomous vehicle(s) in flight. While a vehicle is in flight in the Flight-Goggles virtual reality environment, exteroceptive sensors are rendered synthetically in real time while all complex dynamics are generated organically through natural interactions of the vehicle. The FlightGoggles framework allows for researchers to accelerate development by circumventing the need to estimate complex and hard-to-model interactions such as aerodynamics, motor mechanics, battery electrochemistry, and behavior of other agents. The ability to perform vehicle-in-the-loop experiments with photorealistic exteroceptive sensor simulation facilitates novel research directions involving, e.g., fast and agile autonomous flight in obstacle-rich environments, safe human interaction, and flexible sensor selection. FlightGoggles has been utilized as the main test for selecting nine teams that will advance in the AlphaPilot autonomous drone racing challenge.

However, correct data fusion depends on precise calibration of the rigid body transform between the sensors. In this paper we present the first framework that makes use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for odometry estimation fusing 2D laser scanners and mono-cameras. The use of CNNs provides the tools to not only extract the features from the two sensors, but also to fuse and match them without needing a calibration between the sensors. We transform the odometry estimation into an ordinal classification problem in order to find accurate rotation and translation values between consecutive frames. Results on a real road dataset show that the fusion network runs in real-time and is able to improve the odometry estimation of a single sensor alone by learning how to fuse two different types of data information.",60030506,Mines ParisTech,Paris,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.333333333333332,0.2565476190476191,0.5220238095238096,1

1864,1864,Configuration Modeling of a Soft Robotic Element with Selectable Bending Axes,"This paper presents an approach for modeling new soft robotic materials which possess the ability to control directional stiffness. These materials are inspired by biological systems where movements are enabled by variable stiffness tissue and contraction of localized muscle groups. Here a low-melting-point (LMP) material lattice embedded in an elastomer serves as a rigid skeleton that may be locally melted to allow bending at selectable joint locations. The forward kinematics of the lattice has been modeled using the product of exponentials method with the incorporation of bending axis selectivity.

This class of systems include gymnastic robots and the classic cart-pole system. For this class of systems, we can define a connection point, and design a damping controller u(t) with the Lyapunov method to drive all states to the connection point. Further by exploiting the time reversal symmetry of the system and spline interpolation, a controller u(-t) can be obtained to drive the system from the connection point to any other state. The system is thus shown completely controllable, i.e., there exists an admissible trajectory from any given state to any given final state.

The system allows for online editing of a map produced by a robot running SLAM. Through hand gestures, the user can edit, in real time, the robot map that is augmented on top of the physical environment. Moreover, the proposed system leverages the built-in SLAM capabilities of the AR-HMD to correct the robot's map and map areas that are not yet discovered by the robot. Our method aims to combine the unique and complementary capabilities of each of the three different agents to produce the maximum possible mapping accuracy in the minimum amount of time.

We focus on processes which can be represented by a Gaussian random variable, which is known to reduce the general stochastic information acquisition problem to a deterministic problem, which is much simpler to solve. Previous work on solving the resulting deterministic problem focuses on computing a search tree by Forward Value Iteration and pruning uninformative nodes early on in the search via a domination criteria. In this work we formulate the Active Information Acquisition problem as a deterministic planning problem where algorithms like Dijkstra and mathrm{A} can produce optimal solutions. To use mathrm{A}- effectively in long planning horizons we derive a consistent and admissible heuristic as a function of the sensor model which can be used in information acquisition tasks such as actively mapping static and moving targets in an environment with obstacles.

Localization of the optic disc will help in diabolizing several vision-threatening eye diseases. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature but are complicated in terms of computations and lack accuracy in face of brightness changes. In order to boost the accuracy of optical disc detection, a combination of vessel convergence and elliptical symmetry clues is proposed. The elliptical symmetry constraint has been found to correctly capture the shape of the disc, which is further strengthen by combining it with the vessel convergence measure as most of the vessels converge inside the disc.

Unlike previous works which plan dynamical feasible trajectories using motion primitives and track the generated trajectory by a geometric controller, our proposed method is an end-to-end approach which takes the flight scenario as input and directly outputs thrust-attitude control commands for the quadrotor. Key contributions of our paper are: 1) presenting an imitate-reinforce training framework. 2) flying through a narrow gap using an end-to-end policy network, showing that learning based method can also address the highly dynamic control problem as the traditional pipeline does (see attached video1). 3) propose a robust imitation of an optimal trajectory generator using multilayer perceptrons. 4) show how reinforcement learning can improve the performance of imitation learning, and the potential to achieve higher performance over the model-based method.",60008592,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.142857142857142,0.022619047619047625,0.5130952380952382,1

The segment is closed in the circumferential direction and open in the meridional direction. The open edges are assumed to be simply supported. The segment therefore roughly resembles the geometry of a rotating tyre. The energy approach is used assuming shell displacements in the form of Fourier series in both circumferential and meridional directions. In the circumferential direction only one term of the Fourier series is necessary to describe exactly each vibration mode. In the meridional direction a relatively small number of Fourier series terms is necessary to achieve convergence. Tensional forces induced by the pressure and centrifugal loads are also determined by the energy approach. The application of the proposed procedure is illustrated by a numerical example. The increase in the internal pressure increases values of natural frequencies, whereas the shell rotation causes their bifurcation and the occurrence of travelling modes. In order to validate the method, the obtained results are compared with those determined by the finite strip method and by the finite element method.",60087200,"University of Zagreb, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture",Zagreb,Croatia,"['1712', '1706']",16.909090909090907,0.0,0.47602040816326535,0

DMPs is a modified formulation of virtual spring-dampers (VSD) system that enjoys better fitting performance in learning. Further, while dealing with the trajectory tracking problem of mobile robots, a novel nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) approach is proposed for motion control.

In this paper, we propose a multi-task convolutional neural network for autonomous robotic grasping, which can help the robot find the target, make the plan for grasping and finally grasp the target step by step in object stacking scenes. We integrate vision-based robotic grasping detection and visual manipulation relationship reasoning in one single deep network and build the autonomous robotic grasping system.

In this regard, deep convolution neural networks have shown to be effective on processing different facial representations but with a high cost: to achieve maximum generalization, they require an enormous amount of task-specific labeled data. This paper proposes a unified semi-supervised deep neural model to address this problem. Our hybrid model is composed of an unsupervised deep generative adversarial network which learns fundamental characteristics of facial representations, and a set of convolution channels that fine-tunes the high-level facial concepts for the recognition of identity, age group, gender, and facial expressions. Our network employs progressive lateral connections between the convolution channels so that they share the high-abstraction particularities of each of these tasks in order to reduce the necessity of a large amount of strongly labeled training data. We propose a series of experiments to evaluate each individual mechanism of our hybrid model, in particular, the impact of the progressive connections on learning the specific facial recognition tasks and we observe that our model achieves a better performance when compared to task-specific models.",60028229,Universität Hamburg,Hamburg,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",29.571428571428573,0.1075776397515528,0.3700103519668738,1

Much prior work on applying RL to manipulation tasks has defined the action space in terms of direct joint torques or reference positions for a joint-space proportional derivative (PD) controller. In practice, it is often possible to add additional structure by taking advantage of model-based controllers that support both accurate positioning and control of the dynamic response of the manipulator. In this paper, we evaluate how the choice of action space for dynamic manipulation tasks affects the sample complexity as well as the final quality of learned policies. We compare learning performance across three tasks (peg insertion, hammering, and pushing), four action spaces (torque, joint PD, inverse dynamics, and impedance control), and using two modern reinforcement learning algorithms (Proximal Policy optimization and Soft Actor-Critic).

Pest attack is among the main threat that reducing the quality and quantity of the paddy crops. Pesticide is used to control and eliminate the pest in paddy field. In order to determine the quantity of pesticide used, traditional method is based on manual counting where sticky trap is used to trap the pest and after that the pest was counted manually. However, this method is tedious and time consuming due to many crops generally found in paddy field. This can lead to imprecise counting through the process and delay in order to gain the accurate count. This paper proposed an image processing technique and artificial intelligent as an alternate method for identification and counting of pests. The suggested pest detection consists of four (4) consecutive steps; image acquisition, image segmentation, feature extraction and detection. The detection step contains two processes that are classification and counting of pest. A k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classifier is used in this step. The process is developed and implemented using MATLAB. Simulation results using 10 pest images indicated that the classification performance of brown planthopper using kNN provides better performance compared to decision tree.

1891,1891,Complex Stiffness Model of Physical Human-Robot Interaction: Implications for Control of Performance Augmentation Exoskeletons,"Human joint dynamic stiffness plays an important role in the stability of performance augmentation exoskeletons. In this paper, we consider a new frequency domain model of the human joint dynamics which features a complex value stiffness. This complex stiffness consists of a real stiffness and a hysteretic damping. We use it to explain the dynamic behaviors of the human connected to the exoskeleton, in particular the observed non-zero low frequency phase shift and the near constant damping ratio of the resonance as stiffness and inertia vary. We validate this concept with an elbow-joint exoskeleton testbed (attached to a subject) by experimentally varying joint stiffness behavior, exoskeleton inertia, and the strength augmentation gain. We compare three different models of elbow-joint dynamic stiffness: A model with real stiffness, viscous damping and inertia; a model with complex stiffness and inertia; and a model combining the previous two models. Our results show that the hysteretic damping term improves modeling accuracy (via a statistical F-test). Moreover, this term contributes more to model accuracy than the viscous damping term. In addition, we experimentally observe a linear relationship between the hysteretic damping and the real part of the stiffness which allows us to simplify the complex stiffness model down to a 1-parameter system. Ultimately, we design a fractional order controller to demonstrate how human hysteretic damping behavior can be exploited to improve strength amplification performance while maintaining stability.",60013372,The University of Texas at Austin,Austin,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.1,0.014790764790764787,0.35393217893217893,1

However, safely controlling a drone while filming a moving target usually requires multiple expert human operators; hence the need for an autonomous cinematographer. Current approaches have severe real-life limitations such as requiring fully scripted scenes, high-precision motion-capture systems or GPS tags to localize targets, and prior maps of the environment to avoid obstacles and plan for occlusion.In this work, we overcome such limitations and propose a complete system for aerial cinematography that combines: (1) a vision-based algorithm for target localization; (2) a real-time incremental 3D signed-distance map algorithm for occlusion and safety computation; and (3) a real-time camera motion planner that optimizes smoothness, collisions, occlusions and artistic guidelines. We evaluate robustness and real-time performance in series of field experiments and simulations by tracking dynamic targets moving through unknown, unstructured environments. Finally, we verify that despite removing previous limitations, our system achieves state-of-the-art performance.",60104841,The Robotics Institute,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",33.8,0.007287157287157282,0.40238095238095245,1

While dense 3D point-cloud-based maps enable precise localization, they impose significant storage and transmission burdens when used in city-scale environments. In this paper, we propose a highly compressed representation for LiDAR maps, along with an efficient and robust real-time alignment algorithm for on-vehicle LiDAR scans. The proposed mapping framework, which we refer to as Feature Likelihood Acquisition Map Emulation (FLAME), requires less than 0.1% of the storage space of the original 3D point cloud map. In essence, FLAME emulates an original map through feature likelihood functions. In particular, FLAME models planar, pole and curb features. These three feature classes are long-term stable, distinct and common among vehicular roadways. Multiclass feature points are extracted from LiDAR scans through feature detection. A new multiclass-based point-to-distribution alignment method is proposed to find the association and alignment between the multiclass feature points and the FLAME map. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve the same level of accuracy (less than 10cm) as the 3D point cloud based localization.",60031707,Michigan State University,East Lansing,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",18.2,0.17968805704099824,0.5055614973262031,1
1896,1896,Partial Caging: A Clearance-Based Definition and Deep Learning,"Caging grasps limit the mobility of an object to a bounded component of configuration space. We introduce a notion of partial cage quality based on maximal clearance of an escaping path. As this is a computationally demanding task even in a two-dimensional scenario, we propose a deep learning approach. We design two convolutional neural networks and construct a pipeline for real-time partial cage quality estimation directly from 2D images of object models and planar caging tools. One neural network, CageMaskNN, is used to identify caging tool locations that can support partial cages, while a second network that we call CageClearanceNN is trained to predict the quality of those configurations. A dataset of 3811 images of objects and more than 19 million caging tool configurations is used to train and evaluate these networks on previously unseen objects and caging tool configurations. Furthermore, the networks are trained jointly on configurations for both 3 and 4 caging tool configurations whose shape varies along a 1-parameter family of increasing elongation. In experiments, we study how the networks' performance depends on the size of the training dataset, as well as how to efficiently deal with unevenly distributed training data. In further analysis, we show that the evaluation pipeline can approximately identify connected regions of successful caging tool placements and we evaluate the continuity of the cage quality score evaluation along caging tool trajectories.

1898,1898,CNN-Based Crowd Counting Through IoT: Application for Saudi Public Places," Published by Elsevier B.V.Crowd counting in specific places has recently been considered as a significant contribution in many applications in terms of security and economic values. Recently, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has considered new ways and methods to diversify sources of income, where many non-traditional establishments in several fields have been initiated and put in place. However, controlling the number of visitors and participants to events and exhibitions has always been a challenge, as it has always been considered as an important success factor to any event. Smart public places approach is one of the inevitable directions of development in Saudi Arabia, where security, comfort, and safety of crowds is to be controlled and managed using machine learning techniques, more specifically, IoT-based crowd counting techniques. Such a technology will not only help in resolving security and safety problems, but also will play a significant role in reducing waiting time for visitors, by giving indicators, projections and advices on crowded places. In this paper, a mobile-based model is proposed for counting people in high and low crowded public places in Saudi Arabia under various scene conditions with no prior knowledge. The proposed model is built based on pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) called VGG-16 with some modifications on the last layer of the CNN to increase the efficiency of the training model. In addition to the improvement of efficiency, the proposed method accepts images of arbitrary sizes/scales as inputs. The applicability of the proposed method has been evaluated by incorporating IoT architecture, where surveillance cameras to be connected to the Internet to capture live pictures of different public places. To achieve this goal, New and special Saudi people dataset as well as some other existing dataset, have been produced and used to train the network.

The robot, consisting of two airfoils and two horizontally directed motor-driven propellers, revolves around its vertical axis to hover. To amplify the thrust production while retaining a minimal weight, we develop an optimization framework for the robot and airfoil geometries. The analysis integrates quasi-steady aerodynamic models for the airfoils and the propellers with the motor model. We fabricated the robots according to the optimized design. The prototypes are experimentally tested. The revolving-wing robot produces approximately 50% higher lift compared to conventional multirotor designs.

1901,1901,Empirical Characterization of a High-performance Exterior-rotor Type Brushless DC Motor and Drive,"Recently, brushless motors with especially high torque densities have been developed for applications in autonomous aerial vehicles (i.e. drones), which usually employ exterior rotortype geometries (ER-BLDC motors). These motors are promising for other applications, such as humanoids and wearable robots; however, the emerging companies that produce motors for drone applications do not typically provide adequate technical specifications that would permit their general use across robotics-for example, the specifications are often tested in unrealistic forced convection environments, or are drone-specific, such as thrust efficiency. Furthermore, the high magnetic pole count in many ER-BLDC motors restricts the brushless drives able to efficiently commutate these motors at speeds needed for lightly-geared operation. This paper provides an empirical characterization of a popular ER-BLDC motor and a new brushless drive, which includes efficiencies of the motor across different power regimes, identification of the motor transfer function coefficients, thermal response properties, and closed loop control performance in the time and frequency domains.

1902,1902,Multicamera 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Surgical Cavities: Non-Rigid Registration and Point Classification,"Deformable objects and surfaces are ubiquitous in the daily lives of humans - from the garments in fashion to soft tissues within the body. Because of this routine interaction with soft materials, humans are adept and trained in manipulation of deformable objects while avoiding irreversible damage. The dexterity and care involved is largely facilitated through a combination of the human haptic sense of touch and visual observations of object deformation [1]. While this scenario presents itself as a trivially intuitive task, it becomes significantly more difficult and complex with the deprivation of both 3D depth perception and haptic senses. This deprived state is not dissimilar to the scenarios encountered in many robot-assisted minimally invasive surgeries. As a result, unintentional tissue damage can occur due to lack of force feedback and fine 3D visibility [2]. One approach to remediate these issues combines real-time dynamic 3D reconstruction and vision-based force estimation for haptic feedback. Toward that end, this work continues research in a series of studies focusing on multicamera 3D reconstruction of dynamic surgical cavities. Previous work introduced a novel approach of camera grouping and pair sequencing [3]. This paper builds upon that work by introducing a method for non-rigid, sparse point cloud registration and subsequent point classification. In particular, to enable deformation and force analyses, surfaces are locally classified into three categories: static, shifting and deforming. The topics addressed in this paper present open challenges and ongoing research directions for researchers to this day [4], and provide a step towards real-time 3D reconstruction and force feedback in robot-assisted surgery.",60022967,Trinity College Hartford,Hartford,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.5,0.08286749482401656,0.36030020703933746,1

Another trend in the community is learning of generative models based on generative adversarial networks. In this paper, we propose a framework for 3D point cloud generation based on a combination of auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks. The framework first trains auto-encoders to learn latent representations, and then trains generative adversarial networks in the learned latent space. We focus on improving the training method for auto-encoders in order to generate 3D point clouds with higher fidelity and coverage. We add parallel sub-decoders that reconstruct subsets of the input point cloud. In order to construct these subsets, we introduce a point sampling algorithm that imposes a method to sample spatially localized point sets. These local subsets are utilized to measure local reconstruction losses. We train auto-encoders to learn an effective latent representation for both global and local shape reconstruction based on the multi-task learning approach. Furthermore, we add global and local adversarial losses to generate more plausible point clouds. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art method on the task of 3D point cloud generation.",60021208,KDDI Corporation,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.09090909090909,0.21833333333333332,0.31055555555555553,1

More specifically, the framework contains a video parsing module and a robot execution module. The first module recognizes the demonstrator's actions using two-stream convolution neural networks, and classifies the operated objects by adopting a Mask R-CNN. After that, two XGBoost classifiers are applied to further classify the objects into subject object and patient object respectively, according to the demonstrator's actions. In the second module, a grammar-based parser is used to summarize the videos and generate the common instructions for robot execution. Extensive experiments are conducted on a publicly available video datasets consisting of 273 videos and manifest that our approach is able to learn manipulation plans from demonstration videos with high accuracy (73.36%).

1905,1905,"Plasticity in Collective Decision-Making for Robots: Creating Global Reference Frames, Detecting Dynamic Environments, and Preventing Lock-ins","Swarm robots operate as autonomous agents and a swarm as a whole gets autonomous by its capability of collective decision-making. Despite intensive research on models of collective decision-making, the implementation in multi-robot systems is still challenging. Here, we advance the state of the art by introducing more plasticity to the decision-making process and by increasing the scenario difficulty. Most studies on large-scale multi-robot decision-making are limited to one instance of an iterated exploration-dissemination phase followed by successful and permanent convergence. We investigate a dynamic environment that requires constant collective monitoring of option qualities. Once a significant change in qualities is detected by the swarm, it has to collectively reconsider its previous decision accordingly. This is only possible by preventing lock-ins, a global consensus state of no return (i.e., a dominant majority of robots prevents the swarm from switching to another, possibly better option). In addition, we introduce a scenario of increased difficulty as the robots must locate themselves to assess the quality of an option. Using local communication, swarm robots propagate hop-count information throughout the swarm to form a global reference frame. We successfully validate our implementation in many swarm robot experiments concerning robustness to disruptions of the reference frame, scalability, and adaptivity to a dynamic environment.",60025225,University of Southampton,Southampton,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.7,0.24461451247165533,0.502437641723356,1

The higher the step becomes, the more difficult it is for legged robots to get over from the viewpoint of stability and kinematic reachability. Torso landing contributes to improving stability and robustness of motion for moving onto high step because of lower center of mass (CoM) and larger support polygon, which is seldomly utilized by previous human-sized legged robots. The approaches in this paper consist of the following two components. As for hardware, spikes are arranged on the bottom of robot' s body for stable torso landing on a high step. As for motion generation, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is utilized to generate motion with torso landing to guarantee stability of robots during getting over the high step.

However, it is difficult to adopt large high-power electrical motors in conventional mechanical transmission systems owing to spatial limitations. To address this problem, a hydraulic interlocking drive system that incorporates two hydraulic direct-drive systems is proposed for biped humanoid robots. The hydraulic interlocking drive system connects the two hydraulic direct-drive systems and concentrates the pump output on one side cylinder. The other side cylinder meter-in flow rate is controlled by the meter-out flow rate from the cylinder on which the pump is concentrated. Good position tracking and excellent energy saving are achieved with the proposed system. A performance comparison with a single hydraulic direct-drive system shows that the motor power of the hip pitch joint is reduced by 27.3% for walking patterns. This result shows that the rated output of the motor can be reduced, and smaller and lighter motors can be installed in biped robots.",60023462,Waseda University,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.25,0.11944444444444444,0.4972222222222222,1

Detection of UALs is challenging due to large variance of underwater illumination, water quality and change of camera viewpoint. Moreover, improvement of detection accuracy relies upon statistical diversity of images used to train detection models. We propose a generative adversarial network, called Tank-to-field GAN (T2FGAN), to learn generative models of underwater images, and use the learned models for data augmentation to improve detection accuracy. To this end, first a T2FGAN is trained using images of UALs captured in a tank. Then, the learned model of the T2FGAN is used to generate images of UALs according to different water quality, illumination, pose and landmark configurations (WIPCs). In experimental analyses, we first explore statistical properties of images of UALs generated by T2FGAN under various WIPCs for active landmark detection. Then, we use the generated images for training detection algorithms. Experimental results show that training detection algorithms using the generated images can improve detection accuracy.

We therefore created Carpie, a robotic caterpillar adapted from a modular, pneumatic actuator. Carpie is designed to perform a variety of caterpillar movements by tuning its mechanical structure through physical reconfiguration. The robot has a completely soft body that enables a variety of movements and contortions into different shapes, making Carpie is perhaps the perfect example to showcase a soft robot's aptness for animal mimicry. We analyzed the robot's control aspect. Its capabilities were measured by performing gait velocity studies on three different configurations. Each configuration was executed by applying various modules on Carpie's structure without fully refabricating the entire assembly. We also analyzed the accompanying change in the robot's maximum height during gait.

1912,1912,PD based Robust Quadratic Programs for Robotic Systems,"In this paper, inspired by Proportional-Derivative (PD) control laws, we present a class of Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) based Quadratic Programs (QPs) for robotic systems. Proportional-Derivative (PD) control laws are independent of the robot model, however, they fail to incorporate physical constraints, such as torque saturation. On the other hand, most optimization based control design approaches ensure satisfaction of the physical constraints, but they are sensitive to errors in the robot model. The PD based Quadratic Programs (PD-QPs), presented in this paper, are a first step towards bridging this gap between the PD and the optimization based controllers to bring the best of both together.

1913,1913,Improved Exploration through Latent Trajectory Optimization in Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient,"Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) often require additional exploration strategies, especially if the actor is of deterministic nature. This work evaluates the use of model-based trajectory optimization methods used for exploration in Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient when trained on a latent image embedding. In addition, an extension of DDPG is derived using a value function as critic, making use of a learned deep dynamics model to compute the policy gradient. This approach leads to a symbiotic relationship between the deep reinforcement learning algorithm and the latent trajectory optimizer. The trajectory optimizer benefits from the critic learned by the RL algorithm and the latter from the enhanced exploration generated by the planner. The developed methods are evaluated on two continuous control tasks, one in simulation and one in the real world.

This paper focuses on motion planning for one particular setup wherein a six-legged robot braces itself between two vertical walls and climbs vertically with end effectors that only use friction. Instead of motion planning with a single nonlinear programming (NLP) solver, we decoupled the problem into two parts with distinct physical meaning: torso postures and contact forces. The first part can be formulated as either a mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) or NLP problem, while the second part is formulated as a series of standard convex optimization problems.

1916,1916,Frustum ConvNet: Sliding Frustums to Aggregate Local Point-Wise Features for Amodal,"In this work, we propose a novel method termed Frustum ConvNet (F-ConvNet) for amodal 3D object detection from point clouds. Given 2D region proposals in an RGB image, our method first generates a sequence of frustums for each region proposal, and uses the obtained frustums to group local points. F-ConvNet aggregates point-wise features as frustum-level feature vectors, and arrays these feature vectors as a feature map for use of its subsequent component of fully convolutional network (FCN), which spatially fuses frustum-level features and supports an end-to-end and continuous estimation of oriented boxes in the 3D space. We also propose component variants of F-ConvNet, including an FCN variant that extracts multi-resolution frustum features, and a refined use of F-ConvNet over a reduced 3D space. Careful ablation studies verify the efficacy of these component variants. F-ConvNet assumes no prior knowledge of the working 3D environment and is thus dataset-agnostic. We present experiments on both the indoor SUN-RGBD and outdoor KITTI datasets. F-ConvNet outperforms all existing methods on SUN-RGBD, and at the time of submission it outperforms all published works on the KITTI benchmark.

1919,1919,Talk to the Vehicle: Language Conditioned Autonomous Navigation of Self Driving Cars,"We propose a novel pipeline that blends encodings from natural language and 3D semantic maps obtained from visual imagery to generate local trajectories that are executed by a low-level controller. The pipeline precludes the need for a prior registered map through a local waypoint generator neural network. The waypoint generator network (WGN) maps semantics and natural language encodings (NLE) to local waypoints. A local planner then generates a trajectory from the ego location of the vehicle (an outdoor car in this case) to these locally generated waypoints while a low-level controller executes these plans faithfully. The efficacy of the pipeline is verified in the CARLA simulator environment as well as on local semantic maps built from real-world KITTI dataset. In both these environments (simulated and real-world) we show the ability of the WGN to generate waypoints accurately by mapping NLE of varying sequence lengths and levels of complexity. We compare with baseline approaches and show significant performance gain over them. And finally, we show real implementations on our electric car verifying that the pipeline lends itself to practical and tangible realizations in uncontrolled outdoor settings. In loop execution of the proposed pipeline that involves repetitive invocations of the network is critical for any such language-based navigation framework.

1921,1921,Detecting layered structures of partially occluded objects for bin picking,"When robots engage in bin picking of multiple objects, a failure in grasping partially occluded objects may occur because other objects may overlap the desired ones. Therefore, the layered structure of objects needs to be detected, and the picking order needs to be established. In this paper, we propose a new dataset that evaluates not only the area of objects but also the layered structures of objects. In this dataset, three tasks are targeted: object detection, semantic segmentation, and segmentation of occluded areas for bin picking of multiple objects. The dataset, called 'the Amazon Robotics Challenge (ARC) Multi-task Dataset' contains 1,500 RGB images and depth images, including all scenes containing bounding box labels, semantic segmentation labels, and occluded area labels. This enables representing the layered structure of overlapped objects with a tree structure. A benchmark of the ARC multi-task dataset demonstrated that occluded areas could be segmented using a Mask regional convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and that layered structures of objects could be predicted.

This paper presents an unsupervised segmentation approach to automatically segment a given surgical task without manual intervention. A new segmentation method is presented, which relies only on bimanual kinematic trajectories without the need for prior information about the data. Specifically, surgical tasks are segmented by fusing trajectories' spatiotemporal and variance properties. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, detailed experiments were first conducted on our dataset. We segmented trajectories of three different surgical stitches and observed an average F1 score of 77.9% against the ground truths. The same trajectories were then added with different levels of noises and the segmentation comparison was made with four other methods. The proposed algorithm had demonstrated its robustness against the noises.

1923,1923,Prediction of Wind Speed Distribution Using Artificial Neural Network: The Case of Saudi Arabia," Published by Elsevier B.V.Besides geometric and aerodynamic wind turbine parameters, wind speed and nonlinear fluctuations represent the main components in the prediction of the aerodynamic loads and performance of wind turbines. Determining wind speed characteristics is crucial in the computation of the power generated, loads and stress on rotor blades, and the fatigue of structural components. In this paper, we propose the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) method to forecast the daily wind speed at some locations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using multiple local meteorological measurement data provided by K.A.CARE. The available database used for ANN prediction is divided into training and validation sets. The attributes for the training includes among others the time of the day, the year, the latitude and longitude, air temperature, wind direction, humidity, and pressure. The suggested model is a feed-forward neural network model with the administered learning technique using the back-propagation algorithm. The sigmoid function has been adopted as an activation function at the second layer and linear activation in the output layer. Based on the different tests conducted, the best values of the correlation coefficient R and the Root Mean Square Error RMSE were obtained with a learning phase of 60% of the training set 40% of testing. By increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the best structure was obtained for 10 neurons in the hidden layers matching a minimum of MSE and the highest value of R. The model has been implemented using WEKA software where numerical validation with data from meteorological stations has confirmed that the proposed model shows good agreement. The significance of the study relies on its ability to predict the daily wind speed, select the best site for wind turbine installation, ensure a secure and reliable electrical power output, and help the operators in a wind farm to manage efficiently the generated power.

1924,1924,The RGB-D Triathlon: Towards Agile Visual Toolboxes for Robots,"Deep networks have brought significant advances in robot perception, enabling to improve the capabilities of robots in several visual tasks, ranging from object detection and recognition to pose estimation, semantic scene segmentation and many others. Still, most approaches typically address visual tasks in isolation, resulting in overspecialized models which achieve strong performances in specific applications but work poorly in other (often related) tasks. This is clearly sub-optimal for a robot which is often required to perform simultaneously multiple visual recognition tasks in order to properly act and interact with the environment. This problem is exacerbated by the limited computational and memory resources typically available onboard to a robotic platform. The problem of learning flexible models which can handle multiple tasks in a lightweight manner has recently gained attention in the computer vision community and benchmarks supporting this research have been proposed. In this work we study this problem in the robot vision context, proposing a new benchmark, the RGB-D Triathlon, and evaluating state of the art algorithms in this novel challenging scenario. We also define a new evaluation protocol, better suited to the robot vision setting.

We extract the child's pose from different RGB-D cameras placed regularly in the room, fuse the results and feed them to a deep Neural Network (NN) trained for classifying engagement levels. The deep network contains a recurrent layer, in order to exploit the rich temporal information contained in the pose data. The resulting method outperforms a number of baseline classifiers and provides a promising tool for better automatic understanding of a child's attitude, interest and attention while cooperating with a robot.

1926,1926,Neural-Learning Trajectory Tracking Control of Flexible-Joint Robot Manipulators with Unknown Dynamics,"Fast and precise motion control is important for industrial robots in manufacturing applications. However, some collaborative robots sacrifice precision for safety, particular for high motion speed. The performance degradation is caused by the inability of the joint servo controller to address the uncertain nonlinear dynamics of the robot arm, e.g., due to joint flexibility. We consider two approaches to improve the trajectory tracking performance through feedforward compensation. The first approach uses iterative learning control, with the gradient-based iterative update generated from the robot forward dynamics model. The second approach uses dynamic inversion to directly compensate for the robot forward dynamics. If the forward dynamics is strictly proper or is non-minimum-phase (e.g., due to time delays), its stable inverse would be non-causal. Both approaches require robot dynamical models. This paper presents results of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to approximate these dynamical models - forward dynamics in the first case, inverse dynamics (possibly non-causal) in the second case. We use the bi-directional RNN to capture the noncausality. The RNNs are trained based on a collection of commanded trajectories and the actual robot responses. We use a Baxter robot to evaluate the two approaches. The Baxter robot exhibits significant joint flexibility due to the series-elastic joint actuators. Both approaches achieve sizable improvement over the uncompensated robot motion, for both random joint trajectories and Cartesian motion. The inverse dynamics method is particularly attractive as it may be used to more accurately track a user input as in teleoperation.",60025534,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,Troy,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",16.333333333333336,0.11855072463768117,0.4756521739130434,1
1928,1928,Common Dimensional Autoencoder for Learning Redundant Muscle-Posture Mappings of Complex Musculoskeletal Robots,"It has been widely considered that a distinctive feature of musculoskeletal structures is that both the joint angle and stiffness can be changed by exploiting the agonistantagonist driving of the joint. However, musculoskeletal systems in animals and humans are typically highly complex, and the simple agonist-antagonist driving is rarely found. Therefore, in accordance with the increasing complexity of musculoskeletal robots, the feature that causes the robot to assume a posture with different stiffness values becomes difficult to achieve, owing to the difficulty in modeling the kinematics. Although datadriven approaches such as the neural network are regarded as suitable for modeling complex relationships, the training data are difficult to obtain because measuring joint stiffness is typically extremely difficult in contrast to measuring an actuator's state and posture. Hence, we herein propose the common dimensional autoencoder where the encoded feature exhibits identical dimensions to the original input vector. In the proposed network, in parallel with the original unsupervised training using the data of the actuators' states, supervised training at part of the encoded features is performed using posture data. Consequently, features expressing the redundancy of inverse kinematics appear at the remaining part of the encoded features without using data such as joint stiffness. The validity of the proposed method was confirmed successfully through an experiment using a 10 degrees-of-freedom complex musculoskeletal robot arm driven by pneumatic artificial muscles.",60031838,Kyushu Institute of Technology,Kitakyushu,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.25,-0.03250000000000001,0.6578571428571428,1

However, there are multiple grasping methods for one object. In order to select a motion suitable for the direction, it is important to estimate candidates of grasping method for the object. In this research, we purpose to recall candidates of grasping position and hand shape from an object image.

Even though these tasks are easy and repeatable, they are still not automated. The Mobile Extendable Robot Arm (MERA) is a movable robot arm with a novel 2-DOF scissor mechanism for reaching a high place and positioning an end-effector.

Placing the end-effector at an arbitrary point in space, the 4-DOF arm possesses two degrees of redundancy, allowing access to a point from various directions and enabling obstacle avoidance. In this paper, we present the design and analysis of the 2-DOF scissor mechanism. The 2-DOF scissor mechanism has two rotary actuators for driving the base links individually; consequently, the mechanism can elongate the entire body and tilt at the center of the base shaft.

This paper presents the development of an autonomous sanding robot, which is able to perform the sanding works on an unknown object automatically, without any prior calibration or human intervention. The developed robot works as follows. First, the target object is scanned then modeled with the structured-light camera. Second, the robot motion is planned to cover all the surfaces of the object with an optimized transition sequence. Third, the robot is controlled to perform the sanding on the object under the desired impedance model.

The dynamic interaction between the flexible object and the gripper is elaborated by analyzing how energy is exchanged. We also discuss the condition on friction to prevent loss of contact.

Perspective-n-Points (PnP) methods estimate this matrix from a set of paired point coordinates, given by the simultaneous position of a spherical marker on the image (2D coordinates) and in the external localizer frame (3D coordinates). In this paper, the PnP calibration is restated as an iterative Perspective-n-Spheres (PnS) problem: the spherical geometry of the marker is taken into account when computing the projection of its 3D center into the 2D image plane. Using calibration residuals as evaluation matrix, the proposed PnS provides better results compared to the State-of-the-Art (SoA) PnP methods. Furthermore, results show that the calibration yields different estimates due to different camera poses in the working volume.

In particular, the deformable nature of the rope results in the vibration to the manipulator and hence affects the positioning of the end effector. In this paper, a new adaptive vision-based controller is proposed for RCRM, which enables the robot to carry out the high-accuracy task under the unknown vibration from the rope. The proposed controller guarantees the performance of the robot in twofold. First, the control problem is directly formulated in the image space such that the exact spatial relationship between the moving base of the manipulator (due to the vibrating rope) and the target (e.g. the wall) is not required. Second, novel adaptation laws are developed to estimate the vibration from the rope online and are cancelled out in the robot control input to stabilize the end effector.

1938,1938,Planning beyond the Sensing Horizon Using a Learned Context,"Last-mile delivery systems commonly propose the use of autonomous robotic vehicles to increase scalability and efficiency. The economic inefficiency of collecting accurate prior maps for navigation motivates the use of planning algorithms that operate in unmapped environments. However, these algorithms typically waste time exploring regions that are unlikely to contain the delivery destination. Context is key information about structured environments that could guide exploration toward the unknown goal location, but the abstract idea is difficult to quantify for use in a planning algorithm. Some approaches specifically consider contextual relationships between objects, but would perform poorly in object-sparse environments like outdoors. Recent deep learningbased approaches consider context too generally, making training/transferability difficult. Therefore, this work proposes a novel formulation of utilizing context for planning as an image-to-image translation problem, which is shown to extract terrain context from semantic gridmaps, into a metric that an exploration-based planner can use. The proposed framework has the benefit of training on a static dataset instead of requiring a time-consuming simulator. Across 42 test houses with layouts from satellite images, the trained algorithm enables a robot to reach its goal 189% faster than with a context-unaware planner, and within 63% of the optimal path computed with a prior map. The proposed algorithm is also implemented on a vehicle with a forward-facing camera in a high-fidelity, Unreal simulation of neighborhood houses.",60029798,Ford Motor Company,Dearborn,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.4,-0.058333333333333334,0.499074074074074,1

1940,1940,Combined Task and Action Learning from Human Demonstrations for Mobile Manipulation Applications,"Learning from demonstrations is a promising paradigm for transferring knowledge to robots. However, learning mobile manipulation tasks directly from a human teacher is a complex problem as it requires learning models of both the overall task goal and of the underlying actions. Additionally, learning from a small number of demonstrations often introduces ambiguity with respect to the intention of the teacher, making it challenging to commit to one model for generalizing the task to new settings. In this paper, we present an approach to learning flexible mobile manipulation action models and task goal representations from teacher demonstrations. Our action models enable the robot to consider different likely outcomes of each action and to generate feasible trajectories for achieving them. Accordingly, we leverage a probabilistic framework based on Monte Carlo tree search to compute sequences of feasible actions imitating the teacher intention in new settings without requiring the teacher to specify an explicit goal state.

In this work, we show that using synthetic datasets that are not necessarily photo-realistic can be a better alternative to simply fine-tune pre-trained networks. Specifically, our results show an impressive 25%improvement in the mAP metric over a fine-tuning baseline when only about 200 labelled images are available to train.

Image reconstruction is an ill-posed inverse problem of computer vision. Generally, distortion in satellite images modeled as their convolution with an Airy pattern Point Spread Function (PSF) of circular symmetry and additive white Gaussian noise. The MRCNN training needs a few satellite images, to yield a reconstructed image during testing, with the goals of generalized and optimized restoration. Thus, it must manage a tradeoff between two objectives of optimization and generalization. The image to be restored is not provided to the network during training. The CNN has already proven its effectiveness in image classification and recognition but not thoroughly evaluated on multivariate regression and inverse problems of image processing and computer vision. Therefore, we experimented with different architectures of CNN feasible on a GPU embedded PC for an effective reconstruction of satellite images.

In this paper, we present a novel buckling-induced mechanism for shape morphing using dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), by bonding the planar precursor structure's 'feet' with the DEA. With spatially-varying electric fields applied, the inplane deformation of the DEA generates compressive loads to trigger buckling of planar precursors into desired three-dimensional configurations. To enlarge the achievable motion range at the 'feet', we develop a design optimization approach to the electrode arrangement which is concisely described by cosine functions. By numerically optimizing the cosine function coefficients, we obtain the optimal spatially-varying electrodes for various precursors with different patterns of bonding sites. The experimental results demonstrate the remarkable shape-morphing from two dimensions to three dimensional configurations.

The footstep optimization is formulated as a discrete-time Model Predictive Control problem which determines future footstep locations. The framework has a hierarchical structure consisting of three layers: footstep planner, trajectory generator and whole-body controller. The footstep planner plans next footstep position based on Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model. Relative footstep optimization is proposed to enable automatic footstep planning without the use of any predefined footstep sequences. The trajectory generator will generate CoM and feet trajectory given the next footstep placement. In order to generalize to quadruped robots, 'virtual leg' concept has been used to coordinate leg pair movement. The whole-body inverse dynamic controller calculates joint torques to track given Cartesian reference trajectories. To include under-actuation into consideration, contact vertices formulation of ground reaction forces (GRFs) has been adopted.

1949,1949,Uncertainty-Aware Imitation Learning using Kernelized Movement Primitives,"During the past few years, probabilistic approaches to imitation learning have earned a relevant place in the robotics literature. One of their most prominent features is that, in addition to extracting a mean trajectory from task demonstrations, they provide a variance estimation. The intuitive meaning of this variance, however, changes across different techniques, indicating either variability or uncertainty. In this paper we leverage kernelized movement primitives (KMP) to provide a new perspective on imitation learning by predicting variability, correlations and uncertainty using a single model. This rich set of information is used in combination with the fusion of optimal controllers to learn robot actions from data, with two main advantages: i) robots become safe when uncertain about their actions and ii) they are able to leverage partial demonstrations, given as elementary sub-tasks, to optimally perform a higher level, more complex task. We showcase our approach in a painting task, where a human user and a KUKA robot collaborate to paint a wooden board. The task is divided into two sub-tasks and we show that the robot becomes compliant (hence safe) outside the training regions and executes the two sub-tasks with optimal gains otherwise.",60102151,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia,Genoa,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",27.571428571428573,0.13030979437229437,0.4235276875901876,1

To prevent the operator from disconnecting the swarm, this paper develops a constructive strategy to dynamically modulate the interconnections of, and the local damping injections at, all slave robots. Lyapunov-based set invariance analysis shows that the strategy preserves all interaction links in the tree network while synchronizing the slave swarm. By properly limiting the impact of the user command rather than rejecting it entirely, the proposed explicit gain update law enables the operator to guide the motion of the slave swarm to the extent to which it does not endanger swarm connectivity.

1952,1952,Inference of user-intention in remote robot wheelchair assistance using multimodal interfaces,"Shared control methodologies have the potential of enabling wheelchair-bound users with limited motor abilities to perform tasks that would usually be beyond their capabilities. Deriving such methodologies in advance is challenging, since they are frequently heavily dependent on unique characteristics of users. Learning Assistance by Demonstration paradigms allow derivation of customized policies by recording how remote human assistants assist particular users. However, for accurate determination of the optimal policies for each user and context, the remote assistant needs to infer the intention of the driver, which is frequently obscured by noisy signals dependent on the user's motor impairment. In this paper, we propose a multimodal teleoperation interface, incorporating map information, haptic feedback and user eye-gaze data, and examine which of these factors are most important for allowing accurate determination of user intention in a simulated tremor experiment. Our study indicates that, for expert assistants, presence of additional haptic and gaze information increases their ability to accurately infer the user's intention, providing supporting evidence for the utility of multimodal interfaces in remote assistance scenarios for Learning Assistance by Demonstration. Our study also reveals strong individual preferences on the different modalities, with large variations of performance occurring depending on whether supplemental eye-gaze or haptic information was given.",60015150,Imperial College London,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",29.285714285714285,0.14425465838509316,0.5016563146997929,1

The key part of the network is dropout layers which are enabled not only during training but also at run-time to generate a set of shape samples representing the shape uncertainty through Monte Carlo sampling. Given the set of shape completed objects, we generate grasp candidates on the mean object shape but evaluate them based on their joint performance in terms of analytical grasp metrics on all the shape candidates. We experimentally validate and benchmark our method against another state-of-the-art method with a Barrett hand on 90000 grasps in simulation and 200 grasps on a real Franka Emika Panda.

This paper presents a bipedal robot equipped with a trunk, embedding a viscoelastic joint and two arms away from the midline of the trunk. Physical experiments show that a passive oscillation of the viscoelastic trunk joint around the yaw axis vertical to the ground and a swing of heavy arms provided an oscillation of zero moment point (ZMP) in the lateral direction and a small oscillation in the anteroposterior direction. This is despite the fact that the robot does not have a roll joint and the arm swings back and forth.

The computation of motions for parts assembly usually requires an exact model of all relevant objects. Generating detailed object models, including friction and dynamics, is often complex and time-consuming, especially in the context of elastic parts. In addition, executing motions on real hardware will usually introduce further uncertainty. For this reason, we propose an approach that is inherently robust against model parameter uncertainties and unknown characteristics of elastic parts. Our planner explicitly takes into account the internal states of articulated objects, as well as uncertain model parameters, by constructing a search tree in the belief-parameter-space. It yields successful assembly motions from coarse object models and thus eliminates the need for detailed parameter tuning. We evaluated our approach with respect to four assembly tasks.

1964,1964,Exploiting linearity in dynamics solvers for the design of composable robotic manipulation architectures,"We investigate two major limiting factors in the design and implementation of modern dynamics solvers that interfere with their full utilization in versatile, manipulation-driven robotic software architectures. The first limitation originates from the design of those solvers which aims at computational efficiency while neglecting composability. Instead, we advocate to design the solvers in such a way that they exploit linearity in the equations of motion to fully decompose the state of a kinematic chain. This enables a versatile recomposition and more flexible applications. Secondly, we have observed that most implementations follow the programming principle of information hiding. Consequently, the internal state that is used to compute motion control commands is withheld from other parts of the software architecture. We tackle this problem by following a dataflow programming paradigm and separating the software's dataflow from the control flow. Thereafter, we demonstrate those two simple, yet effective strategies to overcome the limitations along various case studies.",60032882,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Eindhoven,Netherlands,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.25,0.1491666666666667,0.3676984126984127,1

However, increases in body weight due to the neck unit will make energetic issues in legged robots' locomotion more serious. This study presents a minimal decentralized coordination mechanism between a neck and limbs, especially focusing on quadruped mammals' nodding behaviors for efficient walking. The results of two dimensional (2D) simulation suggest that bilateral sensory feedback mechanism between neck and limbs plays essential roles for the quadruped robot to coordinate neck and limbs in response to the physical situation of the body parts, achieving efficient quadrupedal walking.",60008435,Tohoku University,Sendai,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.5,0.034166666666666665,0.47845238095238096,1
1966,1966,Hybrid Visual Servoing for Autonomous Robotic Laser Tattoo Removal,"Laser tattoo removal is a standard non-invasive method for removing color pigments on the skin. Increasing number of tattooed people who want to remove their tattoo has driven the medical laser market to develop new technologies for painless, scar-free and complete tattoo removal. However, manual use of such laser systems creates post-operative complications since they do not guarantee (i) protection on non-tattooed skin from laser exposure, nor (ii) precise control of the laser focus during the operations for best performance. This paper introduces deTattoo, a robotic system to improve tattoo removal operations. A robotic arm is equipped with a RGB-D camera and a visible laser, in eye-in-end configuration. A hybrid visual servoing control is proposed to guarantee the correct pose of the laser with respect to the tattooed tissue while compensating body motions. 2D features tracked with a mass-spring-damper deformable mesh model are combined with the 3D reconstruction retrieved from a RGB-D camera in order to build the control law. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the system with a fixed or moving tattooed surface, at different inclinations. Results showed that the proposed framework is able to fulfil the laser-based tattoo removal requirements, providing high positioning accuracy (\lt 1 mm) orientation (\lt 0. 2{\circ}) and body motion compensation.",60102151,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia,Genoa,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.1,0.14642424242424243,0.3213030303030303,1

We demonstrate that when the leading object edge in each sonar image can be accurately triangulated in 3D, the remaining surface may be 'filled in' using a generative sensor model. This process generates a full three-dimensional point cloud for each image in the sequence. We propose integrating these surface measurements into a cohesive global map using a truncated signed distance field (TSDF) to fuse the point clouds generated by each image. This allows for reconstructing surfaces with significantly fewer sonar images and viewpoints than previous methods. The proposed method is evaluated by reconstructing a mock-up piling structure and a real world underwater piling, in a test tank environment and in the field, respectively. Our surface reconstructions are quantitatively compared to ground-truth models and are shown to be more accurate than previous state-of-the-art algorithms.",60104841,The Robotics Institute,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.571428571428573,0.1790792540792541,0.4368881118881119,1

By drawing a connection to the watchman's route problem, we find a set of conditions that must be satisfied by the p-route. Then we propose a metric for tracking to estimate a sufficient speed for the observer given the geometry of the environment. We show that the problem of finding the p-route on which the observer requires minimum speed is computationally intractable. We present a technique to find a p-route on which the observer needs at most twice the minimum speed to track the intruder and a reactive motion strategy for the observer.",60004354,Iowa State University,Ames,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.2,0.2,0.42000000000000004,1

Handheld robots share the shape and properties of handheld tools while being able to process task information and aid manipulation. Here, we propose an intention prediction model to enhance cooperative task solving. The model derives intention from the combined information about the user's gaze pattern and task knowledge. Within experimental studies, the model is validated through a comparison of user frustration for the case where the robot follows the predicted location of the user's intended action versus doing the opposite (rebellion). The proposed model yields real-time capabilities and reliable accuracy up to 1.5 s prior to predicted actions being executed.",60020650,University of Bristol,Bristol,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.666666666666668,0.13999999999999999,0.225,1
1970,1970,Agent Prioritization for Autonomous Navigation,"In autonomous navigation, a planning system reasons about other agents to plan a safe and plausible trajectory. Before planning starts, agents are typically processed with computationally intensive models for recognition, tracking, motion estimation and prediction. With limited computational resources and a large number of agents to process in real time, it becomes important to efficiently rank agents according to their impact on the decision making process. This allows spending more time processing the most important agents. We propose a system to rank agents around an autonomous vehicle (AV) in real time. We automatically generate a ranking data set by running the planner in simulation on real-world logged data, where we can afford to run more accurate and expensive models on all the agents. The causes of various planner actions are logged and used for assigning ground truth importance scores. The generated data set can be used to learn ranking models. In particular, we show the utility of combining learned features, via a convolutional neural network, with engineered features designed to capture domain knowledge. We show the benefits of various design choices experimentally. When tested on real AVs, our system demonstrates the capability of understanding complex driving situations.",60111160,Waymo LLC,Mountain View,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",17.90909090909091,0.11271428571428571,0.5405238095238096,1
1971,1971,Multimodal Uncertainty Reduction for Intention Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction,"Assistive robots can potentially improve the quality of life and personal independence of elderly people by supporting everyday life activities. To guarantee a safe and intuitive interaction between human and robot, human intentions need to be recognized automatically. As humans communicate their intentions multimodally, the use of multiple modalities for intention recognition may not just increase the robustness against failure of individual modalities but especially reduce the uncertainty about the intention to be recognized. This is desirable as particularly in direct interaction between robots and potentially vulnerable humans a minimal uncertainty about the situation as well as knowledge about this actual uncertainty is necessary. Thus, in contrast to existing methods, in this work a new approach for multimodal intention recognition is introduced that focuses on uncertainty reduction through classifier fusion. For the four considered modalities speech, gestures, gaze directions and scene objects individual intention classifiers are trained, all of which output a probability distribution over all possible intentions. By combining these output distributions using the Bayesian method Independent Opinion Pool [1] the uncertainty about the intention to be recognized can be decreased. The approach is evaluated in a collaborative human-robot interaction task with a 7-DoF robot arm. The results show that fused classifiers, which combine multiple modalities, outperform the respective individual base classifiers with respect to increased accuracy, robustness, and reduced uncertainty.",60011226,Technische Universität Darmstadt,Darmstadt,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.666666666666668,-0.05321212121212121,0.45318181818181813,1

We believe the function will have a major role in legged robots as a typical high-load application of robotics. Some pioneering works have been ongoing on self-healing soft robots. However, the development of large load self-healing component and its system integration with a life-sized legged robot is a challenging task. This study is to try the problem by a constructing self-healing component oriented for facilitated investigation. Proposed part enhances visibility and manufacturing by specializing tension transmission system. The developed module was evaluated by several experiments. First, healing visualization experiment was conducted to evaluate healing progress. In addition, the module's strength was tested using a motor-driven tendon module previously developed in our laboratory. Results of these experiments suggested that the stirring process have a major role in performing self-healing behaviour. Finally, we conducted a preliminary experiment on a tendon-driven legged robot. The experiment demonstrated that the module functioned in a real robot once.",60025272,University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",13.25,0.11712454212454214,0.45860805860805853,1
1973,1973,Dynamic Control of Soft Robots with Internal Constraints in the Presence of Obstacles,"The development of effective reduced order models for soft robots is paving the way toward the development of a new generation of model based techniques, which leverage classic rigid robot control. However, several soft robot features differentiate the soft-bodied case from the rigid-bodied one. First, soft robots are built to work in the environment, so the presence of obstacles in their path should always be explicitly accounted by their control systems. Second, due to the complex kinematics, the actuation of soft robots is mapped to the state space nonlinearly resulting in spaces with different sizes. Moreover, soft robots often include internal constraints and thus actuation is typically limited in the range of action and it is often unidirectional. This paper proposes a control pipeline to tackle the challenge of controlling soft robots with internal constraints in environments with obstacles. We show how the constraints on actuation can be propagated and integrated with geometrical constraints, taking into account physical limits imposed by the presence of obstacles. We present a hierarchical control architecture capable of handling these constraints, with which we are able to regulate the position in space of the tip of a soft robot with the discussed characteristics.",60028868,Università di Pisa,Pisa,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.75,0.074318582651916,0.2588985088985089,1

However, there are very few approaches for learning-assisted constrained path-planning on graphs, while there are multiple downstream practical applications. This is the case for constrained path-planning for Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles (AUGV), typically deployed in disaster relief or search and rescue applications. In off-road environments, the AUGV must dynamically optimize a source-destination path under various operational constraints, out of which several are difficult to predict in advance and need to be addressed on-line. We propose a hybrid solving planner that combines machine learning models and an optimal solver. More specifically, a graph convolutional network(GCN) is used to assist a branch and bound(BB) algorithm in handling the constraints. We conduct experiments on realistic scenarios and show that GCN support enables substantial speedup and smoother scaling to harder problems.",60104109,Valeo,Paris Cedex 17,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.285714285714285,0.0040000000000000036,0.36633333333333334,1
1975,1975,Optimal temporal logic planning with cascading soft constraints,"In this paper, we address the problem of temporal logic planning given both hard specifications of the robot's mission and soft preferences on the plans that achieve the mission. In particular, we consider a problem whose inputs are a transition system, a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula specifying the robot's mission, and an ordered sequence of formulas expressed in linear dynamic logic over finite traces (LDLf) specifying the user's preferences for how the mission should be completed. The planner's objective is to synthesize, on this transition system, an infinite trajectory that best fits the user's preferences over finite prefixes of that trajectory while nonetheless satisfying the overall objective. We describe an algorithm for this problem that constructs, from the inputs, a product automaton - which is, in fact, a special kind of state-weighted Büchi automaton - over which an optimal trajectory is synthesized. This synthesis problem is solved via reduction to the minimax path problem in vertex weighted graphs, which can be solved by variants of the standard algorithms for computing shortest paths in a graph or by algorithms for the all-pairs bottleneck paths problem on vertex-weighted graphs.

A range of algorithms for finding parameterized policies that optimize for long-term average performance have been proposed in the past. However, the majority of the proposed approaches does not explicitly take into account the variability of the performance metric, which may lead to finding policies that although performing well on average, can perform spectacularly bad in a particular run or over a period of time. To address this shortcoming, we study an approach to policy optimization that explicitly takes into account higher order statistics of the reward function. In this paper, we extend policy gradient methods to include the entropic risk measure in the objective function and evaluate their performance in simulation experiments and on a real-robot task of learning a hitting motion in robot badminton.",60011226,Technische Universität Darmstadt,Darmstadt,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.8,-0.08333333333333333,0.34500000000000003,1

This paper presents a first prototype of compliant dual arm as preliminary step towards the realization of a winged aerial robot capable of perching and manipulating with the wings folded. The dual arm provides 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) for end effector positioning in a human-like kinematic configuration, with a reach of 25 cm (half-scale w.r.t. the human arm), and 0.2 kg weight. The prototype is built with micro metal gear motors, measuring the joint angles and the deflection with small potentiometers. The paper covers the design, electronics, modeling and control of the arms.

Whether in the private or government sector, corruptions, financial misconduct and malpractices have always been associated with lack of proper auditing and ineffective internal control systems. Various initiatives have been developed to reduce the negative perception of public sector frauds including the implementation of whistleblowing practices in public sector. However, to date, it is still questionable whether this practice is efficient and effective due to the increasing trend in reported frauds in the government departments. Thus, this study examines the practice of whistleblowing in Malaysian public sector agencies. Total of 500 questionnaires are distributed to the internal auditors in public sector agencies. To achieve the objective of this study, the application of artificial intelligence in the practice of the whistleblowing will be examined to see the effectiveness of this practice. The findings are expected to enhance the new Malaysian government initiatives in fighting frauds and corruptions.

However, it remains rare to see real applications of such techniques to modern Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) systems, especially in driving scenarios. In this paper, we revisit the geometric approach to this problem, and provide a theoretical proof that explicitly shows the ambiguity between radial distortion and scene depth when two-view geometry is used to self-calibrate the radial distortion. In view of such geometric degeneracy, we propose a learning approach that trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a large amount of synthetic data.

In this paper, we present the results of an IRB-approved human-robot interaction study that examines how the members of a hierarchical relationship involved in conflict respond to the presence of an unengaged robot. This study serves as a baseline for additional studies. The unengaged robot appears to have a minimal influence on the interaction. The observed conflicts followed the patterns typically described in mediation literature. Our lab previously proposed a computational model to identify weakness and alienation in these relationships. We discuss a partial implementation of this model, and its ability to recognize problems in certain relationships within the data collected.

1981,1981,Identification of Rat Ultrasonic Vocalizations from Mix Sounds of a Robotic Rat in a Noisy Environment,"Social interaction between a robot and rats is important since the robot can generate reproducible social behaviors across trials. However, lacking internal state feedback from the rat makes current robot-rat interaction a very preliminary level comparing with rat-rat interaction. Previous biological studies showed that ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted by a rat are expressions of its internal emotional states, which therefore can be used as part of feedback for a robot-rat interaction. The challenge is to accurately identify rat USVs in real-time from mix sounds generated by the robot in a noisy environment. To address these problems, we propose an SVM-based rat USVs identification method. This SVM method uses three types of features to represents the characteristics of mix sound and use these multidimensional features to identify rat USVs. Results show that our identification method has an accuracy of 84.29% with only 4.84% false-positive rate. Furthermore, we carefully design the filter window length with respect to sound chunk length and use only one microphone to record the mix sound. All of these efforts are to reduce the calculation time to realize real-time identification. Eventually, the identification process can be executed within 3. 5ms, which definitely meet the real-time demand. This research lays the foundation of the feedback based interaction between rat and robot, and also shows promise in the study of ethology and the interaction between robot and animals.",60023462,Waseda University,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.0,0.11764705882352941,0.46960784313725495,1

In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Interaction Manager, a framework for an assistive robot that maintains an active multimodal interaction with a human partner while performing physical collaborative tasks. The heart of our framework is a Hierarchical Bipartite Action-Transition Network (HBATN), which allows the robot to infer the state of the task and the dialogue given spoken utterances and observed pointing gestures from a human partner, and to plan its next actions.

Recent works in goal babbling have demonstrated successful learning of inverse kinematics (IK) on such systems, and suggest that babbling in the goal space better resolves motor redundancy by learning as few yet efficient sensorimotor mappings as possible. However, for musculoskeletal robot systems, motor redundancy can provide useful information to explain muscle activation patterns, thus the term motor abundance. In this work, we introduce some simple heuristics to empirically define the unknown goal space, and learn the IK of a 10 DoF musculoskeletal robot arm using directed goal babbling. We then further propose local online motor babbling guided by Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which bootstraps on the goal babbling samples for initialization, such that motor abundance can be queried online for any static goal. Our approach leverages the resolving of redundancies and the efficient guided exploration of motor abundance in two stages of learning, allowing both kinematic accuracy and motor variability at the queried goal. The result shows that local online motor babbling guided by CMA-ES can efficiently explore motor abundance at queried goal positions on a musculoskeletal robot system and gives useful insights in terms of muscle stiffness and synergy.",60031838,Kyushu Institute of Technology,Kitakyushu,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",30.142857142857142,0.11388888888888887,0.37817460317460316,1

The problem has been faced in many fields, from Signal Processing, Probabilistic Theory field, Topology field or Statistics field. Anyway, up to now, none of the trajectory similarity measurement metrics are invariant to all possible linear transformation of the trajectories (rotation, scaling, reflection, shear mapping or squeeze mapping). Also not all of them are robust in front of noisy signals or fast enough for real-time trajectory classification. To overcome this limitation this paper proposes a similarity distance metric that will remain invariant in front of any possible linear transformation. Based on Pearson's Correlation Coefficient and the Coefficient of Determination, our similarity metric, the Generalized Multiple Correlation Coefficient (GMCC) is presented like the natural extension of the Multiple Correlation Coefficient. The motivation of this paper is two-fold: First, to introduce a new correlation metric that presents the best properties to compute similarities between trajectories invariant to linear transformations and compare it with some state of the art similarity distances.

Specifically the ESKO 6d (EASE Stored Kitchen Objects with 6d poses) dataset features texture-less, glossy or glassy ordinary used objects which were naturally stored in a cupboard, drawer or dishwasher. There is a large degree of occlusion being the specific challenge in these scenes.

The dataset contains an RGB-D image or binocular RGB image plus stereo-matched depth image as well as 6d pose ground truth and instance segmentation. Our dataset contains twelve stored object scenes with a combined amount of 47 video sequences captured by each camera, resulting in over 17k annotated Kinect images and more than 42k annotated stereo images showing around 50 different objects.

1987,1987,Inertial-based Motion Capturing and Smart Training System,"Smart coaching platforms are emerging which combine Body-Sensor-Networks with AI-based training software to monitor and analyze body motions of athletes, workers, or medical patients. This allows for new opportunities to explore algorithms to interpret body sensor data and provide analytical feedback for learning a physical task, refining body motions, or to protect from work-related injuries. This paper presents a solution to non-invasively equip a person with sensors of a Smart Training System (STS) to improve training efficiency during sport activities. Our system calculates the significance of each body part during physical activities and provides targeted feedback on which body locations are under-performing. In experiments, the system collected data from 13 inertial sensors attached to the entire body of inexperienced golf learners. Using an indoor golf training net with a central target with 3 concentric zones, 1,080 real-world golf swings of 11 participants were analyzed. During the first 30 swings of each participant, the system learned distributions of motions from each sensor, conditioned on swing performance reported by users from their hitting location on the target. In the later 70 swings, feedback was provided to a subgroup of 8 participants, by computing, for an optimal set of features determined during training, the largest discrepancy.

1988,1988,Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of Reconfigurable Autonomous Robotic Boats: Roboats,"This paper presents a Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (LB-NMPC) algorithm for reconfigurable autonomous vessels to facilitate high-accurate path tracking. Each vessel is designed to latch to a pre-defined point of another vessel that allows the vessels to form a rigid body. The number of possible configurations of such vessels exponentially grows as the total number of vessels increases, which imposes a technical challenge in modeling and identification. In this work, we propose a framework consisting of a real-time parameter estimator and a feedback control strategy, which is capable of ensuring high-accurate path tracking for any feasible configuration of vessels. Novelty of our method is in that the parameter is estimated on-line and adjusts control parameters (e.g., cost function and dynamic model) simultaneously to improve path-tracking performance. Through experiments on different configurations of connected-vessels, we demonstrate stability of our proposed approach and its effectiveness in high-accuracy in path tracking.",60031004,University of Queensland,Brisbane,Australia,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.833333333333332,0.07500000000000001,0.5270833333333333,1

The soft systems benefit from their inherent compliance, which enables them to be used in applications that require safe interaction between humans and robots or manipulation in cluttered environment. Despite advancements in recent years research on soft material robots still needs to make progress in terms of modeling for model based control or path planning. The high nonlinearity of soft material robots makes efficient and accurate modeling difficult. In this work we introduce a kinematic modeling approach based on cubic hermite splines. The method is applied to a soft pneumatic actuator and evaluated against the widely used constant curvature approach. The hermite spline offers the possibility of accurate shape reconstruction from simulated or measured deformation data. Both the shape of a robot's segment and its orientation can be approximated this way.

In this scenario, the navigation system needs to continuously update and refine its feature map in order to adapt to the environment appearance change. To achieve reliable long-term navigation, the map management techniques have to (i) select features useful for the current navigation task, (ii) remove features that are obsolete, (iii) and add new features from the current camera view to the map. We propose several map management strategies and evaluate their performance with regard to the robot localisation accuracy in long-term teach-and-repeat navigation. Our experiments, performed over three months, indicate that strategies which model cyclic changes of the environment appearance and predict which features are going to be visible at a particular time and location, outperform strategies which do not explicitly model the temporal evolution of the changes.",60108693,Australian Centre for Robotic Vision,Brisbane,Australia,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",29.0,0.07537878787878788,0.2734848484848485,1

It outputs pixel-wise road detection results in both the LiDAR's imagery view and the camera's perspective view simultaneously, in an end-to-end manner. To make better use of the data associations between two representations, we construct a novel mapping layer to transform features from the LiDAR's imagery view to the camera's perspective view in order to strengthen the road detection performance in the camera's perspective view.

In traditional action recognition methods, RGB video-based ones are effective but computationally inefficient, while skeleton-based ones are computationally efficient but do not make use of low-level detail information. This work considers action recognition based on a multimodal fusion between the 3D skeleton and the RGB image. We design a neural network that uses a 3D skeleton sequence and a single middle frame from an RGB video as input. Specifically, our method picks up one frame in a video and extracts spatial features from it using two attention modules, a self-attention module and a skeleton-attention module. Further, temporal features are extracted from the skeleton sequence via a BI-LSTM sub-network. Finally, the spatial features and the temporal features are combined via a feature fusion network for action classification. A distinct feature of our method is that it uses only a single RGB frame rather than an RGB video. Accordingly, it has a light-weighted architecture and is more efficient than RGB video-based methods. Comparative evaluation on two public datasets, NTU-RGBD and SYSU, demonstrates that, our method can achieve competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.5,0.09732142857142857,0.384077380952381,1

This leads to the development of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). However, miniaturizing MAVs is very challenging because various problems still remain unsolved. Among those, miniaturizing actuator and rotor blade are the most common.

The main advantage of the constructed roadmap is its homotopy equivalence to the η-offset of the Cfree space. Though only used to plan paths as a regular roadmap in this work, because the roadmap preserves the topology of the underlying sampled space, the information can be used to plan paths beyond the simple connection of graph vertices. To construct the roadmap, we first sample the configuration space so that the resulting graph is a n-skeleton graph that constructs a Vietoris-Rips (VR) complex. Then, we perform a series of topological collapses to remove vertices from the graph while still preserving its topological properties. The resulting roadmaps are used to plan paths for different robots and the experimental results show that the proposed topological approach is faster and more feasible in complex high-dimensional spaces.",60011666,University at Albany,Albany,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.833333333333332,0.046085858585858584,0.40460650460650466,1

DeepVIO provides absolute trajectory estimation by directly merging 2D optical flow feature (OFF) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Specifically, it firstly estimates the depth and dense 3D point cloud of each scene by using stereo sequences, and then obtains 3D geometric constraints including 3D optical flow and 6-DoF pose as supervisory signals. Note that such 3D optical flow shows robustness and accuracy to dynamic objects and textureless environments. In DeepVIO training, 2D optical flow network is constrained by the projection of its corresponding 3D optical flow, and LSTM-style IMU preintegration network and the fusion network are learned by minimizing the loss functions from ego-motion constraints. Furthermore, we employ an IMU status update scheme to improve IMU pose estimation through updating the additional gyroscope and accelerometer bias. The experimental results on KITTI and EuRoC datasets show that DeepVIO outperforms state-of-the-art learning based methods in terms of accuracy and data adaptability.

A number of deep architectures with Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) were proposed that surpass the traditional machine learning approaches for segmentation by a large margin. These architectures predict the directly observable semantic category of each pixel by usually optimizing a cross-entropy loss. In this work we push the limit of semantic segmentation towards predicting semantic labels of directly visible as well as occluded objects or objects parts, where the network's input is a single depth image. We group the semantic categories into one background and multiple foreground object groups, and we propose a modification of the standard cross-entropy loss to cope with the settings. In our experiments we demonstrate that a CNN trained by minimizing the proposed loss is able to predict semantic categories for visible and occluded object parts without requiring to increase the network size (compared to a standard segmentation task).

To avoid mixing gravity and accelerometer bias, we propose to use the detected vertical edges to estimate a better gravity. This improves the observability to the underlying problem even without sufficient movement, so we can solve all the states crucial for a good initialization.

We thus propose the utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a powerful method to extract meaningful information without being misled by noisy data. We also introduce a self-supervised method that uses the physics of the sonar sensor to train the network on real data without ground-truth elevation maps.

Since then it has proven to be a powerful tool for easy trajectory programming, allowing lay-users to reprogram robots intuitively. Going beyond, a robot can learn tasks by user demonstrations through kinesthetic teaching, enabling robots to generalise tasks and further reducing the need for reprogramming. However, hand guidance is still mostly relegated to collaborative robots. Here we propose a method that does not require any sensors on the robot or in the robot cell, by using a Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality head mounted display. We reference the robot using a registration algorithm to match the robot model to the spatial mesh. The in-built hand tracking and localisation capabilities are then used to calculate the position of the hands relative to the robot. By decomposing the hand movements into orthogonal rotations and propagating it down through the kinematic chain, we achieve a generalised hand guidance without the need to build a dynamic model of the robot itself.

Particularly for drug delivery mechanisms, higher precision and the ability to follow complex trajectories in three dimensions (3D), has led to interest in flexible, steerable needles such as the programmable bevel-tip needle (PBN). Steering in 3D, however, holds practical challenges for surgeons, as interfaces are traditionally designed for straight line paths. This work presents a pilot study undertaken to evaluate a novel human-machine visual interface for the steering of a robotic PBN, where both qualitative evaluation of the interface and quantitative evaluation of the performance of the subjects in following a 3D path are measured.

Our approach has two key properties: (i) the ability to generalize and transfer manipulation skills (over the type, shape, and number of objects in the scene) using an abstract image-based representation that enables a neural network to learn useful features; and (ii) the ability to perform look-ahead planning in the image space using a physics simulator, which is essential for such multi-step problems.

In addition, we need to select which robot arm to perform the placement with. To solve this task, we propose an anytime algorithm that integrates sampling-based motion planning with a novel hierarchical search for suitable placement poses.

To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we propose a novel outdoor map-based localization method for Autonomous Vehicles in urban environments using sparse 3D lidar scan data. In the proposed method, a Point-to-Distribution (P2D) formulation of the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) approach is applied in a Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) framework. The formulation improves the measurement model of localization by taking individual lidar point measurements into consideration. Additionally, to apply the localization to scalable outdoor environments, a flexible and efficient map structure is implemented.

This domain, known as predictive uncertainty, has come under the scrutiny of research groups developing Bayesian approaches adapted to deep learning such as Monte Carlo Dropout. Unfortunately, for the time being, the real goal of predictive uncertainty has been swept under the rug. Indeed, these approaches are solely evaluated in terms of raw performance of the network prediction, while the quality of their estimated uncertainty is not assessed. Evaluating such uncertainty prediction quality is especially important in robotics, as actions shall depend on the confidence in perceived information. In this context, the main contribution of this article is to propose a novel metric that is adapted to the evaluation of relative uncertainty assessment and directly applicable to regression with deep neural networks.

This is partly due to the availability of high-quality render engines, which provide highly realistic synthetic images. However, the realism of the rendered images, and thus the reliability of the evaluations, strongly depends on how accurately the scenes are modeled and it requires considerable time and knowledge to do the modeling manually. Automating the modeling process is therefore crucial for making the rendering of photo-realistic synthetic images accessible to the wider robotics community. We present a method for automatically modeling object and light properties for rigid, opaque plastic objects commonly found in industry. Our method relies on recordings of the environment captured with a consumer 360^{\mathrm{o}} camera to model the light, and on analysis-by-synthesis to estimate the optical properties of the objects.

Our approach is a modification of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), a widely used framework for robot learning from demonstration. DMPs are based on dynamical systems to guarantee properties such as convergence to a goal state, robustness to perturbation, and the ability to generalize to other goal states. Yet a main limitation of their original formulation is that they do not allow for movements to be reversed. Thus, to execute the same task forwards and backwards would mean to learn two separate primitives. We propose to replace the transformation system in DMPs with the Logistic Differential Equation (LDE), a known time-reversible non-linear system. Similarly to the original DMP formulation, our system's temporal evolution is controlled by a phase system, which in our case is derived from the LDE to guarantee reversibility.

And then, a novel virtual stiffness model is proposed based on the analysis of human hip joint torque during walking and balance recovery. The virtual stiffness model is utilized to generate the desired active assistance torque profile for active walking and balance assistance. Next, the unified active assistance control framework is established based on the virtual stiffness model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control framework is demonstrated by walking experiments. The results of the forward walking experiment show that the muscle effort of iliopsoas is reduced and the amplitude of hip joint motion is enlarged with the assistance of hip exoskeleton. The walking forward pull experiments and the walking backward pull experiments show that when the human suffers from a forward or backward disturbance force during forward walking, exoskeleton can help human regain balance faster and can enlarge the margin of stability (MoS) of the human.",60102151,Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia,Genoa,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.875,-0.09999999999999999,0.41428571428571426,1

In the emerging area of aerial-aquatic vehicles, most existing prototypes rely on such systems to propel themselves in both air and water. As the density of water is three orders of magnitude larger than that of air, a spinning aerodynamic body in the medium will experience significantly higher torque at the same speed. This results in aerial propulsion systems to be heavily mismatched underwater, as the required torque is higher than the drive torque that a typical aerial motor can provide. Here, an in-depth investigation of such off-design operation is conducted. Based on numerical simulation, we identify the feasible operating range of such systems and present an evaluation framework that identifies a motor-propeller combination from a component database that maximises underwater performance while ensuring aerial thrust requirements are met.",60017161,National University of Singapore,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.333333333333332,0.10222222222222223,0.48833333333333334,1

The depth estimation problem aims at recovering the 3D information of the environment. The relative localization problem consists of estimating the relative pose between two robots, by sensing each other's pose or sharing information about the perceived environment. Most solutions for these problems use a set of discrete data without taking into account the chronological order of the events. This paper builds on recent results on continuous estimation to propose a framework that estimates the depth and relative pose between two non-holonomic vehicles. The basic idea consists in estimating the depth of the points by explicitly considering the dynamics of the camera mounted on a ground robot, and feeding the estimates of 3D points observed by both cameras in a filter that computes the relative pose between the robots.

2014,2014,A New Swarm-Based Simulated Annealing Hyper-Heuristic Algorithm for Clustering Problem," Published by Elsevier B.V.Hyper-heuristic is a new generation of heuristic algorithms which include a set of heuristics that could generate a set of heuristics or automate the process of selecting a batch of heuristics to address different optimization problems. Most of the heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms work in solution space and are highly problem-dependent and they are limited to use certain number of heuristic models only. Hyper-heuristic consists of two different sections, namely high-level heuristic and low level heuristics; to deal with optimization problems and work in heuristic spaces instead of solution spaces in selecting appropriate heuristics. In this article, we propose a new novel swarm-based simulated annealing hyper-heuristic model to solve clustering problem for analyzing data. The performance of proposed model has been evaluated by several benchmark and real data sets and compared with its state of the art in the literature. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provide better results than the alternative methods.",60090708,Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman,Kajang,Malaysia,['1700'],26.5,0.1583722943722944,0.45755844155844144,0
2015,2015,A Novel Robust Approach for Correspondence-Free Extrinsic Calibration,"Extrinsic calibration is a necessary step when using heterogeneous sensors for robotics applications. Most existing methods work under the assumption that the prior data correspondence is known. Considering data loss and false measurements, the correspondence may not be accessible in practice. To solve this problem without knowing the correspondence, several probabilistic methods have been proposed. However, an implicit restriction on input data limits their application. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a more stable correspondence-free method with two improvements that can relax the restrictions on inputs and improve the calibration accuracy. The first improvement finds consistent sets from raw inputs using screw invariants, which significantly improve the robustness in case of outliers and data loss. A new optimization method on matrix Lie group is proposed as the second improvement, which demonstrates better accuracy. The experimental results on both numerical and real data show the superiority and robustness of the proposed method.",60011373,Danmarks Tekniske Universitet,Lyngby,Denmark,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",16.77777777777778,0.15972465034965036,0.4093385780885781,1
2016,2016,Robust Outdoor Self-localization in Changing Environments,"In outdoor scenarios changing conditions (e.g., seasonal, weather and lighting effects) have a substantial impact on the appearance of a scene, which often prevents successful visual localization. The application of an unsupervised Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) on the images captured by an autonomous robot enables self-localization from a single image. However, changes occurring during the training phase or over a more extended period can affect the learned representations. To address the problem, we propose to join long-term recordings from an outdoor environment based on their position correspondences. The established hierarchical model trained on raw images performs well, but as an extension, we extract Fourier components of the views and use that for learning of spatial representations, which reduces the computation time and makes it adequate to run on an ARM embedded system. We present the experimental results from a simulated environment and real-world outdoor recordings collected over a full year, which has effects like different day time, weather, seasons and dynamic objects. Results show an increasing invariance w.r.t. changing conditions over time, thus an outdoor robot can improve its localization performance during operation.",60007762,Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main,Frankfurt am Main,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.875,0.14085657931811776,0.40583262890955196,1
2017,2017,Skill Interaction Categories for Communication in Flexible Human-Robot Teams,"Flexible human-robot cooperation can be coordinated by dynamic task allocation, where team members observe task progress and repeatedly decide to execute outstanding operations from a commonly known task model. Such task-level coordination strategies do not cover cases, where a high level of abstraction for task modelling implies operations infeasible for one single agent due to limited capabilities. Task-level coordination can handle these operations by introducing additional operation-level coordination for more fine-grained interaction, e.g. to hand over a tool or provide a helping hand. We contribute an approach to classify operations regarding the interaction they require. Based on this classification, we show how robots can plan and issue communication to coordinate respective interaction within dynamic plan execution.

The algorithm is used in conjunction with an existing multicopter trajectory generation method to achieve rapid, obstacle-aware motion planning in environments with both static convex obstacles and dynamic convex obstacles whose boundaries do not rotate. In general, this problem is difficult because the presence of convex obstacles makes the feasible space of trajectories nonconvex. The performance of the algorithm is benchmarked using Monte Carlo simulations, and experimental results are presented that demonstrate the use of the method to plan collision-free multicopter trajectories in milliseconds in environments with both static and dynamic obstacles.",60025038,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.0,0.0919799498746867,0.3949874686716792,1
2019,2019,Learning Event-based Height from Plane and Parallax,"Event-based cameras are a novel asynchronous sensing modality that provide exciting benefits, such as the ability to track fast moving objects with no motion blur and low latency, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. Given the low latency of the cameras, as well as their ability to work in challenging lighting conditions, these cameras are a natural fit for reactive problems such as fast local structure estimation. In this work, we propose a fast method to perform structure estimation for vehicles traveling in a roughly 2D environment (e.g. in an environment with a ground plane). Our method transfers the method of plane and parallax to events, which, given the homography to a ground plane and the pose of the camera, generates a warping of the events which removes the optical flow for events on the ground plane, while inducing flow for events above the ground plane. We then estimate dense flow in this warped space using a self-supervised neural network, which provides the height of all points in the scene. We evaluate our method on the Multi Vehicle Stereo Event Camera dataset, and show its ability to rapidly estimate the scene structure both at high speeds and in low lighting conditions.",60006297,University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.857142857142858,0.11157894736842106,0.439298245614035,1

In this paper, we solve the loop-closure detection problem by incorporating the deep-learning based point cloud description method and the coarse-to-fine sequence matching strategy. More specifically, we propose a deep neural network to extract a global descriptor from the original large-scale 3D point cloud, then based on which, a typical place analysis approach is presented to investigate the feature space distribution of the global descriptors and select several super keyframes. Finally, a coarse-to-fine strategy, which includes a super keyframe based coarse matching stage and a local sequence matching stage, is presented to ensure the loop-closure detection accuracy and real-time performance simultaneously. Thanks to the sequence matching operation, the proposed approach obtains an improvement against the existing deep-learning based methods.

LiDAR based systems have proven to be superior compared to vision based systems due to its accuracy and robustness. In spite of its superiority, pure LiDAR based systems fail in certain degenerate cases like traveling through a tunnel. We propose Stereo Visual Inertial LiDAR (VIL) SLAM that performs better on these degenerate cases and has comparable performance on all other cases. VIL-SLAM accomplishes this by incorporating tightly-coupled stereo visual inertial odometry (VIO) with LiDAR mapping and LiDAR enhanced visual loop closure. The system generates loop-closure corrected 6-DOF LiDAR poses in real-time and lcm voxel dense maps near real-time.

In the current work, we introduce a method for performance prediction and profiling of human activities. Using little information about a task, our method is able to extract the characteristic motion patterns of an agent, analyze them and predict his/her performance in a given activity.

Our methods do not need any prior information about a valve for the above-mentioned detection and estimation for grasping. In addition, our estimation for grasping provides useful information, by which WAREC-I can rotate a valve autonomously. The method (1) uses the RGB image and the point cloud data captured by Multisense SL as the input, and estimate the position and orientation of a valve far away from the robot. The method (2) uses both the RGB and depth images captured by KinectV2 as input and estimate information for grasping the valve. Our experiments are conducted using a real disaster response robot.

By separating vision-based control into a perception module and a controller module, we can train a DRL agent without sophisticated physics or 3D modeling. In addition, the modular framework averts daunting retrains of an image-to-action end-to-end neural network, and provides flexibility in transferring the controller to different robots. First, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately localize in an indoor setting with dynamic foreground/background. Then, we design a new DRL algorithm named Momentum Policy Gradient (MPG) for continuous control tasks and prove its convergence. We also show that MPG is robust at tracking varying leader movements and can naturally be extended to problems of formation control.

Collecting large amounts of hardware demonstration data is time-consuming and the exploratory behavior of reinforcement learning algorithms may lead the system into dangerous states, especially during the early stages of training. To address these challenges, we apply transfer learning to reuse a previously learned policy instead of learning from scratch. In this paper, we propose a method where given a source policy, policy adaptation is performed via transfer learning to produce a target policy suitable for real-world deployment. For policy adaptation, alignment-based transfer learning is applied to trajectories generated by the source policy and their corresponding safe target trajectories. We apply this method to manipulators and show that the proposed method is applicable to both inter-task and inter-robot transfer whilst considering safety. We also show that the resulting target policy is robust and can be further improved with reinforcement learning.",60013682,Seoul National University,Seoul,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.285714285714285,0.05976190476190477,0.5088095238095238,1

It requires the whole system to maintain steady contact with external environment, to track some predefined trajectories on surfaces, and simultaneously to present some fixed contact force. Aiming at this problem, a hybrid force/motion control framework is proposed in this paper. In this framework, contact force control and position control are performed separately in two orthogonal subspaces: constrained space and free-flight space. To control the contact force, the closed-loop unmanned aerial vehicle is first theoretically shown to behave dynamically as a spring-mass-damper system. Further, an inverse-dynamics-based controller is proposed. To control the moving along the contact surface, trajectory planning and position controller are combined to achieve the steady behavior in a free-flight subspace. In the end, an aerial manipulator system with a roller-type end-effector was designed, and practical flight experiments was performed. The results indicate that the proposed framework is effective and validity.",60021474,Shenyang Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences,Shenyang,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",17.22222222222222,0.1803030303030303,0.40303030303030307,1

The approach builds upon two components: 1) a robust detector that uses recurrent deep neural networks to dynamically detect a variety of situations of interest, such as zero velocity or no lateral slip; and 2) a state-of-the-art Kalman filter which incorporates this knowledge as pseudo-measurements for localization. Evaluations on a publicly available car dataset demonstrates that the proposed scheme may achieve a final distance error of 20 m for a 21 km long trajectory of a vehicle driving for over an hour, equipped with an IMU of moderate precision (the gyro drift rate is 10 deg/h). To our knowledge, this is the first paper which combines sophisticated deep learning techniques with state-of the-art filtering methods for pure inertial navigation on wheeled vehicles and as such opens up for novel data-driven inertial navigation techniques. Moreover, albeit taylored for IMU-only based localization, our method may be used as a component for self-localization of wheeled robots equipped with a more complete sensor suite.",60030506,Mines ParisTech,Paris,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",36.4,0.13673469387755102,0.5738095238095238,1

To enhance flexibility and application potentials, mecanum-wheeled platform is considered for the proposed multi-AGV system while the cooperative transportation is executed without physical link/gripper to fix the object on the AGVs. Therefore, the position and number of AGV is adjustable depending on the size and weight of the transported object. Analysis of force distribution to each AGV during cooperative transportation is presented. Furthermore, the gradient projection method is exploited to regulate internal force according to the operational capability of each AGV. Moreover, an adaptive sliding mode controller is designed for AGV to cope with dynamic uncertainty during cooperative transportation. Stability of the proposed controller is proven by using Lyapunov Theorem.

A False Negative Alarm System for Traffic Sign Detectors,"Object detection is an integral part of an autonomous vehicle for its safety-critical and navigational purposes. Traffic sign as an object plays a vital role in guiding such systems. However, if the vehicle fails to locate any critical sign, it might make a catastrophic failure. In this paper, we are proposing an approach to identify traffic signs that have been mistakenly discarded by the object detector. The proposed method raises an alarm when it discovers a failure by the object detector to detect a traffic sign. This approach can be useful to evaluate the performance of the detector during the deployment phase. We trained a single shot multi-box object detector to detect traffic signs and used its internal features to train a separate false negative detector (FND). During deployment, FND decides whether the traffic sign detector (TSD) has missed a sign or not. We are using precision and recall to measure the accuracy of FND in two different datasets. For 80% recall, FND has achieved 89.9% precision in Belgium Traffic Sign Detection dataset and 90.8% precision in German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to tackle this critical aspect of false negative detection in robotic vision.

In this paper, we present a methodology for on-line inference of human intention and prediction of human hand motion. The proposed framework is built using Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitive (PDMP). In the off-line stage, a set of PDMPs is constructed based on the recorded demonstrations and they will then be used for inferring human intention and predicting human hand motion in the on-line stage. A proof of concept evaluation is carried out in a tabletop manipulation task.

An innovative autofocusing visual feedback (AVF) method is proposed for precise three-dimensional (3D) locating of target cells. For depth detection, multiple depth from defocus (MDFD) method is adopted to solve symmetry problem and attain an average accuracy of 97.07%.

However, most aerial maps contain perspective projection distortions which can be significant in urban canyons with tall buildings. In this study, a new method to correct such projection distortion is proposed and it is applied to precise localization by fusing the corrected map and lidar data. In order to achieve this, the semantic segmentation of an aerial image is performed using a convolutional neural network, and the mutual information between the lidar measurements and the building boundaries is obtained to measure their similarity. A particle filter framework is employed to localize the vehicle and match the map using the mutual information as the weight of a particle.

While the interdisciplinary team did not set out to explore robot failures, failures played an ever-present role during the eighteen rehearsals and two live performances. This paper details strategies for addressing, planning for, and rehearsing responses to robot failures on stage, both technical and choreographic. In addition to scaffolding future robot theater performances, we discuss how these strategies apply to other customer- and audience-facing robots, including sponsor demos. The on-stage exploration of robot chairs and human performers also suggests that humans can conceptualize minimal robots as both characters and props, moving fluidly from one to the other.

Compared with passive compliance, active compliance has the advantages in terms of increasing the force transmission ability and improving safety with monitored force output. Previous studies have demonstrated that active compliance can be achieved based on a complex model of the mechanics combined with a traditional machine learning technique such as a support vector machine. This paper proposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) based approach that avoids the complexity of modeling while capturing nonlinear factors such as hysteresis, friction and delay of the electronics that are not easy to model.

A prominent approach to accomplish this is having robots to keep models of their actions based on their experiences in order to improve their action executions in the future. In this paper, we present such a methodology where robots start to execute some actions with random parameters and record their generic execution logs with semantic annotations in a symbolic knowledge base for robots.

Recent advances have demonstrated successful lane following behavior using deep reinforcement learning, yet the interactions with other vehicles on-road for lane changes are rarely considered. In this paper, we design a hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to learn lane change behaviors in dense traffic. By breaking down overall behavior to sub-policies, faster and safer lane change actions can be learned. We also apply temporal and spatial attention to the DRL architecture, which helps the vehicle focus more on surrounding vehicles and leads to smoother lane change behavior. We conduct our experiments in the TORCS simulator and the results outperform the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm in various lane change scenarios.",60104841,The Robotics Institute,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.0,0.1446296296296296,0.48425925925925933,1

This cost function is used as a penalty for a search-based motion planning method that discretizes both the control and the state space. We illustrate the methodology by showing that our approach can learn to imitate the airport arrival routes and separation rules of dense commercial air traffic.

The popular method of fusing depth information into a truncated signed distance function (TSDF) and applying the marching cubes algorithm for mesh extraction has severe issues with thin structures: not only does it lead to loss of accuracy, but it can generate completely wrong surfaces. To address this, we propose the directional TSDF - a novel representation that stores opposite surfaces separate from each other. The marching cubes algorithm is modified accordingly to retrieve a coherent mesh representation. We further increase the accuracy by using surface gradient-based ray casting for fusing new measurements. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art TSDF reconstruction algorithms in mesh accuracy.",60007493,Universität Bonn,Bonn,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.166666666666668,0.07779720279720279,0.6061188811188811,1

We want to fundamentally protect privacy by blurring unwanted blocks in images, such as faces, yet ensure that the robots can understand the video for their perception. In this paper, we propose a novel mobile robot framework with a deep learning-based privacy-preserving camera system. The proposed camera system detects privacy-sensitive blocks, i.e., human face, from extreme low resolution (LR) images, and then dynamically enhances the resolution of only privacy-insensitive blocks, e.g., backgrounds. Keeping all the face blocks to be extreme LR of 15x15 pixels, we can guarantee that human faces are never at high resolution (HR) in any of processing or memory, thus yielding strong privacy protection even from cracking or backdoors. Our camera system produces an image on a real-time basis, the human faces of which are in extreme LR while the backgrounds are in HR. We experimentally confirm that our proposed face detection camera system outperforms the state-of-the-art small face detection algorithm, while the robot performs ORB-SLAM2 well even with videos of extreme LR faces. Therefore, with the proposed system, we do not too much sacrifice robot perception performance to protect privacy.",60103153,Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology,Ulsan,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.125,0.04486772486772487,0.5703439153439153,1

In this paper, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to develop an Autonomous Traffic and Road Sign (ATRS) detection and recognition system. The proposed system works in real time detecting and recognizing traffic sign images. The contribution of this paper is also a newly developed database of 24 different traffic signs collected from random road sides in Saudi Arabia. The images were taken from different angles and including other parameters and conditions. A total of 2718 images were collected to form the database which we named Saudi Arabian Traffic and Road Signs (SA-TRS-2018).

2047,2047,Maximum Likelihood Path Planning for Fast Aerial Maneuvers and Collision Avoidance,"We propose a planning method to enable fast autonomous flight in cluttered environments. Typically, autonomous navigation through a complex environment requires a continuous search on a graph generated by a k-connected grid or a probabilistic scheme. As the vehicle travels, updating the graph with data from onboard sensors is expensive as is the search on the graph especially if the paths must be kinodynamically feasible. We propose to avoid the online search to reduce the computational complexity. Our method models the environment differently in two separate regions. Obstacles are considered to be deterministically known within the sensor range and probabilistically known beyond the sensor range. Instead of searching for the path with the lowest cost (typically the shortest path), the method maximizes the likelihood to reach the goal in determining the immediate next step for navigation. With such a problem formulation, the online method realized by a trajectory library can determine a path within 0.2-0.3ms using a single CPU thread on a modem embedded computer. In experiments, it enables a lightweight UAV to fly at 10m/s in a cluttered forest environment (see Fig. 1 as an example).",60114176,"Near Earth Autonomy, Inc.",Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",18.7,0.05476190476190476,0.5241758241758242,1

A robotic manipulator is used to provide the required degrees of freedom to the mounted wheel or subsystem, making it necessary to actively control the interaction force of the wheel-soil contact. This paper is concerned with the development of a feasible force control strategy for the testbench wheel-soil contact during single-wheel experiments. For this purpose, a terramechanical model has been developed to accurately map the dynamic processes relevant for the force control design, which is later used in a testbench simulation framework to predict and evaluate the performance of control strategies. The Adaptive Admittance Control (AAC) scheme developed is adapting the gain based on the current control deviation, the rotational velocity of the wheel and an estimated soil stiffness during the experiment. The AAC is evaluated using a benchmark single-wheel experiment and shows superior performance compared to standard admittance control.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.333333333333332,0.09777777777777778,0.3866666666666667,1

However the intrinsic nonlinearity of the SLIP dynamics makes accurate analytical representation unavailable. Traditional methods take advantage of numerical integration to handle this issue while several existing analytical approximations focusing on 2D-SLIP model. The 3D-SLIP suitable to physical reality is rarely investigated. This paper presents a novel perturbation-based approach to obtain the closed-form analytical approximations of the 3D-SLIP model in stance phase. In contrast to existing work ignoring the gravitational forces, the proposed approach just relies on assumptions of small leg compression and small leg swept angle. The performance of the derived approximations has been evaluated via comprehensive numerical analysis.

However, the direct implementation of this optimization requires different sets of variables to express different active contact constraints, which can be complicated to implement. To simplify the optimization formulation, we propose the generalized contact constraints where the same set of variables are used through all the walking phases. By changing the variable and constraint bounds, different contact constraints for different contact conditions can be generally expressed. The proposed modifications are applied on the bipedal robot AMBER 3, where the optimization results on different terrains are compared and discussed. On the other hand, it is known that a randomized initial guess can be used to solve this optimization, yet its effect on the gaits on different terrains is unclear. As a result, we analyzed the sensitivity of the optimization to a set of randomized initial guesses. The level and downslope walking gaits are also validated via the experiments on AMBER 3.",60020547,Texas A&amp;M University,College Station,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.0,0.049537037037037046,0.46759259259259256,1

In this paper, we present a new autonomy system (Roboat) for urban waterways which requires robust localization, perception, planning, and control. A novel localization system, based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), is proposed for USVs, which utilizes LiDAR, camera, and IMU to provide a decimeter-level precision in dynamic GPS-attenuated urban waterways. Area and shape filters are proposed to crop water reflections and street obstacles from a pointcloud. Euclidean clustering and multi-object contour tracking are then introduced to detect and track the static and moving objects reliably in urban waters. An efficient path planner is tailored to calculate optimal trajectories to avoid these static and dynamic obstacles. Lastly, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme with full state integration is formulated for the four-control-input robot to accurately track the trajectory from the planner in rough water. Extensive experiments show that the robot is able to autonomously navigate in both the indoor waterway and the cluttered outdoor waterway in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles, implying that Roboat could have a great impact on the future of transportation in many coastal and riverside cities.",60022195,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.5,0.1603729603729604,0.35914918414918423,1

A trimming planning method considers the available degrees of freedom of the robot arm to achieve effective cutting motions.

Previous demonstrations on flying robots have required search times in excess of ten minutes, or required computation-intensive signal processing, largely because of the slow response of semiconductor gas sensors. To mitigate these limitations, we developed a hybrid biological/synthetic chemical sensing platform consisting of a moth antenna on an aerial robot. We demonstrate that our robot, a 9 centimeter nano drone, can repeatedly detect and reach the source of a volatile organic chemical plume in less than a minute. We also introduce wind vanes to passively aim the robot upwind, greatly simplifying control. To our knowledge this is the first odor-finding robot to use this approach, and it allows for localization using feedback only from sensors carried on-board rather than GPS, allowing indoor operation. The chemical sensor consists of a hybrid biological/synthetic integrated chemical sensor (electroantennogram) using an excised antenna of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta and associated miniaturized electrophysiology conditioning circuitry.

However, in certain task-related scenarios, this requirement might conflict with the need for robots to spread out in the environment, e.g., for distributed sensing or surveillance applications. This paper demonstrates how a swarm of minimally-equipped robots can form high-density robot aggregates that coexist with lower robot densities in space. We envision a scenario where a swarm of vibration-driven robots - which sit atop bristles and achieve directed motion by vibrating them - move randomly in an environment while colliding with each other. Theoretical techniques from the study of far-from-equilibrium collectives and statistical mechanics clarify the mechanisms underlying the formation of these high and low density regions. Specifically, we capitalize on a transformation that connects the collective properties of a system of self-propelled particles with that of a well-studied molecular fluid system, thereby inheriting the rich theory of equilibrium thermodynamics. Real robot experiments as well as simulations illustrate how inter-robot collisions can precipitate the formation of non-uniform robot densities in a closed and bounded region.",60020547,Texas A&amp;M University,College Station,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.714285714285715,0.037252747252747256,0.36302197802197794,1
2056,2056,Region-wise Polynomial Regression for 3D Mobile Gaze Estimation,"In the context of mobile gaze tracking techniques, a 3D gaze point can be calculated as the middle point between two 3D visual axes. To infer gaze directions and eyeball positions, a nonlinear optimization problem is typically formulated to minimize the angular disparities between the training gaze directions and prediction ones. Nonetheless, the experimental results reported by some previous works show that this kind of approaches are very likely to yield large prediction errors hence considered less useful for human-machine interactions. In this study, we aim to address this widespread issue in three aspects. At first, instead of using a global regression model, a simple local polynomial model is proposed to back-project a pupil center onto its corresponding visual axis. Based on the Leave-One-Out cross-validation criterion, the partition structure is automatically learned in the process of resolving a homography-like relationship. Secondly, a good starting point for nonlinear-optimization is obtained by the image eyeball center, which can be estimated by systematic parallax errors. Meanwhile, it is necessary to add the suitable constraints for 3D eye positions. Otherwise, the optimization may end up with trivial solutions, i.e., faraway eye positions. Thirdly, we explore a strategy for designing the spatial distribution of calibration points in a principled manner.

2057,2057,Influence of parameters uncertainties on the positioning of cable-driven parallel robots,"Positioning accuracy of cable-driven parallel robots is influenced by many factors such as geometry, actuator sensor accuracy and disturbances in the applied wrench. Another uncertainty source is the elasticity of the cables. While the influence of many factors may be decreased by calibration and/or sensor fusion, elasticity parameters are difficult to estimate and their effect on the positioning errors has yet to be determined. In this paper we consider a generic cable model that includes cable elasticity and the effect of cable weight and we propose a generic algorithm that allows one to safely calculate the minimum and maximum of the positioning error at a given pose when the elasticity parameters are constrained to lie within some given bounds. The algorithm is designed for being able to manage the effect of different uncertainties sources and we compare the influence of elasticity versus the effect of uncertainties in the cable lengths.",60013373,INRIA Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique,Le Chesnay,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",30.0,0.1,0.4477272727272727,1

Using the model entails viewing the effect of applied expression modalities in light of how well the robot responds to external stimuli and with attention to how aligned the robot's means of affective expressions are with the intended working scenario. The model-based survey shows that a majority (85%) of the surveyed robots contain a category with room for additional affective means of expression, and a quarter (25.6%) of the robots use a single or two affective expression modalities to convey affective states.

These are triggered only if and when needed to reduce the positioning uncertainty, itself modeled by a probabilistic cost function.

Although most state-of-the-art methods exploit simple primitives such as points or lines, and thus require dense scene models, the emergence of very effective CNN-based object detectors in the recent years have paved the way to the use of much lighter 3D models composed solely of a few semantically relevant features. In that context, we propose a novel model-based camera pose estimation method in which the scene is modeled by a set of virtual ellipsoids. We show that 6-DoF camera pose can be determined by optimizing only the three orientation parameters, and that at least two correspondences between 3D ellipsoids and their 2D projections are necessary in practice.

We aim to address disaster situations in which prior knowledge of a place is available from CAD or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) maps, but incoming visibility is severely limited. In smoky environments, typical sensors (e.g., cameras and LiDARs) fail to perform reliably due to the large particles in the air. Radars recently attracted attention for their robust perception in low-visibility environments; however, radar measurements' angular ambiguity and low resolution prevented the direct application to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework. In this paper, we propose registering radar measurements against a previously built dense LiDAR map for localization and applying radar-map refinement for mapping.

Unlike other unsupervised methods, it produces depth estimations with absolute scale - a feature that is essential for most practical applications, yet has mostly been overlooked in the literature. First, we show how our method allows adapting a network trained on one dataset (Cityscapes) to another (KITTI). Next, by splitting KITTI in subsets, we show the sensitivity of pretrained models to a domain shift.

It has the potential to achieve automated nano-robotic tasks such as nano-handling and nano-assembly. Path following control of nano-robot end effectors using SEM vision feedback is a key for an intuitive programming of elementary robotic tasks sequences. It requires the ability to track end effectors under various SEM scan speeds. SEM suffers however from tricky issues that limits robotic tracking capabilities. This paper focuses on one specific issue related to the compromise between the scan speed and the image quality. This restriction seriously limits the performance of conventional vision tracking algorithms when used with electron images. At high scan speed, the image quality is very noisy making very difficult to differentiate the robot end effector from the background, hence limiting the tracking capabilities. The work related in this paper explores for the first time the potential value of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet) in the context of nano-robotic vision tracking inside SEM. The aim is to localize an end-effector, AFM cantilever in the case of the study, from SEM images for any scan speed configuration and despite of low images quality. For that purpose, a data set of AFM tip images is build up from SEM images for the learning algorithm. Network performances are estimated under different SEM scan speeds.

2066,2066,Effects of a Bio-mimicked Flapping Path on Propulsion Efficiency of Two-segmental Fish Robots,"Having an appropriate flapping path to yield efficient propulsion is an interesting issue in fish robotics. In most works, especially two-segmental structures, the flapping motion is limited to sinusoidal functions. In this paper, to cope with the aforementioned limitation, a conceptual non-sinusoidal path is proposed. The proposed flapping path and the conventional one, both are optimized for a sample fish robot.

Experiments are performed on a Baxter robot with a four-microphone planar array mounted on its head. Results show that this method offers similar robustness to noise as the state-of-the-art Multiple Signal Classification based on Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD-MUSIC) method, and considerably reduces the computational load by a factor of 250.

DAgger is an iterative algorithm that addresses these issues by aggregating training data from both the expert and novice policies, but does not consider the impact of safety. We present a probabilistic extension to DAgger, which attempts to quantity the confidence of the novice policy as a proxy for safety. Our method, EnsembleDAgger, approximates a Gaussian Process using an ensemble of neural networks. Using the variance as a measure of confidence, we compute a decision rule that captures how much we doubt the novice, thus determining when it is safe to allow the novice to act. With this approach, we aim to maximize the novice's share of actions, while constraining the probability of failure. We demonstrate improved safety and learning performance compared to other DAgger variants and classic imitation learning on an inverted pendulum and in the MuJoCo HalfCheetah environment.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.571428571428573,-0.04907407407407406,0.2490740740740741,1

A complexly constrained, and reconfigurable object, such as a Rubik's cube, is hard to describe its physical motion constraints, mainly because they are determined by the grasping situation and dynamically changeable. Rather than describing the physical motion constraints in a general form, we more focus on the multiple hand interaction of a complex object. A complex object is divided into multiple subparts which are grasped by each hand, and the constraints between the subparts are optimized for inducing natural and continuous movement. For this, we propose a dynamically adjustable data structure for representing object parts grasped by multiple hands, and an optimization-based pose estimation of the constrained subparts along with their grasped hands. The experiments show that human subjects can manipulate a complexly constrained object such as a Rubik's cube without any difficulty as if it exists in the real-world.",60032144,Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology,Yusong,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.0,-0.0369047619047619,0.28384353741496604,1

Point clouds can be generated intra-operatively via endoscopic instruments, enabling the system to update obstacle representations over time as the patient anatomy changes during surgery. Our new motion planning method uses a combination of sampling-based motion planning methods and local optimization to efficiently handle point cloud data and quickly compute high quality plans. The local optimization step uses an interior point optimization method, ensuring that the computed plan is feasible and avoids obstacles at every iteration. This enables the motion planner to run in an anytime fashion, i.e., the method can be stopped at any time and the best solution found up until that point is returned. We demonstrate the method's efficacy in three anatomical scenarios, including two generated from endoscopic videos of real patient anatomy.",60025111,The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,Chapel Hill,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",26.333333333333332,0.17296969696969697,0.20945454545454548,1

We build an energy network model, with which we can monitor the energy flow through the system and prescribe a threshold on stored energy. We also develop an adaptive motion control law that shapes the desired trajectory in order to respect the stored energy threshold. Next, we show how adapting the stored energy threshold can be used to change the level of responsiveness to the patient as well as to prevent excessive energy transfer to the human by the system. A criterion is defined for setting this energy threshold, which can be further used for monitoring the patient active participation and for adapting and learning the appropriate assistance level during rehabilitation. Experimental results based on implementation in MATLAB Simscape® and on the VEMO robotic system demonstrate the feasibility of the suggested approach.

Therefore, having torque or angle speed outside of the predicted range will usually cause the task to fail. In this research, we propose a joint module with a two-stage transmission mechanism during driving and a joint locking mechanism during non-driving so that the appropriate torque and joint speed can be attained during the task.

The diagnostic process extremely involves the image visual perception. Unfortunately, the possibility of error existence in perception is not acceptable as it mainly affects the patients' lives. Image enhancement improves the visual quality of image, helps the clinician in his decision and thus saves the patients' lives. Histogram is a common tool for improving contrast in medical imaging. It recovers the lost contrast by redistributing the image brightness values that unfortunately may generate undesirable artifacts. Therefore, researchers developed the histogram-based algorithms to overcome this problem. This paper presents a comprehensive study of many histogram-based algorithms. We utilized the powerful MATLAB package to analyze the enhancement performance of these histogram-based algorithms. Moreover, this paper quantitatively compares the results and thus evaluates their performance by three metric parameters, which are the mean square error, standard deviation, and the peak signal to noise ratio.",60107224,"Effat University, Saudi Arabia",Jeddah,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],16.1,0.01861111111111112,0.5380555555555555,0
2074,2074,Online Optimal Impedance Planning for Legged Robots,"Real world applications require robots to operate in unstructured environments. This kind of scenarios may lead to unexpected environmental contacts or undesired interactions, which may harm people or impair the robot. Adjusting the behavior of the system through impedance control techniques is an effective solution to these problems. However, selecting an adequate impedance is not a straightforward process. Normally, robot users manually tune the controller gains with trial and error methods. This approach is generally slow and requires practice. Moreover, complex tasks may require different impedance during different phases of the task. This paper introduces an optimization algorithm for online planning of the Cartesian robot impedance to adapt to changes in the task, robot configuration, expected disturbances, external environment and desired performance, without employing any direct force measurements. We provide an analytical solution leveraging the mass-spring-damper behavior that is conferred to the robot body by the Cartesian impedance controller. Stability during gains variation is also guaranteed. The effectiveness of the method is experimentally validated on the quadrupedal robot ANYmal.

One of the natural characteristics of the human arm of utmost importance in our interaction with the environment is our ability to vary the mechanical impedance of our joints by commanding the co-contraction of antagonist muscles. Integration in prostheses of such features is currently under studies. The introduction of physical variable impedance in the mechatronic structure of the devices could at the same time improve interaction and robustness and allow for more sophisticated controls with the goal of naturalness of motion. The system proposed in this paper is a variable stiffness elbow joint for upper limb prostheses that reproduces mechanical abilities of the human joint, in terms of performance, inherent compliance and natural behaviour. This variable stiffness mechanism can be actively controlled by the user, and by using an agonist-antagonistic configuration of proper elastic elements, its output functions are similar to the models of the human muscle.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of our approach over filtering methods (which are customarily applied in the target setting) with minimal impact to computational efficiency.

The precancerous stage for detection can be determine by screening test, known Pap smear test for avoiding occurrence of cervical cancer. The problem face in the test is the human error in reading the data analysis and also lack number of pathologists to interpret the data analysis. Creating a computer-aided diagnosis system is one of the solutions that can interpret the data. Most of the research available used artificial neural network for diagnosis system to classify the cervical cancer cells data into normal and abnormal. This research creates a neural network (NN) using Hybrid Multi-layered Perceptron (HMLP) trained by Genetic Algorithm (GA) to diagnose the data. The data is extracted from cervical cells and divided into four features as the input, which are size of nucleus, size of cytoplasm, grey level of nucleus, and grey level of cytoplasm. The data is interpreted into three categories; are normal, Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) and High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL). These categories will be inserted in to the algorithm to calculate and determined the neural network performance. The data is randomly separated into dataset using 5-fold cross validation technique. The performance is compared with Hybrid Radial Basis Function (HRBF) trained with Adaptive Fuzzy K-means and Moving K-means Clustering Algorithm.

2081,2081,Combining spiking motor primitives with a behaviour-based architecture to model locomotion for six-legged robots,"Bio-inspired robots take advantage of millions of years of evolution to provide interesting and flexible solutions for issues related to motion and perception. Often, they have challenging kinematics classical robotics control mechanisms are not always able to take advantage of them. A concrete example of this is LAURON V, a six-legged robot for space exploration inspired by the stick insects. The main goals of this work is to combine classical behaviour-based control with motor primitives implemented with SNN for motion representation. We extend a previously presented bio-inspired approach to represent hand and arm motion using motor primitives, and combine it with a behaviour-based architecture to model different locomotion behaviours for a multi-legged robot. There are four main components. First, to model the individual leg motions we use two motor primitives implemented with spiking neural networks for the swing and stance phases. Second, to control the motor primitives of each leg there are local behaviours corresponding to each phase, and corresponding to each activation pattern. Third, the activation patterns are used to facilitate multi-leg coordination and generate different walking behaviours. Fourth, a high-level control interface integrates control signals from other sources and activates the patterns. We conducted five different experiments to evaluate our approach in a simulated environment using the Neurorobotics Platform (NRP). The results show that our modelling approach with motor primitives is flexible enough to represent different types of motions, and also highlight the value of the NRP for robotics development.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.166666666666668,0.08825757575757574,0.34848484848484845,1

2083,2083,Design of a New Automated Fault Detector based on artificial intelligence and Big Data Techniques," Published by Elsevier B.V.Concerns over energy and environmental issues around the world have led to the worldwide focus on energy use reduction. Studies in each area of energy have shown that residential and commercial construction sectors consume more power than other sectors such as industry, agriculture, services, and transportation. Studies of energy consumption in building sectors have reported that energy savings of 10% to 30% can be obtained by using artificial intelligence (AI), the system would be capable of detecting and analyzing anomalies in energy usage pattern assessing, diagnosing and suggesting the best solution in suitable time. This paper proposes to integrate and hybridize between AI techniques and big data algorithms which can enhance monitoring and controlling building systems, increasing comfort and decreasing efficiently the running costs. In addition, the authors suggest a tool which aims to automatically detect abnormal energy consumption by using AI and big data which are produced by the Building Management System (BMS). This happens by designing a software application that is called Fault Detection Tool (FDT) which automatically detects the abnormalities of energy consumption, optimizes the use of different resources and analyzes faults, complaints and time taken to terminate them.

2084,2084,Hysteresis Compensator with Learning-based Pose Estimation for a Flexible Endoscopic Surgery Robot,"The use of the tendon-sheath mechanism (TSM) is common in flexible surgery robots, because it can flexibly work in limited spaces and provides efficient power transmission. However, hysteresis from nonlinearities such as friction and backlash poses a challenge in controlling precise motion in the surgical instrument. Moreover, this hysteresis is also affected by changes in the various configurations of sheath which limits traditional model-based compensation approaches. Recently, feedback approach using an endoscopic camera is presented, but they use markers which are not appropriate for applying to a real surgical instruments. In this paper, a novel hysteresis compensator with learning-based pose estimation is proposed. Unlike previous studies, the proposed compensator can reduce hysteresis of the surgical instrument in various sheath configurations without using markers. In order to estimate an actual angle of the surgical instrument's joint, we employ the learning-based pose estimation using a siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN). The proposed compensator reduces hysteresis by partially controlling the position command, similar to the instinctive adjustments that physicians make with their visual feedback. To validate the proposed method, a testbed was constructed considering several requirements of flexible surgery robots. As a result, the results show the proposed method reduces hysteresis to less than 10°, for various configurations of sheath. In addition, we confirmed that the learning-based pose estimation is sufficient to apply to the proposed compensator for reducing hysteresis in real-time.",60032144,Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology,Yusong,South Korea,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.818181818181817,-0.002882205513784457,0.3829573934837093,1
2085,2085,Using Data Mining Techniques to Guide Academic Programs Design and Assessment," Published by Elsevier B.V.This paper presents a novel application of data mining techniques to guide academic programs design and assessment. More specifically, it propose using association rule mining techniques to discover a set of rules that govern the relationship between two core components of an academic program, program educational objectives (PEOs) and students outcomes(SOs). As a case study, this paper demonstrates how association rule mining techniques are applied to mine mapping rules between the PEOs and a predefined set of SOs adopted by the American Board for Engineering and Technology-Engineering Accreditation Commission (ABET-EAC) for engineering programs. To this end, a set of 152 ABET-EAC accredited engineering programs' self-study reports have been collected and the mapping data between their PEOs and ABET-EAC SOs have been extracted. This dataset has been pre-processed and transformed into a representation suitable for applying association rule mining techniques. This involves identifying a set of PEOs labels, annotating data instances with PEOs labels, and projecting each multi-label data instance into a set of single-label instances. Apriopi algorithm is then applied to discover the rules that govern the mapping between PEOs and ABET-EAC SOs. The discovered rules are of particular importance for guiding the design and assessment of engineering academic programs.

In this control approach, during the movement of a team of robots through an unknown occluded environment, a virtual boundary for the robotic crowd that could pass through even a very narrow passage, as a swarm, has been created based on the agents' /robots' sensing information. The primary challenge is to force each and every agent to fit into the arbitrary boundary, thus created, so that they can form a swarm and eventually progress towards the goal while avoiding obstacles. Consequently, the process maximizes the inter-agent cohesion. Furthermore, the virtual region is subdivided into so-called cells designated by a non-overlapping circular geometry. The utmost endeavor is to make an agent place itself at the center of a circular cell and a mechanism has been devised, where each agent is duly attracted and eventually is resident at the center of each cell completely blanketing the entire virtual region. To place each agent inside the stipulated contour, a novel circle-packing algorithm has been proposed such that the contour is fitted with a number of identical circles.

However, in many real-world settings, the uncertainties of the environment, the safety requirements and generalized capabilities that are expected of robots make rigid industrial robots unsuitable. This created great research interest in developing control strategies for flexible robot hardware for which building dynamical models are challenging. In this paper, inspired by the success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we systematically study the efficacy of policy search methods using DRL in training flexible robots. Our results indicate that DRL is successfully able to learn efficient and robust policies for complex tasks at various degrees of flexibility.

The experimental design includes both Human-Human and Human-Robot trials. The Human-Human trials serve as a baseline condition and help assessing the importance of the partner's nature (human vs robot) knowledge in the subjects behavior. The Human-Robot trials are used to observe the effect of different tuning of the Virtual Partner on the dominance relationship within Human-Robot dyads. The results of the study show that Human behavior is consistent across Human-Human trials, and is not influenced by the knowledge of their partner's nature. Moreover, a simple tuning of the negotiation thresholds of the Virtual Partner allows to significantly modify the dominance of the human partner, although this modification has no lasting effects.",60001422,Sorbonne Universite,Paris,France,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",23.0,0.09722222222222224,0.2965873015873016,1
2091,2091,Representing Robot Task Plans as Robust Logical-Dynamical Systems,"It is difficult to create robust, reusable, and reactive behaviors for robots that can be easily extended and combined. Frameworks such as Behavior Trees are flexible but difficult to characterize, especially when designing reactions and recovery behaviors to consistently converge to a desired goal condition. We propose a framework which we call Robust Logical-Dynamical Systems (RLDS), which combines the advantages of task representations like behavior trees with theoretical guarantees on performance. RLDS can also be constructed automatically from simple sequential task plans and will still achieve robust, reactive behavior in dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we describe both our proposed framework and a case study on a simple household manipulation task, with examples for how specific pieces can be implemented to achieve robust behavior. Finally, we show how in the context of these manipulation tasks, a combination of an RLDS with planning can achieve better results under adversarial conditions.",60076695,NVIDIA,Santa Clara,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",25.0,0.014102564102564105,0.5530219780219781,1
2092,2092,A 3D Static Modeling Method and Experimental Verification of Continuum Robots Based on Pseudo-Rigid Body Theory,"Continuum robots composed of elastic backbones have a broad application prospect in the narrow and restricted environment because they overcome the disadvantages of traditional articulated robots, such as being bulky and inflexible. Statics plays an important role in the planning and control of the continuum robot composed of the elastic backbone. Pseudo-Rigid Body (PRB) theory has shown great potential in the description of flexible body statics. The PRB 3R model accurately describes the large deformation of the flexible body and has high computational efficiency. However, PRB 3R models mostly focus on the planar static modeling, and there are few applications in three-dimensional (3D) statics. In this paper, a 3D static modeling method of cable-driven continuum robot based on PRB 3R theory is proposed. By introducing the equilibrium constraint equations of resultant force/moment and bending plane normal of the elastic backbone, the state of the continuum robot is determined. The 3D static equations established by the proposed method take into account the comprehensive effects of the elastic force, external force, gravity and friction. A static verification experiment system of the cable-driven continuum robot is designed to verify the proposed method. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by comparison with experimental data. The maximum position error between simulation and experimental results is 7.6%.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.363636363636363,0.19460884353741495,0.6030668934240364,1
2093,2093,Boundary Effect-Aware Visual Tracking for UAV with Online Enhanced Background Learning and Multi-Frame Consensus Verification,"Due to implicitly introduced periodic shifting of limited searching area, visual object tracking using correlation filters often has to confront undesired boundary effect. As boundary effect severely degrade the quality of object model, it has made it a challenging task for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to perform robust and accurate object following. Traditional hand-crafted features are also not precise and robust enough to describe the object in the viewing point of UAV. In this work, a novel tracker with online enhanced background learning is specifically proposed to tackle boundary effects. Real background samples are densely extracted to learn as well as update correlation filters. Spatial penalization is introduced to offset the noise introduced by exceedingly more background information so that a more accurate appearance model can be established. Meanwhile, convolutional features are extracted to provide a more comprehensive representation of the object. In order to mitigate changes of objects' appearances, multi-frame technique is applied to learn an ideal response map and verify the generated one in each frame. Exhaustive experiments were conducted on 100 challenging UAV image sequences and the proposed tracker has achieved state-of-the-art performance.",60073652,Tongji University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.666666666666668,0.25022321428571426,0.5459077380952382,1
2094,2094,Learning Virtual Borders through Semantic Scene Understanding and Augmented Reality,"Virtual borders are an opportunity to allow users the interactive restriction of their mobile robots' workspaces, e.g. to avoid navigation errors or to exclude certain areas from working. Currently, works in this field have focused on human-robot interaction (HRI) methods to restrict the workspace. However, recent trends towards smart environments and the tremendous progress in semantic scene understanding give new opportunities to enhance the HRI-based methods. Therefore, we propose a novel learning and support system (LSS) to support users during teaching of virtual borders. Our LSS learns from user interactions employing methods from visual scene understanding and supports users through recommendations for interactions. The bidirectional interaction between the user and system is realized using augmented reality. A validation of the approach shows that the LSS robustly recognizes a limited set of typical areas for virtual borders based on previous user interactions (F 1 - Score= 91.5%) while preserving the high accuracy of standard HRI-based methods with a median of Mdn= 84.6%. Moreover, this approach allows the reduction of the interaction time to a constant mean value of M =2 seconds making it independent of the border length. This avoids a linear interaction time of standard HRI-based methods.",60018362,Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg,Magdeburg,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.7,0.02131290584415585,0.36338676948051946,1

For this purpose AUVs can be used, with e.g. the task of inspecting pipelines. The article describes the processing algorithm for the signal from passive ferromagnetic (fluxgate) sensors mounted on an AUV carrier used to search for metal-containing objects at the sea bottom. A scheme for such a measurement is proposed - The installation of two sensors at the opposite ends of the carrier. This allows to measure the gradient of magnetic field between the sensors. The characteristic form of such a signal and the dependence of the signal on the motion parameters of the vehicle and external factors are determined. To eliminate false positives, filters are used based on the readings of the position, speed and orientation sensors of the navigation system. Using data on the motion parameters of the device allows to generate a reference signal, which is used to validate the detection of an object using the cross-correlation method. The use of data on orientation angles makes it possible to compensate for the influence of the orientation of the device in the Earths magnetic field.",60075338,Russian State Scientific Center for Robotics and Technical Cybernetics,Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.8,-0.02,0.45666666666666667,1
2096,2096,Task-oriented Grasping in Object Stacking Scenes with CRF-based Semantic Model,"In task-oriented grasping, the robot is supposed to manipulate the objects in a task-compatible manner, which is more important but more challenging than just stably grasping. However, most of existing works perform task-oriented grasping only in single object scenes. This greatly limits their practical application in real world scenes, in which there are usually multiple stacked objects with serious overlaps and occlusions. To perform task-oriented grasping in object stacking scenes, in this paper, we firstly build a synthetic dataset named Object Stacking Grasping Dataset (OSGD) for task-oriented grasping in object stacking scenes. Secondly, a Conditional Random Field (CRF) is constructed to model the semantic contents in object regions. The modelled semantic contents can be illustrated as incompatibility of task labels and continuity of task regions. This proposed approach can greatly reduce the interference of overlaps and occlusions in object stacking scenes. To embed the CRF-based semantic model into our grasp detection network, we implement the inference process of CRFs as a RNN so that the whole model, Task-oriented Grasping CRFs (TOG-CRFs) can be trained end to end. Finally, in object stacking scenes, the constructed model can help robot achieve 69.4% success rate for task-oriented grasping.",60018308,Xi'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an,China,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",21.666666666666668,0.22473544973544973,0.523015873015873,1

In this paper, we present a Programming by Demonstration system that synthesizes manipulation programs from a single observed demonstration, allowing users to program new tasks for a robot simply by performing the task once themselves.

2098,2098,Setup and Method for Remote Center of Motion Positioning Guidance during Robot-Assisted Surgery,"During robot-assisted surgery, a Remote Center of Motion (RCM) is often implemented to constrain instrument motion through and about a specific point in space. Aligning and re-positioning this point during surgery is not trivial, as this is a defined, yet often non-visualised, point in space. When misaligned with the patient surrounding anatomy is excessively strained, potentially causing post-operative complications. Not being able to safely re-position the RCM for these purposes limits the use of surgical robotics. This work introduces a general approach relying on anatomy-based haptic fixtures to simplify and improve RCM positioning during robot-assisted surgery. The proposed approach is extended with a novel method and mechanism to mechanically implement such fixtures. This is applied for the use case of vitreoretinal surgery, for which purpose a dedicated robotic setup and fixture mechanism was developed. These were used to conduct an initial experimental validation, during which the feasibility of both a virtual and mechanical implementation is reviewed. Initial outcomes suggest that both implementations are feasible. With the currently used impedance-type system, the mechanical implementation is shown to offer at least one order of magnitude stiffness increase when compared to an equivalent virtual implementation.",60025063,KU Leuven,3000 Leuven,Belgium,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",19.2,0.025000000000000005,0.39062500000000006,1

With the advent of autonomous organization, and network and service management, conventional networks are fast integrated with IoT networks. With minimal human interaction, the security of IoT data travelling through the networks becomes more critical. Data Provenance ensures the path through which data was received for providing integrity and confidence. However, the provenance frameworks are also prone to attacks, as the attacker can manipulate the data and the meta-date used by the provenance mechanism. Therefore, a secure provenance mechanism is required for IoT networks, which is efficient and light-weight as the IoT devices have limited computational and storage resources. In this paper, we propose a secure provenance mechanism which utilizes less storage, specifically designed for IoT devices, by using Bloom-filters and outsourcing attribute based cryptographic mechanisms. The proposed scheme helps in reducing the storage requirement and computational time in IoT devices. The performance of the proposed mechanism is evaluated, and the results show that the proposed solution is best suited for resourced constrained IoT network.",60105081,Islamic University of Madinah,Madinah,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],20.22222222222222,0.1860805860805861,0.4224358974358974,0

Using teams of robots to perform assembly offers numerous advantages such as parallelism, robustness to single-agent failures, and flexibility in scheduling and task assignment. However, while previous work on multi-robot assembly focuses on generating feasible assembly plans and decentralized control strategies, we instead study the problem of planning optimal assembly sequences.To this end, we pose the problem of multi-robot assembly as a discrete optimization, specifically an integer linear program (ILP) or quadratic program (IQP), which aims to minimize the time to complete the assembly, or to minimize the distance traveled. We develop a model of multi-robot assembly that captures both geometric constraints and actuation constraints inherent to the problem. While the ILP and IQP can be solved exactly using commercial optimization software in a substantial amount of time, we also propose heuristic strategies which can be quickly computed, and can scale to structures of reasonable size. We also verify our methods empirically by comparing their performance on a variety of test structures.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",30.166666666666668,0.14853479853479853,0.3996336996336996,1

2103,2103,Thin Vessel Detection and Thick Vessel Edge Enhancement to Boost Performance of Retinal Vessel Extraction Methods," Published by Elsevier B.V.Abnormal changes in the geometry of retinal blood vessels is often a key indicator of certain ocular patholo- gies. Currently, the detection of such pathological changes is largely a manual labor-intensive process that must be performed by expert clinicians to ensure a correct diagnosis. Although there have been previous efforts to automate such diagnostic procedures using computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) applications, these computerized methods seem to lack the necessary sensitivity to detect blood vessels which are of low con- trast, i.e. they are not easily distinguished from their surrounding background. In order to improve CAD detection of low contrast blood vessels, a specialized filter construction is proposed with functionality which can be implemented as an add-on module to enhance the performance of existing CAD blood vessel detector applications. The improved low-contrast detection capability of the specialized filters has been validated by a series of tests in which the proposed technique outperforms other state-of-the-art CAD applications when processing retinal fundus images extracted from publicly available image databases.",60113221,University of Modern Sciences,Dubai,United Arab Emirates,['1700'],28.166666666666668,0.024633699633699633,0.5211538461538461,0

We propose to lift the 2D images to 3D representations using learned neural networks and leverage existing networks working directly on 3D data to perform 3D object detection and localization. We show that, with carefully designed training mechanism and automatically selected minimally noisy data, such a method is not only feasible, but gives higher results than many methods working on actual 3D inputs acquired from physical sensors. On the challenging KITTI benchmark, we show that our 2D to 3D lifted method outperforms many recent competitive 3D networks while significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art for 3D detection from monocular images. We also show that a late fusion of the output of the network trained on generated 3D images, with that trained on real 3D images, improves performance. We find the results very interesting and argue that such a method could serve as a highly reliable backup in case of malfunction of expensive 3D sensors, if not potentially making them redundant, at least in the case of low human injury risk autonomous navigation scenarios like warehouse automation.",60032730,Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,New Delhi,India,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",31.666666666666668,0.08771604938271604,0.5268342151675485,1

The model is able to generate appropriate behavior depending on external (3D point clouds) and internal sensors (ground touch sensor, and Inertial Measurement Unit). Posture condition, safe movement area, possible touchpoint, grasping possibility, and target movement are the information that is analyzed from the sensors. There are four options developed in behavior generation, which are, Approaching, Body Placing, Stepping, and Grasping behavior. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the model was implemented on the computer simulation and the real application. Before being applied in the real robot, the proposed model is optimized in the computer simulation. Then, the optimized parameter is used for applying in the real robot. As a result, the robot succeeded to move through the ladder without handrail from lower stair to upper stair.

2108,2108,Unified Human-Robot Shared Control with Application to Haptic Telemanipulation,"Human-robot shared control (SC) has largely been studied in two complementary forms, namely divisible shared control (DSC) and interactive shared control (ISC). DSC enables clean division of the human and the robot subtasks, thus enabling them to work independently, while ISC allows for flexible intervention to improve the collaborative performance or experience. This paper presents a unified scheme that combines both forms of SCs to attain the benefits of flexibility as well as ease of use when human and robot jointly work on a task together. Based on the idea that flexibility should be embedded in every task constraint that the robot is controlling, we connect ISC into the robot subtask providing a soft boundary between the divided orthogonal subspaces allowing human to access the robot subtask and intervene whenever necessary. We also propose a new simple yet effective Cartesian stiffness adaptation law that enables the robot to modify its endpoint stiffness in the robot's control subspace in the presence of disagreement from the human.

At the moment, such points can be collected and spent only within the same shop (or shops from the same consortium), which makes it only interesting for customers visiting that particular store frequently. However, especially with the increase of e-shops, customers easily switch between stores. With this new shopping behaviour, such programs are less attractive and as such become less effective, requiring a more novel approach. One possibility could be to allow customers to collect and spent loyalty points across stores. In fact, this is just one use case of a more general issue. There are multiple cases in which people receive (digital) resources from organizations or other parties and want to use or exchange them across other organizations or parties. In this paper, we propose a generic framework that allows customers to exchange resources across different parties. We propose to implement this framework with a blockchain-based solution, making the customers in full control and awareness of their available resources as well as creating a decentralized, trustable and safe environment.

Although data partitioning is an essential feature for tuning relational databases, stills an open issue for NewSQL systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid partitioning approach for NewSQL databases that allows the user to define the vertical and horizontal data partitions. In order to determine what site will store each data fragment, we propose a hash function that considers schema information and data access statistics.

2119,2119,A video analysis method on wanfang dataset via deep neural network,"The topic of object detection has been largely improved recently, especially with the development of convolutional neural network. However, there still exist a lot of challenging cases, such as small object, compact and dense or highly overlapping object. Existing methods can detect multiple objects wonderfully, but because of the slight changes between frames, the detection effect of the model will become unstable, the detection results may result in dropping or increasing the object. In the pedestrian flow detection task, such phenomenon can not accurately calculate the flow. To solve this problem, in this paper, we describe the new function for real-time multi-object detection in sports competition and pedestrians flow detection in public based on deep learning. Our work is to extract a video clip and solve this frame of clips efficiently. More specifically, our algorithm includes two stages: Judge method and optimization method. The judge can set a maximum threshold for better results under the model , the threshold value corresponds to the upper limit of the algorithm with better detection results. The optimization method to solve detection jitter problem. Because of the occurrence of frame hopping in the video, and it will result in the generation of video fragments discontinuity. We use optimization algorithm to get the key value, and then the detection result value of index is replaced by key value to stabilize the change of detection result sequence. Based on the proposed algorithm, we adopt wanfang sports competition dataset as the main test dataset and our own test dataset for YOLOv3-Abnormal Number Version(YOLOv3-ANV), which is 5.4% average improvement compared with existing methods. Also, video above the threshold value can be obtained for further analysis. Spontaneously, our work also can used for pedestrians flow detection and pedestrian alarm tasks.

2120,2120,Generative transferable adversarial attack,"Despite their superior performance in computer vision tasks, deep neural networks are found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, slightly perturbed examples that can mislead trained models. Moreover, adversarial examples are often transferable, i.e., adversaries crafted for one model can attack another model. Most existing adversarial attack methods are iterative or optimization-based, consuming relatively long time in crafting adversarial examples. Besides, the crafted examples usually underfit or overfit the source model, which reduces their transferability to other target models. In this paper, we introduce the Generative Transferable Adversarial Attack (GTAA), which generate highly transferable adversarial examples efficiently. GTAA leverages a generator network to produce adversarial examples in a single forward pass. To further enhance the transferability, we train the generator with an objective of making the intermediate features of the generated examples diverge from those of their original version. Extensive experiments on challenging ILSVRC2012 dataset show that our method achieves impressive performance in both white-box and black-box attacks. In addition, we verify that our method is even faster than one-step gradient-based method, and the generator converges extremely rapidly in training phase.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",20.11111111111111,0.11452380952380953,0.5252521008403361,1

In this study, we consider a scenario involving two data owners outsourcing their datasets to a cloud service. The cloud performs a set union computation, after which the querier sends a query to obtain information from both datasets.

2122,2122,Locking-unlocking mechanism actuated by SMA springs to improve the energy efficiency of fabric-type soft actuators,"Wearable robots use batteries as a power source; therefore, the efficiency of the actuation mechanism must be improved to increase their operation time. Soft wearable robots using fabric-type soft actuators (FSA) have attracted much interest recently. In FSAs, the actuator itself is soft, flexible, and lightweight, and energy must be continuously supplied to support the load and hold the actuation state. In particular, when maintaining a particular posture, such as holding an object, constant energy supply is needed to enable the actuator to support the load. To reduce the energy consumption of the holding motion in FSAs, this study proposes a locking-unlocking mechanism (LUM) that can maintain the FSA's contraction state without sustained energy supply. The LUM is fixed to the FSA's upper end; it consists of a ratchet-pawl mechanism, pawl rotating actuators (PRA) with shape memory alloy springs, and a wire encoder. The PRA enables the pawl to lock and unlock the ratchet. One end of the wire encoder connected to the ratchet's rotary shaft is fixed at the bottom part of the FSA, thereby maintaining the FSA contraction state and measuring the contraction length. The LUM's displacement controller can control the FSA to a specific displacement length. This paper presents the design procedure, operating test, and performance evaluation for energy efficiency improvement of the LUM. When the LUM is applied, FSA can maintain the contraction state while supporting the load, making energy consumption unnecessary. As a result, we expect that applying the LUM with FSAs to soft wearable robots can improve the operation time by at least two times.",60032144,Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology,Yusong,South Korea,['1711'],21.75,0.04019607843137254,0.31911764705882356,1

A few noisy remote sensing images are tested and the simulation results of MATLAB confirm the merits of the proposed denoising technique compared with other wavelet-based techniques by measuring evaluation metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio and mean square error.

The problem with this method is that a user of such system must have at least one account in at least one social media and must write at least one status with certain length. We propose to use the combination of personality traits and demographic data to overcome this problem. Previous studies reveal that personality traits are influenced by age and gender. By using these findings, we will build models to predict personality traits from such demographic data. The modeling will be conducted by means of classification and association rule methods.

This paper introduces an approach for facilitating the design of domain-specific data models using semantic web technologies. In this approach, all the information required for managing the production (including a description of a product, processes involved in the production, and existing resources and their specifications) is captured in an ontology. The proposed Product, Process, and Resource (PPR) ontology defines fundamental conceptualization of the production that can be easily applied to the arbitrary domain. Application of the PPR ontology is demonstrated in the case of simple truck assembling by means of robots. Capturing the knowledge in the form of ontology provides the advantage of employing supporting tools such as reasoners for consistency checking or query languages for information extraction. The paper demonstrates the utilization of SQWRL for searching resources suitable to manipulate given truck parts on the basis of semantic matching between properties of particular elements.",60033241,Universität des Saarlandes,Saarbrucken,Germany,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",25.714285714285715,0.11904761904761905,0.4415816326530612,1

The community search algorithm is currently an essential graph data management tool to find a community suited to a user-specified query node. Although community search algorithms are useful in various web-based applications and services, they have trouble handling attributed graphs due to the strict topological constraints of traditional algorithms. In this paper, we propose an accurate community search algorithm for attributed graphs. To overcome current limitations, we define a new attribute-driven community search problem class called the Flexible Attributed Truss Community (F-ATC). The advantage of the F-ATC problem is that it relaxes topological constraints, allowing diverse communities to be explored. Consequently, the community search accuracy is enhanced compared to traditional community search algorithms. Additionally, we present a novel heuristic algorithm to solve the F-ATC problem. This effective algorithm detects more accurate communities from attributed graphs than the traditional algorithms.

If a certain restaurant has many repeaters, the restaurant must be great. How-ever, restaurant review sites usually do not provide a ""revisit rate"". Therefore, we tackle a problem for determining whether a review is a repeater's review, or not. There are many sentences in a review comment that are completely not useful for determining whether the review is a repeater review, such as what was ordered, what was delicious, or how was the price. To confront such difficulties, we have taken the following approach. First, very various features are extracted from review comments so as not to miss the features that represent repeaters' reviews. Next, from the very various fea-tures, only the necessary features that really contribute to the clas-sification is selected by a feature selection method.

Thus, our approach has the purpose of minimizing the sparsity problem by ranking the best features for a particular user, and also, of solving the item cold-start problem, since the feature ranking task is based on features shared between old items and the new item.We evaluate PLDSD in the context of a LOD-based Recommender System using mixed data from DBpedia and MovieLens, and the experimental results indicate better accuracy of recommendations compared to a non-personalized baseline similarity method.",60013710,Universidade Federal da Bahia,Salvador,Brazil,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",38.5,0.22039141414141417,0.442739898989899,1

The algorithm uses the wavelet transform to extract the vertical component of the original infrared image, and uses the Gaussian kernel function to generate the one-dimensional vector to smooth the vertical component, and the wavelet reconstruction outputs the corrected image. The algorithm can accurately remove infrared noise without causing more troublesome ""ghosting"" problems.

Most existing studies use attention maps from the classification network as supervision, which suffers from only locating small discriminative parts of objects and lacking precise boundaries. In this study, we propose a collaborative segmentation network consisting of a localization sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. The localization sub-network takes only image-level labels as supervision. The pseudo masks generated by the segmentation sub-network and the localization sub-network, providing rough localization information of objects and the shape information respectively, are mixed-up adaptively and used as supervision for the segmentation sub-network. The two sub-networks share the same backbone and are shown to mutually enhance each other during training.

However, due to the ill-posed nature of haze, an excellent characteristics representation capacity is still challenging. In this paper, we propose a lightweight yet effective senet-residual (SE-Res) multiscale end-to-end neural network named SRM-Net. Inspired by the remarkable performance of residual networks, we introduce a SE-Res structure which is an improved residual framework with an embedded SE unit to obtain feature maps. These maps pass through a multiscale mapping layer which can aggregate characteristics in different receptive fields. Notably, the utilization of all point-wise convolutions in the SRM-Net leads to fewer parameters for training, and the reuse of feature maps makes it more lightweight. Through extensive numerical experiments on three datasets including real hazy images, synthetic indoor and outdoor hazy images, the proposed SRM-Net achieves superior performances on subjective visual results and objective evaluation metrics compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.428571428571427,0.32519841269841276,0.5151455026455026,1

The conventional grid is increasingly becoming a bottleneck for expanding the share of RES because of its rigid architecture, which is built around centralized energy source. We propose a new energy exchange model for a routed energy distribution system, which can perform electricity routing based on smart routing algorithms and presented protocols.

However, the quality of the underlying medical data is a major challenge when applying ML in medical decision making. In particular, the imbalanced class distribution problem causes the ML model to be biased towards the majority class. Furthermore, the accuracy will be biased, too, which produces the Accuracy Paradox. In this paper, we identify an optimal ML model for predicting mortality risk for Intensive Care Units (ICU) patients. We comprehensively assess an approach that leverages the efficiency of ML ensemble learning (in particular, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) and clustering-based data sampling to handle the imbalanced data problem that this model faces.

It is the expression about the event that an airship flies in the sky gracefully. There are a few reasons why the expression is accepted for people. ""airship flie"" and the motion of a sea creature, for example ""whale swims,"" represent both ""the normal move in a space"" and there is a simi-larity.

This laboratory-based X-ray source was designed to generate a broad (170 mm x 60 mm), uniform, and collimated X-ray beam, with a residual divergence of 1.5 arcsec HEW at either 1.49 keV and 4.51 keV. The main scientific driver for BEaTriX is represented by the opportunity to routinely calibrate the modular elements of the ATHENA (ESA) X-ray telescope, based on the silicon pore optics (SPO) technology. Nevertheless, the application domain of BEaTriX is potentially much wider (e.g., X-ray tomography). BEaTriX comprises a microfocus source of X-rays, followed by an optical chain including a collimating mirror, crystal monochromators, and an asymmetric beam expander. The final beam collimation and homogeneity relies on the optical quality of the optical components (X-ray source dimension, mirror polishing, crystal lattice regularity) and on their mutual alignment. In order to determine the most critical parameters, focus the development efforts, and establish specifications, a set of optical simulations has been built.

To implement this idea effectively and efficiently, we perform two-stage of training procedure, i.e., running estimation of class centers of original data in feature space, and training deep neural networks with modified loss term of Mixup. Besides, the proposed approach is also compatible with other variants of Mixup.

Locating facial landmarks in images is an important task in image processing, and detecting these landmarks automatically still remains a challenge. The appearance of facial landmarks may vary tremendously due to facial expressions and pose variations. Detecting and localising landmarks from raw face data are often performed manually by trained and experienced scientists or clinicians, and this process is laborious and tedious. In order to overcome these challenges, a novel non-template based automatic landmarking method on 3D face data is presented. The geometric approach is employed through utilising the surface curvatures, primitive surfaces information to detect and extract potential features. Subsequently, K-means clustering is applied to categorise and obtain the centroid of extracted features, which is later use to estimate and localise facial landmarks.

The score drops significantly, in case when the ASR system is being used with a non-native speaker of the language to be recognized. The main reason is specific pronunciation and accent features. A limited volume of labeled nonnative speech datasets makes it difficult to train new ASR systems for non-native speakers. In our research,we tried tackling the problem and its influence on the accuracy of ASR systems, using the style transfer methodology. We designed a pipeline for modifying the speech of a non-native speaker, so that it resembles the native speech to a higher extent. Our methodology can be used as a wrapper for any existing ASR system, which reduces the necessity of training new algorithms for non-native speech.

Traditional segmentation usually relies on a large annotated dataset and needs to be pre-trained for each target, which exhausts much time in both training and testing due to the large number and resolution of the images. In this paper, we proposed a STSS (Saliency and Tracking based Semi-supervised Learning for Segmentation) algorithm that provides the segmentation binary mask of target satellites at 12 frames per second without requirement of annotated data. Our method, STSS, improves the segmentation performance by generating a saliency map based semi-supervised on-line learning approach within the initial bounding box estimated by tracking.

The impact of this approach on the long-term reliability of DEAs is, however, still unknown. In the present work, it is investigated how the elastomer lifetime is affected by the mechanical pre-stretch. Silicone membrane samples with different pre-stretch ratios were prepared and the respective DC dielectric strengths were measured for both short and prolonged tests using methodologies inherited from high voltage assessment technology. It is shown that, despite an absolute beneficial increase of the dielectric strength for the tensioned membranes, pre-stretching has a detrimental effect on the system's useful life. In all the studied cases, the pre-stretched specimens showed a shorter expected lifetime compared to new, relaxed membranes.

Statistical and linguistic methods of thesaurus construction that allow automation of their development and reduce the labor costs of expert linguists have been studied. In particular, algorithms for extracting keywords and semantic thesaurus relations of all types have been considered and the quality of the thesauri generated with the use of these tools was assessed. To illustrate features of various methods of constructing thesaurus relations, the authors developed a combined method that fully automatically generates a specialized thesaurus based on a text corpus of a selected domain and several existing linguistic resources. The proposed method was used to conduct experiments on two Russian-language text corpora that represent two different domains: articles on migration and tweets. The resulting thesauri were analyzed by means of an integrated assessment that had been developed by the authors in a previous study and allows one to determine various aspects of the analyzed thesaurus and appraise the quality of the methods of its generation.

In this method, the coordinate system transformation and simple vector addition are used to reduce the storage space of each pixel's primary ray-object intersection point and unit normal vector. We implemented the experiment of data transfer in a Hadoop ray tracing cluster with gigabit switch. First, we compared the cost under different types of data transfer. Secondly, we measured the execution time of the compression method. Finally, we analyze the reason for the error between the decompressed data and the origin data.

Convolutional neural network has reached great performance in image processing (e.g. denoise, deblur, super-resolution), however deeper network may cause vanishing or exploding gradient problems, and it is hard to apply in realistic scene for high complexity. Thus, the residual blocks (RB) are proposed to balance between performance and application, besides, this paper exploits pyramid convolutional neural network to learn coarse-fine feature. In order to handle various resolutions, the fixed patch based method is used to adapt realistic scene.

In this paper, we propose the Mind Sensing Service, which allows a service operator to define and manage the questions flexibly, and to automate the delivery of the questions and the collection of the answers. The proposed service consist of two elements: Actions and rules. An action defines the contents of specific questions such as what message is sent to which elderly people. A rule defines the conditions on when, where, and by what event, in order to execute the action. The proposed service makes it possible to implement more systematic and flexible Mind Sensing.",60030933,Osaka Institute of Technology,Osaka,Japan,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.25,0.018452380952380953,0.3758928571428572,1

The rough dataset comprises 15.414 annotated characters and 633 classes. However, only 162 classes have sufficient data samples to be the training and testing one. Using this dataset, we measured the performance of four classifiers, namely k-NN, LDA, SVM, and Gaussian NB on the accuracy, micro- A veraged precision, micro- A veraged sensitivity and weighted- A veraged precision and sensitivity metrices. The experiment shows that k-NN outperforms any other classifiers almost in most metrices, while SVM suffers the poorest performance.

To solve the problem that the EM image cannot be accurately segmented due to the complexity of the submicroscopic structure of nerve cells, and the loss and blurring of the boundary, an EM image segmentation method of nerve cells based on Conditional Random Field model is proposed. Firstly, the initial seed points of organelle and background to be segmented are automatically selected by superpixel clustering, and then the probability density distribution of target and background which selected as seed points is estimated by Gaussian Mixture Model. Then the energy function of superpixel features is established by using Conditional Random Field model. Finally, the automatic segmentation of nerve cell image is realized by minimizing the energy function. The effect of the automatically segmented nerve cell target and background is compared with that of the manually segmented images. The experimental results show that the nerve cell segmentation effect is improved, the method is robust, and the submicroscopic structure of EM image of nerve cells can be well characterized.",60020464,Guangxi Normal University,Guilin,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",25.428571428571427,0.04722222222222224,0.4990740740740741,1

The proposed approach exploits and links information from several biodiversity-related resources, including the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and the Global Biotic Interactions (GLOBI). In particular, we adopt a data mining technique to extract association rules that support the construction of an initial species interactions knowledge graph.

2213,2213,Fast rankclus algorithm via dynamic rank score tracking on bi-type information networks,"Given a bi-type information network, which is an extended model of well-known bipartite graphs, how can clusters be efficiently found in graphs? Graph clustering is now a fundamental tool to understand overviews from graph-structured data. The RankClus framework accurately performs clustering for bi-type information networks using ranking-based graph clustering techniques. It integrates a graph ranking algorithms such as PageRank or HITS into graph clustering procedures to improve the clustering quality. However, this integration incurs a high computational cost to handle large bi-type information networks since RankClus repeatedly computes the ranking algorithm for all nodes and edges until the clustering procedure converges. To overcome this runtime limitation, herein we present a novel RankClus algorithm that reduces the running time for large bi-type information networks. Our proposed method employs dynamic graph processing techniques into the ranking procedures included in RankClus. By dynamically updating ranking results, our proposal reduces the number of computed nodes and edges during repeated ranking procedures. We experimentally verify using real-world datasets that our proposed method successfully reduces the running time while maintaining the clustering quality of RankClus.",60014256,University of Tsukuba,Tsukuba,Japan,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.375,0.2042857142857143,0.4496825396825396,1

Phishing detection mechanisms using various techniques have been developed. Our hypothesis is that phishers create fake websites with as little information as possible in a webpage, which makes it difficult for content- A nd visual similarity-based detections by analyzing the webpage content. To overcome this, we focus on the use of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to detect phishing. Since previous work extracts specific special-character features, we assume that non- A lphanumeric (NAN) character distributions highly impact the performance of URL-based detection. We hence propose a new feature called the entropy of NAN characters for URL-based phishing detection. Experimental evaluation with balanced and imbalanced datasets shows 96% ROC AUC on the balanced dataset and 89% ROC AUC on the imbalanced dataset, which increases the ROC AUC as 5 to 6% from without adopting our proposed feature.",60023462,Waseda University,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.714285714285715,-0.05412878787878789,0.5133008658008659,1
2215,2215,"A theoretical framework for sensor placement, structural identification and damage detection in tensegrity structures","Tensegrity structures are systems composed of elements in compression and tension in a stable self-equilibrium state that provides stability and stiffness to the structure. Tensegrity finds its root in contemporary art with Kenneth Snelson's sculptures, yet it quickly evolved into a structural paradigm employed in a wide spectrum of science and engineering applications. Tensegrity structures being lightweight, and capable of combining sensors and actuators with structural elements, they are advantageous for active applications. However, in most active applications, sensor placement is based on engineering judgement and not a systematic approach based on the analysis of tensegrity structures. This paper addresses sensor placement for structural identification and damage detection in tensegrity structures using cellular decomposition. By decomposing tensegrity structures into the minimum number of constitutive unicellular sub-structures (cells and stable sub-structures resulting from their interaction), the minimum number of sensors required for their self-stress identification can be defined along with a set of edge solutions for sensor placement. Moreover, under the assumptions of a known deformed geometry and loading, it is shown that the resulting sensor configurations can be extended for structural identification as well as damage detection providing a theoretical framework for active and sensory tensegrity structures based on their cellular composition.",60029251,University of Miami,Coral Gables,United States,['1711'],28.857142857142858,0.07777777777777779,0.4296296296296297,1

Technically, the controlled vocabularies are often provided in the form of SKOS ontologies thus allowing to apply semantic web technologies to establish inter-vocabulary relations and ask queries. However, how can a search over the contents of different digital libraries each of which relies on their own vocabulary be performed without sacrificing recall or having to align the underlying ontologies beforehand?

It was found that the magnetic-field dependences for the bending of plates with ferromagnetic stripes have a critical character with a reproduced hysteresis emerging in the repeated cycles of the magnetic field increasing and decreasing. It was found that the magnetically induced bending has a large magnitude, so that the magnetic moments of the stripes at the bending can be directed almost perpendicularly to the magnetic field. In a strong magnetic field, the effect of stripe orientation is observed, which occurs due to the orienting action of Zeeman interaction. It was shown that the hysteresis phenomenon observed at the bending of a plate with stripes is associated with a strong nonlinearity of magnetostatic interaction between the stripes at their magnetization. The hysteresis recurrence is caused by elastic forces arising at the elastomer bending and competing with magnetostatic dipole-dipole interactions between the stripes. The critical points of transitions between the 'discrete lattice' state of stripes and the state of laterally touching stripes were determined. A model of the phenomenon concerned was proposed which is in good agreement with experimental data.",60011313,National Academy of Sciences in Ukraine,Kiev,Ukraine,['1711'],25.875,0.1939965986394558,0.4900170068027211,1

Real-time video summarization can solve this problem but also face much challenges. Different from file summarization, real-time video summarization requires higher efficiency. Meanwhile, the validity and quality of a summarization should be ensured. To tackle these problems, we propose a real-time video summarization strategy based on dualcamera. In our strategy, a static camera and a PTZ camera are necessary. The static camera is used to monitor the scene to detect and track moving targets, and the PTZ camera is used to capture the close-up information of moving targets as video summarization, and the collaboration of these two cameras is crucial. Specifically, in order to obtain multi-target summarization efficiently and effectively, the priority of target capturing is determined by its spatial information and historical representation in the scene.
