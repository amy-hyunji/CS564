0,0,Building maps of protein structure spaces in template-free protein structure prediction,"An important goal in template-free protein structure prediction is how to control the quality of computed tertiary structures of a target amino-acid sequence. Despite great advances in algorithmic research, given the size, dimensionality, and inherent characteristics of the protein structure space, this task remains exceptionally challenging. It is current practice to aim to generate as many structures as can be afforded so as to increase the likelihood that some of them will reside near the sought but unknown biologically-active/native structure. When operating within a given computational budget, this is impractical and uninformed by any metrics of interest. In this paper, we propose instead to equip algorithms that generate tertiary structures, also known as decoy generation algorithms, with memory of the protein structure space that they explore. Specifically, we propose an evolving, granularity-controllable map of the protein structure space that makes use of low-dimensional representations of protein structures. Evaluations on diverse target sequences that include recent hard CASP targets show that drastic reductions in storage can be made without sacrificing decoy quality. The presented results make the case that integrating a map of the protein structure space is a promising mechanism to enhance decoy generation algorithms in template-free protein structure prediction.",60018319,"George Mason University, Fairfax Campus",Fairfax,United States,['1706'],25.0,0.21083333333333334,0.5941666666666666,1
1,1,Simulation of spatial and temporal distribution of singlet oxygen in port wine stain during vascular targeted photodynamic therapy,"Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (V-PDT) has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment modality for nonmalignant diseases such as capillary malformations port wine stains (PWS). V-PDT treatment of PWS involves a complex interaction of light, photosensitizer (PS), oxygen and biological tissue. A three-dimensional (3D) model of PWS with a Y-bifurcation blood vessels was proposed for mathematical simulation of the spatial and temporal distribution of singlet oxygen (1O2), which related to the distribution of light, PS and oxygen. A graphics processing units (GPU)-based method, Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX), was applied to calculate the light deposition in the PWS, and a set of differential equations were utilized to describe the photochemical reactions involved in V-PDT. Using the obtained light energy deposition and the distributions of the PS and oxygen, a dynamic change model of the cumulative concentration of 1O2 ([1O2]) was estimated. The data show that the smaller vessels are more likely to acquire more [1O2].",60069744,General Hospital of People's Liberation Army,Beijing,China,['1706'],25.5,0.185,0.5711111111111111,1

In order to analyze the nonlinear influence, the piecewise fractional Brownian motion is introduced, which builds the relation between different spectrum parts and the fine/coarse scales, i.e. the target echoes at different velocities can affect the self-similarities of sea clutter at different scales in time domain. Based on the real X-band and Sband sea clutter data, this influence mechanism is studied and verified. The results show that the slow-moving target mainly affects the self-similarity of the sea clutter sequence at the coarse time scales, and the fast-moving target mainly affects the self-similarity of the sea clutter sequence at the fine time scales. This conclusion lays the foundation for introducing the fractal theory into the sea clutter spectrum analysis and target detection in frequency domain.",60073458,China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation,Beijing,China,['1706'],23.666666666666668,0.095,0.4966666666666666,1

6,6,Integration of multi-omics data to mine cancer-related gene modules,"The identification of cancer-related genes is a major research goal, with implications for determining the pathogenesis of cancer and identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, by integrating multi-omics data, including gene expression, DNA copy number variation, DNA methylation, transcription factors, miRNA, and lncRNA data, we propose a method for mining cancer-related genes based on network models. First, using random forest-based feature selection method multi-omics data are integrated to identify key regulatory factors that affect gene expression, and then genome-wide regulatory networks are constructed. Next, by comparing the regulatory networks of key candidate genes in variant samples and non-variant samples, a differential expression regulatory network is generated. The differential network contains a collection of abnormal regulatory genes of key candidate genes. Then, by introducing the functional similarity as a distance metric for gene sets, a density-based clustering method is used to mine gene modules related to cancer. We applied this method to LUSC (lung squamous cell carcinoma) and mined cancer-related gene modules composed of 20 genes. GO function and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that the modules were closely related to cancer. A survival analysis was used to verify that the excavated gene modules can effectively distinguish between high- and low-risk groups. Overall, these results suggest that the proposed method can be used to identify cancer-related gene modules, providing a basis for the development of biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",60092860,Beijing University Of Civil Engineering And Architecture,Beijing,China,['1706'],23.2,0.05173076923076923,0.5210256410256411,1
7,7,Distributional models with syntactic contexts for the measurement of word similarity in brazilian portuguese," Berlitz, Denis A. Araujo, Allan B. Silva, Rodrigo R. Righi and Sandro J. Rigo.The similarity between words constitutes significant support to tasks in natural language processing. Several works use Lexical resources such as WordNet for semantic similarity and synonym identification. Nevertheless, words out-of-vocabulary or missing links between senses are perceived problems of this approach. Distributional-based proposals like word embeddings have successfully been used to meet such problems, but the lack of contextual information can prevent the achievement of even better results. The distributional models that include contextual information can bring advantages to this area, but these models are still scarcely explored. Therefore, this work studies the advantages of incorporating syntactic information in the distributional models, fostering for better results in semantic similarity approaches. For that purpose, the current work explore existing lexical and distributional techniques regarding the measurement of word similarity in Brazilian Portuguese. Experiments were carried out with the lexical database WordNet, using different techniques over a standard dataset. The results indicate that word embeddings can cover words out of vocabulary and have better results in comparison with lexical approaches. The main contribution of this article is a new approach to apply syntactic context in the training process of word embeddings to a Brazilian Portuguese corpus. The comparison of this model with the outcome of the previous experiments shows sound results and presents relevant complementary aspects.",60024559,Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos,Sao Leopoldo,Brazil,"['1712', '1705', '1702']",15.2,0.19229797979797977,0.4460858585858586,0
8,8,Rapid cell phase imaging using quantitative interferometric microscopy with fast shearing phase unwrapping method,"Cell observations and analysis are often required in biological and medical fields for cell condition evaluations and disease diagnostics. Compared to classical methods such as bright/dark field microscopy and fluorescent microscopy, quantitative interferometric microscopy as one of the quantitative phase microscopic techniques is able to provide high contrast image of label free samples thus can be potentially using in live cell imaging. While it often suffers from the low processing speed often due to the heavy computational load in phase unwrapping. In order to accelerate the imaging speed, we design a rapid cell phase imaging technique relying on the fast shearing phase unwrapping method. It can extract the sample information from a single-shot interferogram showing that it can capture live cell images. Moreover, the phase unwrapping process is significantly reduced with accelerated speed. Considering the system can provide quantitative and high-contrast live cell imaging in label free mode with high accuracy, fast speed and large field of view, it can be a potential tool for cell observations and measurements in biological and medical applications.",60007029,Jiangnan University,Wuxi,China,['1706'],24.857142857142858,0.0951534828807556,0.5310714285714285,1
9,9,SIN-KNO: A method of gene regulatory network inference using single-cell transcription and gene knockout data,"As a tool of interpreting and analyzing genetic data, gene regulatory network (GRN) could reveal regulatory relationships between genes, proteins, and small molecules, as well as understand physiological activities and functions within biological cells, interact in pathways, and how to make changes in the organism. Traditional GRN research focuses on the analysis of the regulatory relationships through the average of cellular gene expressions. These methods are difficult to identify the cell heterogeneity of gene expression. Existing methods for inferring GRN using single-cell transcriptional data lack expression information when genes reach steady state, and the high dimensionality of single-cell data leads to high temporal and spatial complexity of the algorithm. In order to solve the problem in traditional GRN inference methods, including the lack of cellular heterogeneity information, single-cell data complexity and lack of steady-state information, we propose a method for GRN inference using single-cell transcription and gene knockout data, called SINgle-cell transcription data-KNOckout data (SIN-KNO), which focuses on combining dynamic and steady-state information of regulatory relationship contained in gene expression. Capturing cell heterogeneity information could help understand the gene expression difference in different cells. So, we could observe gene expression changes more accurately. Gene knockout data could observe the gene expression levels at steady-state of all other genes when one gene is knockout. Classifying the genes before analyzing the single-cell data could determine a large number of non-existent regulation, greatly reducing the number of regulation required for inference. In order to show the efficiency, the proposed method has been compared with several typical methods in this area including GENIE3, JUMP3, and SINCERITIES. The results of the evaluation indicate that the proposed method can analyze the diversified information contained in the two types of data, establish a more accurate gene regulation network, and improve the computational efficiency. The method provides a new thinking for dealing with large datasets and high computational complexity of single-cell data in the GRN inference.",60083500,Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences,Taiyuan,China,['1706'],26.5,0.11908795749704842,0.5177282565918929,1

However, since the definition of aircraft instability is entirely dependent on the airline, these precursors might change according to the applied criteria. Most of the times, these precursors are related to the operation, ATC instructions, nearby weather conditions or even specific procedures for the selected airport or runway.

Therefore detection of circulating melanoma cells plays an important role in monitoring tumor metastasis and prevention after diagnosis. In Vivo Photoacoustic Flow Cytometry (PAFC) is established here to achieve in vivo melanoma inspection, meanwhile guarantees non-invasive and real-time detection.Accurate tumor cell detection is of great significance to achieve highly specific diagnosis and avoid unnecessary medical tests.However, the amount of data detected by PAFC is large and original photoacoustic signal is mixed with various noises.The traditional triple mean square deviation method has lower accuracy and consumes a lot of time in data processing. Here, a classification approach in photoacoustic is proposed, which could discriminate signals and noises based on features extracted from photoacoustic waves compared to normal cells using Support Vector Machines algorithm. Due to similar shape and structure of cells, the photoacoustic signals usually have similar vibration mode. By analyzing the correlations and the signal features in time domain and frequency domain, we finally choose the continuity, amplitude, and photoacoustic waveform pulse width as the features to characterize the signal.More than 600,000 samples were selected as the training set (normalized in advance), and a classifier with a precision of 85% accuracy to filter out the photoacoustic signals rapidly was trained by the support vector machine method.The classifier introduced here has proved to optimize the signal acquisition and reduce signal processing time, realizing real-time detection and real-time analysis in PAFC.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,['1706'],41.666666666666664,0.050105042016806725,0.5421218487394958,1

27,27,"Securing IoT-based groups: Efficient, scalable and fault-tolerant key management protocol","Group key management protocols are crucial in establishing secured communication channels for collaborative IoT-based groups. The Internet of Things (IoT) dimension includes additional challenges. In fact, resource constrained members within dynamic and heterogeneous groups are unable to run existing group key protocols. Furthermore, these protocols need to be scalable and fault tolerant to suit growing and sensitive groups. To face these issues, we enhance our previously proposed protocol called Decentralized Batch-based Group Key protocol (DBGK). Using polynomial computation to secure data exchanges, we considerably improve its scalability, fault tolerance and collusion freeness properties. Furthermore, we include an energy preserving blockchain-based mechanism to authenticate group members credentials in a distributed manner. To assess our new protocol called DiStributed Batch-based Group Key protocol (DsBGK), we performed a detailed theoretical security analysis to evaluate its behaviour against well studied attacks in the literature. Furthermore, we validated this analysis using a formal validation tool. To evaluate DsBGK performances, we performed extensive simulations. We proceeded by comparing DsBGK in term of energy cost, first, with DBGK, then with other analogous protocols from the literature. The results confirmed the security soundness of DsBGK, in addition to an improved energy efficiency compared to its peers.",60104289,Université de Lorraine,Nancy,France,['1700'],16.5,0.05526094276094276,0.6183080808080809,1

In this paper, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network model and a Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressor (SARIMAX) were trained on air quality and meteorological time series data at the Chokchai metropolitan police station area in Bangkok from 2017 to 2018. After figuring out the best configuration of both algorithms, the performance of the LSTM model to predict PM2.5 concentrations for 24 hours was evaluated and compared against the SARIMAX model. Our experiments indicated that LSTM had a better prediction accuracy as indicated by the RMSE and MAE values for each of the time steps. LSTM could forecast one hour ahead at a very low RMSE of 3.11 micrograms per cubic meter on average, and a MAE of 2.36 micrograms per cubic meter on average, while SARIMAX errors were more than doubled.

A literature review," All rights reserved.In the last few years, several works have emerged focusing on the cultural change that has to do with the simultaneous and sequential coexistence between different media. This is what is being called transmedia, and it is related to the new concepts of media convergence and participatory culture. All this new mediatic and cultural movement, of course, begins to have an echo in the educational world. However, what do we mean by this concept from an educational perspective? Through a systematic literature review, we analyse this transmedia concept in three meanings: transmedia as ability or literacy necessary to actively evolve in this movement of participatory culture; transmedia as the product resulting from that sequential jump between different analogical and digital media, conveyed by a narrative; and, lastly, transmedia as a didactic strategy that explores that narrative that is developed in different means to achieve concrete didactic objectives.",60009952,Universitat de Girona,Girona,Spain,['1706'],37.5,-0.019232093663911844,0.3877238292011018,0

The study is conducted on the data extracted from a multilingual parallel corpus that was created for this purpose.

39,39,Reducing impact of delays using airspace user-driven flight prioritisation: User driven prioritisation process validation simulation and results," All rights reserved.With resumed air traffic growth for a few years now, the European Air Traffic Management Network is about to reach its capacity limits. This growth will continue to generate increasing delays to flights and for passengers. There are two ways to address such increases in delay. One is to strive to augment the capacity. The other is to reduce the impact of the delay on airlines and passengers. The User Driven Prioritization Process (UDPP) followed the second approach. UDPP provides additional flexibility for airlines within constrained situations where delays occur during the planning phase; this concept allows prioritisation over several flights, beyond the current slot swapping process. Previous publications introduced the main UDPP principles and early features for airlines that have many flights involved in a constraint generating delays together with, extra flexibility to airspace users with very few flights involved in the same constraint. This paper reports on the UDPP latest improvements, in particular the new “Margins” feature, and the validation results related to a first integration of UDPP with an Airport Operations Centre.

Inspired by the covariance matrix reconstruction (CMR) algorithm of eigen-projection matrix preprocessing, the paper combines modified CMR and BMP algorithm to suppress main lobe jamming. The modified CMR can not only be used when the dimension is lost caused by BMP, but also solve the distortion problems such as the main lobe peak offset in the adaptive beam forming synthesis. The biggest advantage of BMP combined with modified CMR algorithm is that its anti-jamming performance is excellent and stable when the sampling snapshot contains the target signal. Meanwhile, the algorithm complexity and the snapshot sensitivity are both in a low level. In the end, the verification results of the measured data also show the superiority of the proposed algorithm when the sampling snapshot contains the target signal.",60028265,Lanzhou University,Lanzhou,China,['1706'],30.166666666666668,0.16666666666666666,0.5458333333333333,1

Percentages of values were compared in the implementation under study, which concentrated in the limits of estimated quantiles. Implementations were obtained using the simulation method. By the same method, the correctness (relative systematic error) of determining the quantile values of the specified levels was evaluated. The error value δ was estimated between the conditionally true quantile value calculated from the generated pseudogeneral complex and the value estimated using the methods considered in the paper.

53,53,Quantitative differential phase microscopy based on structured illumination," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) is a well-known super-resolution imaging technique, which exploits moiré patterns created when a sample is illuminated with periodic stripes. Conventional SIM often applies to fluorescent samples, or the samples which have absorption on illumination light. Here we report quantitative phase imaging of transparent samples with a SIM apparatus in transmittance-mode. For this purpose, two sets of fringe patterns, which have two orthogonal orientations and five phase-shifts for each orientation, were generated by a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) and projected on a sample. Under different fringe illuminations slightly-defocused images of the sample were recorded sequentially by a CCD camera, where the object waves along the ±1st orders of the illumination interfere with each other with a lateral shear in-between. The phase derivatives of the sample along the shear direction can be reconstructed from the phase-shifted intensity patterns. Eventually, the quantitative phase distribution of the sample was obtained by integrating the two phase derivatives. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm was used to enhance the resolution of the phase image, considering the structured illumination synthesizes a larger spectrum in the Fourier domain, similar to oblique illuminations in digital holography. This apparatus can also work in the conventional SIM mode, which images fluorescent samples in an in-focus manner.

WSC is a modern version of the famous Turing test. Its objective is to check a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. In contrast to other approaches to WSC, which are based on machine learning, our method uses explicit knowledge. An important advantage of this approach is that it gives an opportunity to provide an explanation of the result understandable for humans. SemETAP interprets the text using both linguistic and extralinguistic (background) knowledge. The former is stored in the grammar and the dictionary of the ETAP-4 system, and the latter is provided by the SemETAP ontology, inference rules and the repository of individuals. We show how this knowledge is used for resolving WSC. At the moment, the performance of the algorithm is not high—54%. This is due to the incompleteness of the background knowledge supplied to the system. It is shown, however, that if the background knowledge is complete and accurate enough, the WSC test is resolved well and it is easily understandable why the system arrived at a particular conclusion.",60028442,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Madrid,Spain,['1706'],18.454545454545453,0.178125,0.434375,0
55,55,Three-dimensional measurement of rotating combinative Dammann gratings," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.As an important means to obtain three-dimensional depth information of target, optical measurement has been widely used in face recognition, machine manufacturing, aerospace and other related fields in the past decades. Optical three-dimensional imaging and depth measurement is a fast and non-contact method for reconstructing three-dimensional imaging and depth measurement of objects based on optical means and digital image processing analysis. In this paper, a three-dimensional measurement module of transversely rotating combined Dammann grating is proposed, which generates interleaved high-density dot-matrix structured light for three-dimensional imaging and measurement. The measurement module consists of integrated components of laser and beam expander, collimating lens, four transversely rotating combined Dammann gratings with different beam splitting ratios, and objective lens. The laser emits a laser beam which is collimated by a collimating lens. Four Dammann gratings are used to generate four non-staggered dot-matrix by splitting them, and then the high-density staggered projection dot-matrix for three-dimensional measurement and imaging are projected by the objective lens. The measurement module has the advantages of simple structure, high output dot-matrix density, staggered projection dot-matrix edges, and easy integration into mobile devices. This technology may reduce the complexity, number of optical elements, power consumption and cost of structured light projectors in mobile and fixed 3D sensors.",60017456,Jinan University,Guangzhou,China,['1706'],27.125,0.09519607843137257,0.4385574229691876,0

Using two Panda PMFs with or without polyacrylate buffer coating and one Bow-tie PMF with golden polyimide coating as experimental samples, we find that: I) the polarization crosstalk can be highly linear with the T-stress for PMFs no matter with or without coating; II) the polyacrylate coating can reduce the crosstalk sensitivity of naked PMFs by more than hundreds of times, while replacing the polyacrylate coating with polyimide coating can increase the sensitivity by tens or even hundreds of times; III) the polyacrylate coating can induce a significant recovery time of crosstalk when a T-stress is removed after a long loading time compared with that in naked PMFs or golden PMF with polyimide coating, however the crosstalk response speed is too fast to be measured by the DPXA system. Additionally, we also find that the current polyimide coating technique still needs to be improved further to reduce the crosstalk base level.

Biochemical and genetic methods and 3D materials/structures have been developed and making great progress in controlling the development and differentiation of stem cells. One of the major remaining concerns is the invasion of those technologies. In this study, we demonstrate an all-optical and noninvasive approach to precisely induce the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and cerebellar granule neuron progenitor (GNP) cells. We show that the single-time fast-flash of photostimulation by a tightly-focused femtosecond laser, without any optogenetics, can activate endogenous signaling pathways for stem-cell differentiation directly by multiphoton excitation. The significant upregulation of differentiation regulator RUNX2 and Osterix in ADSCs 7 days after photostimulation indicates the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs. The differentiation was finally confirmed by Alizarin red staining 28 days after photostimulation. The differentiation of GNP cells in vitro and in vivo can also be induced by this method. This noninvasive optical technology hence provides an encouraging advance to activation of signaling pathways in cells and alternative to classic biochemical methods for stem-cell differentiation.

62,62,Super-resolution x-ray luminescence optical tomography imaging,"X-ray luminescence optical tomography (XLOT) is a promising in vivo noninvasive imaging technique. By using x-rays to irradiate nanophosphors (NPs) in imaged region, XLOT can achieve better imaging depth and higher imaging sensitivity than the widely used optical molecular tomographic imaging techniques, e.g., bioluminescence tomography (BLT) or fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT). However, compared with the anatomical imaging techniques, e.g., x-ray computed tomography (XCT), XLOT has the disadvantage of low spatial resolution limited to millimeters. To overcome the limitation, recently, many efforts have been dedicated to optimize the data acquisition schemes and improve reconstruction methods. Nevertheless, challenges remain in XLOT due to the light scattering in biological tissues and the severely ill-condition and ill-posed of the inverse problem of XLOT. To improve the spatial resolution of XLOT, inspired by super-resolution localization optical microscopy, in this work, we propose a novel imaging method, termed as SR-XLOT, which is achieved by locating the position of NPs in each frame by using the single emitter localization methods (e.g., Gaussian fitting method). After reconstructing the positions of NPs in each frame, a super-resolution XLOT image can be generated by superimposing the identified positions of NPs from all frames into one image. To evaluate the performance of the proposed SR-XLOT method, a series of numerical simulation experiments were performed. The experimental results indicate that when using SR-XLOT method, the spatial resolution of XLOT can be significantly improved, compared with the conventional reconstruction methods. As a result, the method makes it possible to implement a super-resolution XLOT imaging, which is attractive for medical diagnostic and drug research.",60023813,Shanghai University,Shanghai,China,['1706'],26.0,0.18319327731092436,0.4861344537815126,1

69,69,Phase retrieval algorithm based on the neural network and the GS," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Optical waves can be described by intensity and phase. However, optical waves oscillate too fast for detectors to measure anything but time-averaged intensities. This is unfortunate since the phase can reveal important information about the object. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the known intensity information to retrieve the phase information, which is called phase retrieval. As a classical phase retrieval algorithm, the Gerchberg-Saxton iteration method has the characteristics of continuous error reduction, but a large number of iterations are needed to obtain high-quality retrieval results. The field of neural network algorithm was initially inspired by the goal of modeling biological neural systems, but then parted ways and became an engineering problem with good results in the field of machine learning. This kind of network relies on the complexity of the system to process information by adjusting the interconnection among a large number of internal nodes. A new algorithm combined the neural network and the Gerchberg-Saxton iterative is proposed. Firstly, the initial phase is obtained by Gerchberg-Saxton iteration method, and then a good training model is obtained by using paired initial phase and precise phase training neural network. For the samples in the test set, the trained model is applied to the phase retrieval results of Gerchberg-Saxton iteration method to obtain more accurate phase results.

A need of positioning and navigation of small-sized mobile objects arises frequently. At the same time, the size of controlled objects is constantly decreasing, and the development of sensors for micro-and nanoscale objects is already required nowadays. Therefore, the use of nanostructured metasurfaces in position control and navigation systems seems to be extremely promising.

A membrane capacitance mediation mechanism had been proved to act as a chromophore in the mediation this thermal effect with the cell function. Here, we explored a continuous infrared laser irradiation situation, which was a case in clinic. A continuous near infrared laser with a wavelength centered at 980nm was employed to irradiate a neuron cell in vitro. And a patch clamp technique was employed to record a whole cell current. The whole cell current was formed by a compensated capacitance current, a rapid voltage-dependent inward sodium current, and a slowly voltage-dependent outward-rectifier potassium current. After a 36s irradiation, the potassium current was changed not that much, but the sodium current was decreased in its peak current. We analyzed the compensated capacitance current and found that the infrared irradiation decreased the membrane capacitance also.

74,74,Power spectral density of V2V communication system in the presence of moving scatterers,"A communication system of Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) consists of a transmitter, a receiver, and scatterers which can move in random speeds and directions to generate the Doppler Effect that reduces communications system performance. The Doppler effect that occurs in V2V channel modeling is a combination of the Doppler effect on each of its constituent components. After being combined with the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) multi-carrier system, the signal received at the receiving end experiences attenuation due to the characteristics of the channel used. To analyze the attenuation factor received due to the influence of channel characteristics, the power spectral density parameter is used. Previous research was limited to modeling the V2V channel with moving scatterers, without knowing the effect of velocity on power spectral density. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of velocity parameters of V2V's components on power spectral density where scatterers moved randomly. Moving scatterers speed was classified into two categories, where the scatterers were faster or slower than the sender and receiver. The power spectral density was analyzed after combining Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation with multi-carrier OFDM. The results show that components with higher velocity yielded more damped power spectral density on the receiver that reached-0.7099 dB/Hz. Moreover, the number of scatterers that moved around the transmitter and receiver highly affected the magnitude of the Doppler effect. The largest Doppler Shift generated in this study was 13.5 kHz with attenuated power spectral density at-0.8646 dB/Hz.",60114126,Institut Teknologi Telkom Purwokerto,Purwokerto,Indonesia,['1700'],22.363636363636363,-0.06423280423280424,0.39994708994708994,1

Early detection as well as precise intraoperative diagnosis of cancers is crucial to improving the prognosis and thus significantly decreasing the mortality. Two-photon excitation fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and spectroscopy not only shows the outstanding capability of label-free, intravital, high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging but also allows the quantitative biochemical characterizing of live tissues. Benefiting from these advantages, this technology is promising for early detection and demarcation of malignant tumors. However, its full potential has not been extensively evaluated in clinical settings. Here, we assess the feasibility of using two-photon excitation fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and spectroscopy to identify various cancers, including esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and brain cancer. In terms of esophageal cancer, we compared the fresh human esophageal mucosal tissues of normal, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. For gastric cancer, we performed a systematic investigation on fresh human gastric mucosal specimens at typical stages of gastric carcinogenesis. In addition, by developing a mouse chronic cranial window, we carried out a preliminary study on glioma margin identification in vivo. By extracting fluorescence spectrum and lifetime information of endogenous fluorophores, qualitative and quantitative indicators which are found to have the potential to discriminate normal, premalignant and different malignant lesions are derived.

In this work we explore the idea of implementing zone melting on a micrometer scale by localized heating induced by focused electron beam irradiation. The model structure is a thin metallic stripe on a quartz substrate. The peak temperature and the temperature profile around the heated zone are evaluated by finite element simulations. The results show that the molten zone is narrow but when it is at the end of the stripe, the peak temperature increases. This effect was compensated by introducing heatsinks with optimized size. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed on the optimized structures in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) modified for operation with a higher beam current.",60019878,Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski,Sofia,Bulgaria,['1706'],18.363636363636363,0.0871969696969697,0.5731565656565657,1
79,79,Improvements of diffractive optical element uniformity and zero order performance using lithographic process parameter optimization method," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Diffractive optical elements developed based on divergent light illumination enable a much broader range of applications compared to those designed based on plane wave approximation model. This is due to their easier module process, lower mass production cost and higher integration reliability. Multi-level phase stages and small design resolution are essential to achieve good design properties, but on the contrary, they increase the complication of simulation and fabrication and hence the gap between them. In this paper, a design performance approaching method using lithography process parameter optimization is proposed and verified in both simulation and fabrication. This method is firstly reported and systematically analyzed in this paper to our knowledge. Basing on 22°∗22° divergent light illumination model, a 9∗9 spot array pattern with diagonal Field of View 72.34° was designed with eight level phase stages ranging from 0 to 7π/4. Master wafers were fabricated through repeatable stepper lithography and plasma dry etch. Nano-imprinting (NIL) was implemented to duplicate DOE samples. DOE uniformity has been improved from 110.6.% to 90.9.% through process parameters optimization, with better center zero order intensity observed. It's most probably due to the optimization of phase stage shift from the pattern mis-order in fabrication process.

An effective parametric energy conversion can be observed when phase matching conditions between the waves are satisfied. The basic theoretical investigations are focused on efficiency of the four-photon mixing and parametric gain with applications such as all-optical signal sampling, time-demultiplexing, pulse generation and wavelength conversion. The parametric amplifiers have capacity to provide high gain and low noise at arbitrary wavelengths with proper fiber design and pump wavelength allocation. The problem with the generation of new frequencies on distances less than one coherent length in the process of parametric four-photon mixing was solved in approximation of fixed electric field of the pump wave. The idea of our research is to solve the more general problem in which it is taken into account the mutual action of the first and second order of dispersion and all real χ(3) nonlinear processes on the parametric four-photon mixing. In CW regime the solutions of the problem, presented above, was solved in the form of Jacobi elliptic functions.

93,93,An innovative safety-neutral slot overloading technique to improve airspace capacity utilisation: Innovative enhancements for CASA to optimise the network delay," All rights reserved.This paper presents a new air traffic flow and capacity management (ATFCM) technique that uses some of the rules and mechanisms that are already existing in the computer-assisted slot allocation (CASA) system, such as slot overloading and compensation of overloaded slots, in a new innovative manner that could potentially allow airspace capacity to be used more effectively, thus reducing the network delay and the impact of ATFCM delays on airspace users (AUs) schedules and costs. This new ATFCM technique has been named Resourceful Overloading of Slots (ROS). The early validation of ROS has been achieved through fast-time simulations using the R-NEST tool –an ATFCM simulation developed by the EUROCONTROL Experimental Centre–, and using a realistic scenario of 28 days (i.e. an AIRAC) from Summer 2018 in which more delay was recorded. The preliminary simulation results indicate that the ATFCM delay in that period could have been 23% lower, and the impact of delay 27% lower, compared to the same scenario simulated with the baseline CASA (i.e. default slot sequences calculated by a non-operational CASA module in R-NEST). The new ROS technique has also been analysed in combination with an existing innovative ATFCM technique, referred to in this paper as the Mitigation of Interacting Regulations (MIR), which was proposed in a recent paper as a means of enhancing CASA. The results of the simulations in which the two techniques were applied jointly are promising: ATFCM delay could be reduced, at least in the simulation setting, by 41% on average and the impact of delay by 55% on average.",60083823,EUROCONTROL Experimental Centre,Bretigny-sur-Orge,France,['1706'],32.5,0.17327823691460056,0.5193870523415979,0

When propagating underwater, the polarization state of laser will be changed in case of collision with the particles suspended in water. The linearly polarized laser will gradually become non-polarized due to depolarization, and the depolarization degree is related to the suspended particles. In order to detect the depolarization effect of waters, two orthogonal polarization receiving channels have been assembled in the MUPRMI system. For signal receiving, a photomultiplier tube has been assembled in each of the channels. By detecting the change of polarization state, parameters of scattering particles suspended in water in the detecting area can be inverted using inversion algorithm.

Degranulation of MCs is not only related to anaphylaxis, but also plays an important role in the formation and progression of tumor.

In this paper, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was used to detect and analyze the degranulation degree of MCs treated with different concentrations of C48/80 (compound 48/80, a mast cell activator). The culture supernatants of cells treated with different concentrations of C48/80 (0 μg/mL, 2 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL) were mixed with Ag colloids and high quality SERS spectra were acquired. The assignment of SERS bands combined with differential spectra analysis indicated that biomolecules associated with cell degranulation in the C48/80 treated groups were changed compared with the control group, including a decrease in the percentage of lipid content and an increase in the relative contents of collegen and phosphatidylserine. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) diagnostic algorithms were employed to analyze and distinguish the SERS spectra of different cell degranulation groups with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

104,104,3-D super-resolution localization microscopy using deep-learning method,"Super-resolution localization microscopy (SRLM) techniques overcome the diffraction limit, making possible the observation of sub-cellular structures in vivo. At present, the spatial resolution of ∼20 nm in x-y axis has been achieved in SRLM. However, the localization accuracy for the longitudinal axis (i.e., the z-axis) still need be improved. Although some methods have been proposed to implement 3-D SRLM, these methods are computationally intensive and parameter dependent. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a new method based on deep learning, termed as dl- 3D-SRLM. By learning the mapping between a 2-D camera frame (i.e., the experimentally acquired image) and the true 3-D locations of fluorophores in the corresponding image region with a convolutional neural network (CNN), dl-3D-SRLM provides the possibility of implementing 3-D SRLM with a high localization accuracy, a fast data-processing speed, and a little human intervention. To evaluate the performance of dl-3D-SRLM, a series of numerical simulations are performed. The results show that when using dl-3D-SRLM, we can accurately resolve the 3-D location of fluorophores from the acquired 2-D images, even if under high fluorophores densities and low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. In addition, the complex 3-D structure can also be effectively imaged by dl-3D-SRLM. As a result, dl-3D-SRLM is more beneficial for 3D-SRLM imaging.",60023813,Shanghai University,Shanghai,China,['1706'],20.9,0.13242897727272726,0.4886174242424242,1
105,105,Research on visibility detection based on forward scattering technology,"Visibility is one of the important parameters of meteorological observation. Based on the principle of infrared forward scattering and phase-locked amplification, a self-stable visibility meter is designed. The transmitter unit of visibility meter generates 875 nm light pulse at 2.3 kHz. Narrow pulse modulation technology is used to solve the problem of total power and instantaneous power of infrared LED when working, as well as the problem of natural heat dissipation, so as to reduce the aging speed of LED. The photodiode of the backscattering receiver monitors the transmitted light intensity, and adjusts the automatic feedback and the amplitude of the light pulse to keep the light intensity of the LED as the preset value. The visibility meter is compared with Visala PWD20 in the visibility measurement and verification laboratory. The experimental results show that the measurement deviations of one minute and ten minutes are within ±10% and ±4% in the range of 10∼20000m.

107,107,A communicative robot to learn about us and the world," All rights reserved.We describe a model for a robot that learns about the world and her companions through natural language communication. The model supports open-domain learning, where the robot has a drive to learn about new concepts, new friends, and new properties of friends and concept instances. The robot tries to fill gaps, resolve uncertainties and resolve conflicts. The absorbed knowledge consists of everything people tell her, the situations and objects she perceives and whatever she finds on the web. The results of her interactions and perceptions are kept in an RDF triple store to enable reasoning over her knowledge and experiences. The robot uses a theory of mind to keep track of who said what, when and where. Accumulating knowledge results in complex states to which the robot needs to respond. In this paper, we look into two specific aspects of such complex knowledge states: 1) reflecting on the status of the knowledge acquired through a new notion of thoughts and 2) defining the context during which knowledge is acquired. Thoughts form the basis for drives on which the robot communicates. We capture episodic contexts to keep instances of objects apart across different locations, which results in differentiating the acquired knowledge over specific encounters. Both aspects make the communication more dynamic and result in more initiatives by the robot.",60008734,Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,Amsterdam,Netherlands,['1706'],20.09090909090909,0.07784090909090909,0.42717803030303025,0
108,108,Determination of cancer cells induced by secretagogues based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer,"Cancer cells secrete copious amounts of secretory granules, exosomes, proteases. Recently, studies reviewed that mast cells (MCs) play crucial roles in the growth, spread and metastasis of tumor. MCs are one of the earliest cell types to infiltrate developing tumors. MCs undergo degranulation in response to various stimuli and rapidly release diverse bioactive mediators, such as histamine, tryptase, serotonin, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which will tremendously affect the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the mechanisms between the secretion of MCs degranulation and tumor remain unclear. Therefore, we developed a nanobiosensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for the determination of P815 mast cells and HeLa cells by secretagogues. With the pep-FITC as an energy donor and reduced grapheme oxide (rGO) as an energy acceptor, the two parts assemble an efficient FRET biosensor through electrostatic and stacking interaction (interaction). Sensitized secretory cells can produce tryptase which would hydrolyze the specific cleavage site of the peptide, leading to ruin FRET system and then yield intensive fluorescence (FL) recovery of quenched FITC. Results showed that P815 cells are more sensitive and intense secretory than HeLa cells owing to more amount secretory mediators of P815 can change the microenvironment and further exacerbate the degree of degranulation in return. Our findings suggest that FRET biosensor have the ability to detect the extracellular dynamics of the cancer cells microenvironment. In addition, targeting mast cells may serve as a novel therapeutic scheme for cancer treatment and that inhibiting mast cell function may lead to tumor regression.",60018844,Fujian Normal University,Fuzhou,China,['1706'],22.727272727272727,0.14444444444444446,0.5895833333333333,1

Furthermore, they are dynamic in nature. As energy is sometimes in scarce supply for these networks, one of the foremost serious threats is, the Denial of Sleep (DeoS) attacks; such attacks fatigue the device nodes and reduce the device’s overall lifetime. The schemes for these networks proposed in the past do not offer optimal power energy consumption. Hence, in this paper, we present an Encryption and Authentication based Security Scheme (EASS) to combat DeoS attacks. EASS is based on the use of SHA and symmetric cryptography to prevent power draining attacks, thereby extending the lifetime of the sensor nodes of a power-constrained network. The proposed lightweight security scheme imposes low computational requirements, and performs better than other solutions found in the literature.

Applying gamification to the higher education career system aims to bring an atmosphere of fair competition among educators in achieving higher career positions in their career journey. In the game environment, the atmosphere of the competition can be present through the leaderboards. However, traditional leaderboards usually rank the players' achievements linearly on a pile of pages, limiting the overall view of the map of competition between educators.

112,112,Optimized holographic imaging with the MIM-based metasurface," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Metasurfaces, a type of metamaterials with ultrathin thickness, have drawn tremendous attention in recent years due to their extraordinary flexibility to manipulate the light at subwavelength scale. It is useful in implementing various optical functions with a set of elements. A typical application of the metasurface is the holographic imaging, and one key parameter for the realization of holographic imaging is its optical efficiency. In this paper, we demonstrate the optimized holographic imaging by using the metasurface coded with a combined phase distribution. Firstly, the phase hologram is generated by Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm and the blazed grating is formed by introducing a periodic linear phasegradient distribution. Then the phase profile of the hologram is superimposed with the phase of blazed grating to generate a new phase distribution. Benefiting from the advantage of high efficiency for the desired light-manipulation, the metasurface based on the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure with different geometric parameters was utilized to cover the phase shift of 0 to 2πfor encoding the generated phase distribution. The structure consists of a four-level quantized metallic Au nanorods elements separated by dielectric layers of SiO2 with the Au substrate, so a macro cell of our metasurface consists of 16 (=4× 4) subwavelength meta-atom, which are made of the Au nanorods with different width. The simulated far-filed patterns are calculated by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Compared to previous metasurface, our structure preferentially steer incident energy into the desired first order diffracted beam with the help of the equivalent of the blazed grating. And the optimized holographic imaging results could be achieved.",60001604,Ministry of Education China,Beijing,China,['1706'],24.363636363636363,0.10027629233511585,0.5089928698752227,0

The present report deals with kinetics of phase formation of nanocomposite consisting of thermotropic polymer liquid crystalline poly(heptane-1,7-dyil-biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxilate), P7MB, and 1 wt. % single wall carbon nanotubes. Excellent dispersion of nanotubes, proven by scanning electron microcopy, was achieved. It was due to separate ultrasonication of both constituents in solvent and consequent mixing. This approach resulted in excellent non-covalent bonding and formation of nanofibers with a diameter of about 150 nm. Investigation on kinetics of structural formation at different iso-and non-isothermal conditions was performed by means of differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that cooling down the isotropic melt state, a smectic phase transition takes place in a very short time for both-neat P7MB and the nanocomposite. At lower temperatures, there is a partial crystallization. The smetic phase formation happens in identical way in all cases. However, there is a considerable difference in the way of crystalline phase formation, originating from the special restrictions, introduced by the nanotubes.

Initially, the polymeric core was synthesized via dispersion polymerization between glycidyl methacrylate as a functional monomer and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate as a cross-linking agent. Then the ion imprinted layer was formed by grafting of 1-methylimidazole on the surface of the polymeric particles in presence of As(V) as a template ion.

The photoacoustic peak-to-peak values of glucose solutions with six different concentrations were obtained under the scanning wavelengths from 1300 nm to 2300nm. To obtain the characteristic wavelengths of glucose, the differential spectrals between the photoacoustic peak-to-peak spectrals with different concentrations and that of the pure water were firstly gotten. Then, the synergy interval partial least square (siPLS) algorithm was used to optimally choose the characteristic wavelengths of glucose. The mean method was used to pre-process the photoacoustic peak-to-peak data. The photoacoustic peak-to-peak spectrals of glucose were divided into different sub-intervals, and different components and different segments were chosen. In addition, different synergies of sub-intervals were test to get the maximum correction coefficients for the calibration samples. After computing and compare with each other, 30 sub-intervals, 7 components, 4 segments, and 3 synergies sub-intervals were chosen because the root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) and the prediction bias are least.

However, exponential moving average (EMA) method, a common background subtraction technique, does not handle such a situation very well because the fixed parameter constrains the updating of the estimated clutter. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive clutter suppression algorithm to adjust the parameter of EMA method under the background of time-varying clutter. The main idea is to adopt a low-complexity time-averaged variable forgetting factor (TAVFF) mechanism. The proposed algorithm is assessed with data recording measured background clutter and a simulated moving target.

128,128,Study on high sensitivity measurement method of hydrogen sulfide gas under long optical path,"The small amount of hydrogen sulfide gas generated during the oil exploitation process is enough to cause great harm to the human body and mining equipment. It is necessary to detect hydrogen sulfide gas timely and accurately. Based on the principle of spectral absorption, a new method for detecting the concentration of hydrogen sulfide gas with high sensitivity is studied. According to Lambert Beer's law, increasing the optical path can enhance the intensity of the absorbed signal, thereby proposing a method using a long path gas absorption cell and increasing the sensitivity of the system detection. The improved Herriot absorption cell is used to make multiple round trips of light in the air chamber, which can obtain a longer absorption path and improve detection accuracy. The chamber is designed and simulated to test the practicality and accuracy. The light source part uses a Bragg fiber grating to modulate the LED broadband light source into a narrow-band light source, thereby reducing cost and enhancing practicability. The obtained light source is modulated and filtered, and the reference optical path is set, and then the dual optical path difference method is combined to eliminate the systematic error caused by noise interference and source fluctuation. The second harmonic in output signal is extracted by the lock-in amplifier, and then the gas concentration is inverted. At the same time, an adaptive algorithm is used to maintain the stability of the light source temperature, which can avoid the effects of temperature changes. The simulation experiments show that the long-range high-sensitivity measurement method of hydrogen sulfide greatly improves the measurement accuracy, and can be effectively applied to the on-line accurate detection of low-concentration hydrogen sulfide gas.",60025094,Hebei University of Science and Technology,Shijiazhuang,China,['1706'],25.363636363636363,0.23897233201581028,0.5472266139657443,1

The interaction of different group operations contributes to the confusion required for a secure cipher. However, IDEA has weak key classes which hindered in the faultless security of the data. Some keys containing a large number of 0 bits produce weak encryption. The encryption process of the algorithm is not enough to ensure the security against brute force attack.

Marketers, for example, may recommend a certain colour for a new soda can because it 'pops' on Instagram; politicians may 'fine-tune' diction for different social demographics. This paper engages the need to strategise for such resonance by offering a method for automating opposition analysis (OA), a technique from semiotics used in marketing and literary analysis to plot objects of interest on oppositional axes. Central to our computational approach is a reframing of texts as proxies for thought and opposition as the product of oscillation in thought in response to those proxies, a model to which the contextual similarity information contained in word embeddings is relevant. We illustrate our approach with an analysis of texts on gun control from ProCon.org, implementing a three-step method to: 1) identify relatively prominent signifiers; 2) rank possible opposition pairs on prominence and contextual similarity scores; and 3) derive plot values for proxies on opposition pair axes.

ATCo scanning activities on the apron conceptually follow (a) object detection, (b) size estimation, (c) class recognition, and (d) identification, where “size” constitutes an essential distinctive visual feature. Hence, comparing different surveillance techniques can revert into judging the respective level of performance reached to solve these visual tasks per technology candidate. To that end, the presented quantitative comparison relies on performance indicators derived from a field experiment. Our results show that LiDAR excels Out-The-Window View at degraded visibility conditions judged as the safety-critical setting.

150,150,Simulation of near-infrared light propagation through the thorax of a neonate: Addressing the optimisation of source and detector positions for measuring lung oxygen content in preterm infants,"Gas in scattering media absorption spectroscopy shortly called GASMAS, is a tunable diode laser spectroscopic technique developed for the measurement of gas present in turbid media. The technique relies on the sharp and specific absorption lines of gases which enables sensitive measurements of gas concentrations in the presence of a scattering solid medium with much broader absorption features. The Biophotonics laboratory at Tyndall National Institute (Biophotonics@Tyndall) is currently exploring the clinical translation of GASMAS technology into the respiratory healthcare of neonates. In this study, we use computational tools to assess the potential gain in gas absorption signal. One of the challenges in the development of the GASMAS technique is to obtain a sufficiently good signal in the measurements, as the light attenuation is high in tissue and the lungs are interior organs. To have an estimation of the capabilities and limitations in this specific application of gas spectroscopy, we model the transmission of near infrared (NIR) light in tissue when a 760 nm source and a set of 68 detectors are placed in different locations over the thorax. We segmented the main organs of the thorax from anonymized DICOM images of a neonate. This is followed by the creation of 3D computational models to solve light propagation with the diffusion equation, and the modelling of light propagation through the thorax of an infant including optical properties of lung, heart, arteries, bone, muscle, trachea, fat and skin. Finally, we calculate a map of the optimal light source - detector configurations to obtain the highest signal from oxygen gas imprint in the lungs. The use of computational tools such as NIRFAST Slicer 2.0 for investigation and further understanding of the advantages and limitations of the technology is fundamental. Such simulations enable the recreation of different clinical scenarios and identification of the minimum requirements necessary to further improve the application and develop a bedside clinical device that can potentially be used for continuous monitoring of lung function and control of ventilator settings.

It is can be received in most of the world without restrictions. Extended coverage can be achieved with a network of low-cost receivers and satellites. However, the fact that ADS-B is designed to contain only a low number of aircraft states such as position and velocity poses a challenge for some trajectory-based studies, for example, using ADS-B data to study aircraft turns. To this extent, air traffic controllers commonly rely on Mode-S track and turn reports to gather additional information like bank angle and turn rates during turns. Unlike ADS-B, this data has a low update rate and is not always openly available for all researchers. In this paper, we propose methods that allow researchers to extract and analyze aircraft turn parameters from ADS-B data during offline flight analysis. The paper first discusses the dynamics of aircraft turns. Then, based on ADS-B trajectory data, several steps are designed to derive turn radius, bank angle, and turn rate of an aircraft.

However, the raw data usually need to be pre-processed. Few software programs specialize in pre-processing raw data generated by a variety of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Here, we present AUSPP, a Perl script-based pipeline for pre-processing and automatic mapping of NGS short reads. This pipeline encompasses quality control, adaptor trimming, collapsing of reads, structural RNA removal, length selection, read mapping, and normalized wiggle file creation. It facilitates the processing from raw data to genome mapping and is therefore a powerful tool for the steps before meta-analysis. Most importantly, since AUSPP has default processing pipeline settings for many types of NGS data, most of the time, users will simply need to provide the raw data and genome.

161,161,Characterization of human coronary atherosclerotic plaque using spectrum- and time-resolved multiphoton microscopy,"Cardiovascular disease, especially coronary heart disease (CHD) caused by coronary atherosclerosis, has been a leading cause of death world-wide. Traditional methods of diagnosing CHD, including coronary CT angiography and histopathological examination, are limited either by the low image resolution or time-consuming sample preparation. Spectrum- and time-resolved multiphoton microscopy has the potential to circumvent this problem because it can not only interrogate the three-dimensional structure of coronary arterial intima but also reveal its biochemical components at subcellular resolution. However, its clinical utility hasn't been thoroughly assessed. Here, we adopted a spectrum- and timeresolved multiphoton microscope to characterize unstained human coronary atherosclerotic plaque ex vivo. According to the fluorescence spectra, the collagen fibers and elastic fibers in the coronary arterial intima can be separated clearly. We also analyzed the changes in the relative content of collagen fibers and elastic fibers by calculating the ratio of these two kinds of fibers in normal and diseased coronary arterial wall and found that the coronary atherosclerotic plaque regions has a higher ratio compared to that of normal tissue. Finally, we assessed the biochemical variations in coronary atherosclerotic tissues by measuring the fluorescence lifetime and found a lower mean fluorescence lifetime in coronary atherosclerotic plaque. This study indicates that the spectrum- and time-resolved multiphoton microscopy has the potential to distinguish atherosclerotic plaque on the coronary arterial wall from normal tissues.",60069718,Guangdong General Hospital,Guangzhou,China,['1706'],24.88888888888889,-0.010819327731092433,0.6213935574229692,1

Teachers should be able to adapt technology into the teaching and learning process. Three non-intellectual elements that affect the degree of integration of technology into teaching and learning are attitude toward computer, computer anxiety and computer self-efficacy. The study investigated attitudes towards computer, computer anxiety and gender as determinants of computer self-efficacy among 2100 pre-service science, technology and mathematics (STM) teachers from the University of Lagos of Nigeria using the quantitative research method within the blueprint of the descriptive survey design.

Single particle tracking is the most important step to explore the relationship between the spatio-temporal dynamics of subcellular molecules and their functions. Although previous studies have developed single particle tracking algorithms to quantitatively analyze particle dynamics in cell, traditional tracking methods have poor performance when dealing with intersecting trajectories. This can be attributed to two main reasons: 1) They do not have point compensation process for overlapping points; 2) They use inefficient motion prediction models. In this paper, we presented a novel Fan-shaped Tracker (FsT) algorithm to reconstruct the trajectories of subcellular molecules in living cells. We proposed a customized point compensation method for overlapping points based on the fan-shape motion trend of the particles to solve the merging trajectory problem. Furthermore, we compared the performance of our Fan-shaped Tracker with five state-of-the-art tracking algorithms in simulated time-lapse movies with variable imaging quality. Our results showed that the Fan-shaped Tracker achieves better performance than other reported methods as we systematically evaluated using a set of standard evaluation parameters.

Many simulators support System Biology Markup Language SBML; however, since the definition of the algebraic equations (AssignmentRule) and the events are made through an interface that is distinct from the definition of the reaction steps, there are tough works to define them. Accordingly, we have developed a new version of WinBEST-KIT that allows users to define the algebraic equations and the events through the same interface as those used in the definition of the reaction steps and customize them as GUI components appearing in the symbol selection area. The customized algebraic equations and events can thus be visually arranged at any time and any place. It also allows users to easily understand the roles of the algebraic equations and the events.

169,169,Tracking without bells and whistles,"The problem of tracking multiple objects in a video sequence poses several challenging tasks. For tracking-by-detection, these include object re-identification, motion prediction and dealing with occlusions. We present a tracker (without bells and whistles) that accomplishes tracking without specifically targeting any of these tasks, in particular, we perform no training or optimization on tracking data. To this end, we exploit the bounding box regression of an object detector to predict the position of an object in the next frame, thereby converting a detector into a Tracktor. We demonstrate the potential of Tracktor and provide a new state-of-the-art on three multi-object tracking benchmarks by extending it with a straightforward re-identification and camera motion compensation. We then perform an analysis on the performance and failure cases of several state-of-the-art tracking methods in comparison to our Tracktor. Surprisingly, none of the dedicated tracking methods are considerably better in dealing with complex tracking scenarios, namely, small and occluded objects or missing detections. However, our approach tackles most of the easy tracking scenarios. Therefore, we motivate our approach as a new tracking paradigm and point out promising future research directions.

One is a multi-channel ultrasonic sensor system using fiber ring laser based on erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) as the intensity demodulator. And another is a one-way amplified system based on EDFA. When the external dynamic strains are applied on the FBG sensor, the central wavelength of the FBG will move between two adjacent channels of the AWG. Therefore, the modulation of the central wavelength of the FBG is converted to the amplitude modulation of the output of the two adjacent channels.

While other researchers have proposed solutions to the runway balancing problem using a simulation-based technique to calculate aircraft delay, the proposed method replaces the simulation by a neural network model-based estimation using the actual operational data, thus providing the following two advantages. First, accurate estimation of aircraft delay can improve the solution of the runway balancing problem. Second, the simulation process is not required in the optimization. Although it is difficult to develop an accurate simulation model especially under uncertain environment, the neural network model can estimate the average delay without explicitly modeling uncertainty. In this paper, as a first step, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations. First, simulations considering uncertainty are used to generate the data, which are then used to train the neural network. The neural network predicts the delay under the current traffic and only this predicted delay is used for the runway balancing optimization with simulated annealing. The simulation result shows that the result by neural network outperforms the one by the simulation-based method under uncertainty. This means that the neural network can accurately estimate the delay under uncertainty environment, and is applicable in the optimization process.",60083826,Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile,Toulouse,France,['1706'],21.8,0.08196022727272728,0.4830965909090909,0

But imaging speed hinders their final clinical translation, considering necessary blood flush or balloon blood blockage operations during the intravascular intervention. In this study, we developed a high-speed IVPA system based on a 1064 nm pulsed laser, with the imaging speed of 60 round/second, about twice speed of the fastest IVPA system. In this system, a 0.9 mm outer diameter catheter was used for simultaneous IVPA and IVUS imaging. A plastic tube with an outer diameter of 1.3 mm was wrapped on the outside of the imaging catheter for protection and blood flushing channels. Firstly, the capability of high-speed imaging was verified by the imaging of a manually moving metal needle. Photoacoustic and ultrasonic images of the needle were obtained. No artifacts were found during the real-time imaging of the needle, which was unavoidable in the low-speed imaging system.

174,174,Cache side-channel attacks: Flush+flush and the countermeasures time gap,"In cloud computing, profitability among others, is the driving force that encourages full utilization of computing resources. Hence, scenarios where one or more users are co-located on the same CPU but on different virtual machines are normal. Even though this setting brings profitability, unfortunately it also brings security and privacy issues. Software-based sand-boxing techniques are not perfect, as a result, users through the shared memory of an application, can leak secret information. To tackle this problem, some work has been published proving how it is possible to detect cache side-channel attacks using HPCs (Hardware Performance Counters). However, this particular method of detection may only be effective for cache side-channel attacks that cause a lot of cache activity, especially in the form of cache misses, among others. Using HPCs, we observe that the Firefox Web Browser (a benign application) causes more page-faults and cache misses among others, in comparison with the FLUSH+FLUSH, FLUSH+RELOAD and PRIME+PROBE in our attack. In this paper, we focus on using the FLUSH+FLUSH method of cache side-channel attacks, to distinguish between input against the Links text-based browser in order to gain private information about last visited websites. Because the FLUSH+FLUSH attack method causes little or no cache misses, as a result, the attack is more stealthy and in some cases more accurate compared to the state of the art FLUSH+RELOAD attack method. We make the assumption that both the victim and the adversary are co-located on the same CPU but on different virtual machines and different cores, and that they have the same application installed, then through the shared memory of the application, the attack is made possible.

175,175,KPaM: A Key Protection Framework for Mobile Devices Based on Two-party Computation,"Key protection on mobile devices is attracting more attention with the rapid growth of mobile payment. There are many key protection methods proposed in academia from the following three aspects. The first is from algorithmic perspective, such as white-box cryptography. The second is from physical protection perspective, such as secure element (SE). The last is from key escrow perspective, such as cloud secure element (Cloud SE). The security of the white box cryptography has not yet reached an agreement in academia, and SE cannot defend against unknown side channel attacks in the future since it can hardly be updated. With regard to Cloud SE, the user has to totally trust the cloud, including the cloud provider, the cloud environment, etc. However, with the development of attack methods, the complete credibility of the cloud has gradually become an excessive requirement.In this paper, we propose KPaM, a low-cost and flexible key protection framework for mobile devices, which can mitigate the issues described above. The main idea of KPaM is inspired by emerging two-party computation algorithm. The private key is split into two parts, stored and used in the mobile device and the cloud respectively. The cloud does not store the complete key, so there is no need to worry about the abuse of the user's private key. On the mobile side, we get rid of SE and use TEE (trusted execution environment) to perform cryptographic operations and access control mechanism, which realizes the functions of secure storage and trust path.

Hence many popular open-source frameworks for large-scale data processing have been used to deal with iterative machine learning tasks due to the efficient parallel computation and the in-memory abstraction. In this paper we first propose KerTSDroid, a novel Android malware detection framework, to predict the malicious applications in parallel through kernel task structures in Android kernel layer. Then a data provider is orchestrated and implemented to construct the real-world dataset of 112 kernel features from 12,750 Android applications. A parallel predictor is also provided to identify Android malicious applications. Our experiments demonstrate that a Decision Tree method of KerTSDroid can achieve the best precision rate (96%-99%) with a lower overhead on average, the other three methods (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine) lead to lower precision rate while discriminating abnormal behaviors with the in-memory parallel-data.",60022422,Ocean University of China,Qingdao,China,['1708'],26.0,0.11000000000000001,0.44333333333333336,1

In that cases, the restoration of power needs to be carried out immediately in order to guarantee the system’s reliability. The power flow path identification is considered as a difficult task especially in a huge system due to large number of switches. Kruskal’s algorithm is presented in this paper to find the minimum power flow path in a power distribution network. The comparison of performance between presented Kruskal’s algorithm and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) was made in solving a problem regarding network reconfiguration. The proposed load restoration approach is tested on IEEE 33-bus single feeder radial distribution system using MATLAB software. From the results, it is found that the presented Kruskal’s algorithm was able to search for the minimal power flow path that contribute to loss reduction for power restoration after the occurrence of fault.",60004351,Universiti Teknologi MARA,Shah Alam,Malaysia,"['1711', '1710', '1708', '1705']",25.142857142857142,0.05178571428571431,0.5542857142857143,0

One such means, dynamic airspace configuration (DAC) proposes moving from fixed, static airspace configurations to configurations that dynamically adapt to changes in traffic amount and patterns. Whiles several different DAC solutions have been proposed and evaluated, little is known about the acceptability of DAC approaches to their end users. The work reported in this paper focuses on Air Traffic Controllers' (ATCOs’) acceptance of DAC. To address this, we developed a prototype controller working position (CWP) that supports ATCOs in understanding changes in airspace configurations and their effect. We conducted a study with ATCOs controlling the Milan Air Traffic Control Centre using this CWP. To our knowledge, this is the first time DAC has been implemented in a CWP and tested with ATCOs.

With the SESAR deployment phase already progressing in Europe, there is a growing need to assess its real impact on ATM performance. Free Route Airspace (FRA) is one of the most widely implemented SESAR solutions in Europe. This paper aims at analyzing the actual effects of cross-border FRA implementation on safety performance, measured by the number of potential safety-related events and exposure to risk. One of the largest FRA in Europe-the Northern Europe Free Route Airspace (NEFRA)-has been selected as a showcase of the performance methodology proposed. It has been shown that FRA implementation had a positive impact on safety performance in NEFRA airspace, leading to a significant reduction in the number of potential separation losses (35%).

186,186,Please have a look here: Successful guidance of air traffic controller’s attention," All rights reserved.Keeping the operator’s attention on the right spot of the situation data display is one of the key factors to successfully guide air traffic. However, this becomes particularly difficult with complex and dense traffic situations displayed on larger screens. This paper describes our developed prototypic attention guidance (AG) system for air traffic controllers (ATCO). This system uses eye-tracking as an input for the ATCO’s current attention. Different attention guidance was implemented for specific air traffic control (ATC) events such as handover and conflict alerts. For those events, different visual cues are presented step-wise within various levels of escalation in case the ATCO did not pay attention to ATC events. The AG system was tested in human-in-the-loop validation trials with five ATCOs. The simulated Hungarian Flight-Centric airspace was chosen as a test-case. The validation trials revealed promising results for the Solution controller working position (CWP), which was equipped with AG functionality. ATCOs reported less workload and improved situation awareness with the Solution CWP than without AG support. Increased acceptance and confidence with the Solution system were also reported. ATCOs felt strongly supported by our robust and smoothly interacting attention guidance system encouraging further development of our prototype towards operational use.",60007798,Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- Und Raumfahrt,Cologne,Germany,['1706'],16.833333333333336,0.06328320802005011,0.5110902255639097,0
187,187,Flight data monitoring (FDM) unknown hazards detection during approach phase using clustering techniques and autoencoders," All rights reserved.Airlines safety departments analyse aircraft data recorded on-board (FDM) to inspect safety occurrences. This activity relies on human experts to create a rule-based system that detects known safety issues, based on whether a small set of parameters exceed some predefined set of thresholds. However, rare events are the hardest to manually detect, as patterns are not often recognised at glance. Experts agree that both approach and take-off procedures are more prone to experience a safety incident. In this paper we performed descriptive and predictive analyses to detect anomalies during approach phase for runway 25R in LEBL airport. From a descriptive point of view, clustering techniques aids to find patterns and correlations within data, and also to identify clusters of similar observations. Moreover, this clusters might reveal certain points as rare events that are isolated from the rest of the observations. Predictive analytics, and more concisely deep learning ANN and AutoEncoders, can be used to detect this abnormal events. The methodology relies on learning how ”normal” observations looks like, since they usually are the majority of the cases. Afterwards, if we process an abnormal flight, the model will return a high reconstruction error because of the deviation from the training data. This shows how the predictive methodology could be applied as an extremely useful forensic tool for safety experts and FDM analysts.",60019722,Technical University of Munich,Munich,Germany,['1706'],20.363636363636363,0.148021978021978,0.47010989010989007,0

195,195,Mid-infrared vector beams in selenide photonic crystal fiber with small hollow core and its application on supercontinuum generation,"Characteristics of vector beams in mid-infrared waveband are analyzed numerically in an As2Se3 photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with small central hollow core (SCHH), including the mode fields, confinement loss, effective refractive index and chromatic dispersion. In the PCFs with the SCHH diameter d0 of 0-1.5 μm, the confinement losses of the four vector beams (HE11, TM01, TE01, and HE21) are smaller than 1.0 dB/m for the wavelengths up to ∼5 μm. For the SCHH diameter d0 of 0.5-1.5 μm, the field enhancement of the HE11mode occurs in the SCHHs in the central area for the wavelengths ≤ 5 μm. This happens because the evanescent light penetrates into the SCHH. With d0 increasing, the effective refractive index separations (δneff) between the HE11mode and high-order modes (TM01, TE01, and HE21) decreases, while the δneffamong the high-order modes increases. At the wavelength of 5 μm, the δneff of HE11-TE01, TE01-HE21, and HE21-TM01 is 0.03098, 0.03960, and 0.06867, respectively, when d0 is 1.5 μm. The second ZDWs of TE01, HE21 and TM01mode are blueshifted with the increase of d0, but they are longer than 5 μm. The negative dispersion regions of the high-order modes (TE01, HE21, and TM01) are much wider than the HE11 modes. With the increase of d0, the HE11 mode dispersion curves have no obvious change, while the high-order modes (TE01, HE21, and TM01) dispersion curves become steep at the longer wavelength, the TM01 mode changes most obviously, and the depression appears. To demonstrate the application of the PCF, super-continuum generation pumped by the four vector modes are simulated and analyzed.

A specific mining system was analysed as a case study and a maximum savings scenario was determined, using the methodology formulated. The maximum savings scenario schedule change resulted in a 1.3% cost reduction. System improvements had an additional potential reduction effect of 8.4%, which was primarily the result of a reduction in compressors' power consumption. The implications of the proposed schedule adjustments necessitated a realistic scenario. The realistic scenario had an effective financial reduction of 0.7%.

So the aim of this paper, so as steering for future analysis associated with supply chains in construction, is to review existing analysis and synthesize main approaches and findings. especially, this review seeks to screen existing studies (published in amount 2010-2018 mistreatment Pro Quest database) with respect to their a) level of research, b) analysis focus, c) variety of study/paper, d) the sample used, e) analyzed relationships, and f) the various varieties of construction subjects that are coated and linked into supply chains.",60021005,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,Johor Bahru,Malaysia,"['1710', '1706']",36.833333333333336,0.10520050125313284,0.362531328320802,0
204,204,Feature extraction based on frame interval for wireless network devices,"The development of wireless communication technology has brought great convenience to our lives, however, in the fields of military communications, remote signal control and wireless signal transmissions, we still face huge challenges. Based on the problems above, some researchers extract features from the time domain and the frequency domain of the transient and steady-state part of the wireless signal separately, ultimately achieved the purpose of identification individual wireless network devices; some researchers extract the features of the wireless frames by parsing the IEEE802.11 protocols, and the method can also achieve the purpose of identifying wireless network devices. For the steady-state part of the wireless signal, it needs high-precision equipments for data acquisition, and the volume of data obtained is very large. As for the transient part of the wireless signal, it has a very short duration, conventional equipment can hardly meet the requirements. The method by parsing the wireless frames and then extracting the frame interval is also very inefficient, it has some limitations for parameter acquisition. In this paper, we proposed a method which takes frame interval as a fingerprint to represent wireless device, this method eliminates the need for high-precision equipments, at the same time, it avoids the demands to parse the IEEE802.11 protocols. Using this method, we can quickly and easily get data whose volume is quite small without expensive equipment. Probability density curves are used in this paper to represent the signature. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the identification of IEEE802.11 wireless network devices, and the average recognition rate reaches 95%.",60010421,Southwest Jiaotong University,Chengdu,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",29.0,0.08053571428571431,0.4877142857142857,1

The complexity of the low-level internals of big data frameworks and the ubiquity of application and workload configuration parameters makes it challenging and expensive to come up with comprehensive performance modelling solutions. In this paper, instead of focusing on a wide range of configurable parameters, we studied the low-level internals of the MapReduce communication pattern and used a minimal set of performance drivers to develop a set of phase level parametric models for approximating the execution time of a given application on a given cluster. Models can be used to infer the performance of unseen applications and approximate their performance when an arbitrary dataset is used as input. Our approach is validated by running empirical experiments in two setups.

207,207,The Sickle Cell Disease Ontology: Enabling universal sickle cell-based knowledge representation,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic diseases in humans with multiple phenotypic expressions that can manifest as both acute and chronic complications. Although described more than a century ago, challenges in comprehensive disease management and collaborative research on this disease are compounded by the complex molecular and clinical phenotypes of SCD, environmental and psychosocial factors, limited therapeutic options and ambiguous terminology. This ambiguous terminology has hampered the integration and interoperability of existing SCD knowledge, and SCD research translation. The SCD Ontology (SCDO), which is a community-driven integrative and universal knowledge representation system for SCD, overcomes this issue by providing a controlled vocabulary developed by a group of experts in both SCD and ontology design. SCDO is the first and most comprehensive standardized humanand machine-readable resource that unambiguously represents terminology and concepts about SCD for researchers, patients and clinicians. It is built around the central concept 'hemoglobinopathy', allowing inclusion of non-SCD haemoglobinopathies, such as thalassaemias, which may interfere with or influence SCD phenotypic manifestations. This collaboratively developed ontology constitutes a comprehensive knowledge management system and standardized terminology of various SCD-related factors. The SCDO will promote interoperability of different research datasets, facilitate seamless data sharing and collaborations, including meta-analyses within the SCD community, and support the development and curation of data-basing and clinical informatics in SCD.",60091726,Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences,Dar Es Salaam,Tanzania,['1710'],27.375,0.11638655462184876,0.3721288515406162,1

Such an architecture has been the choice for its structural advantages over DHT-based architectures. It is worth mentioning its most important advantage from the viewpoint of speed of communication, that is its diameter, which is only 3 overlay hops. The protocol is not restricted to a single data source and it incorporates peer heterogeneity as well. We have also designed another any source capacity-constrained multicast protocol that incorporates the unique idea of transforming the multicast problem to a broadcast one [10]. We have compared analytically the performance of the two protocols; it has led to the observation that use of this unique idea [10] cannot take advantage of all structural advantages of a CRT-based system resulting in decrease in performance.

To customize the configuration of a blockchain application, an operator needs the performance characteristics of a blockchain network in different Cloud environments. However, manually profiling the performance characteristics of a blockchain network is very time-consuming. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a BlockchaIn-infRAstructure CustomIzation and Auto-profiLing (BIRACIAL) framework to automate the whole process of blockchain deployment and performance profiling. Based on the profile and performance requirements of a blockchain application, the framework aims to plan the virtual infrastructure for permissioned blockchain, to automate the provision of the required infrastructure, to deploy the customized permissioned blockchain, and to enable continuous monitoring of blockchain performance.

214,214,Time-related constraints in administration shell design within cyber-physical production systems,"The concept of Cyber-physical Production System has recently emerged. It emphasizes the expected and very close connection between industrial software systems and production assets on the next generation of intelligent industrial systems. The cyber-physical conceptualization hints at assets making their functions available through the so called administration shells. These are software structural design tenets that from, a functional perspective, will not only incorporate software interfacing aspects but also autonomous behaviour. There is an important body of practice in what is now perceived as cyber-physical integration. However, such work has taken a somehow informal approach to formalizing system engineering aspects and in particular to the impact of time-related constraints affecting, the design locally and, the CPPS as a whole. This paper provides a model that relates physical, logical and computational aspects of cyber-physical design from structural and behavioural perspectives. Its goal is to provide a starting point for designing cyber-physical components while supporting informed decision making in respect to software design, integration and deployment practices that enable these components to operate in cyber-physical synchronization.",60009358,Linköpings universitet,Linkoping,Sweden,"['1706', '1710']",21.625,0.17450980392156865,0.40742296918767507,1

216,216,Feature selection and recognition of multivariate physiological signals using binary firefly algorithm,"Interest in pattern recognition of physiological signals is growing in recent years due to the rapid development of telemedicine and the Internet of Things. However, on account of high dimensionality, multivariate, and the large amount of data, feature extraction and selection of multiple physiological signals is still a hard nut to crack in pattern recognition. Therefore, a measuring experiment of multivariate physiological signals before and after physical exercises was firstly carried out. Signals of electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure and oxygen saturation are simultaneously measured for 30 subjects. Moreover, multivariate physiological signals are in turn processed by filtering, segmentation and morphological feature extraction based on heartbeat samples. A novel binary firefly algorithm (NBFA) is proposed in this paper to realize the automatic feature selection for multiple physiological signals. The NBFA evaluates each binary firefly according to both classification accuracy and the number of features. The movement of a firefly is updated by a bit conversion factor and a random mounting flying step. High classification results of 30 subjects show that morphological features can depict main characteristics of 12-lead ECG signals. The NBFA performs superior to the PCA, PSO in the feature selection of multiple physiological signals. It can quickly find the small number of features as well as obtain high classification, which further reduces the computation load and data storage capacity in pattern recognition of multiple physiological signals.",60022279,Shanghai Normal University,Shanghai,China,"['1706', '1710']",20.636363636363637,0.05145363408521303,0.35919799498746874,1

Traditional approaches in this field mostly rely on harnessing statistical methods into processing medical data like genes, MRI images, demographics, etc. Latest advances of machine learning techniques grant another chance of training disease progression models for AD. This trend leads on exploring and designing new machine learning techniques towards multi-modality medical and health dataset for predicting occurrences and modeling progression of AD. This paper aims at giving a systemic survey on summarizing and comparing several mainstream techniques for AD progression modeling, and discuss the potential and limitations of these techniques in practical applications. We summarize three key techniques for modeling AD progression: multi-task model, time series model and deep learning.

One of the barriers to overcome is to handle appropriately the uncertainty propagation across manufacturing lines, that hinder the development of accurate control systems. Within this framework, we introduce a non-intrusive method for uncertainty management that relies on a Monte Carlo approach building on a deterministic parametric real-time simulation model. The real-time simulation model is a Reduced Order Model (ROM) based on a generalized Canonical Polyadic Decomposition. The method is introduced using an industrial test case as demonstrator, namely car door/body seals manufacturing by means of continuous coextrusion of a metal strip and various types of rubber.

220,220,"Modelling of airborne pollen dispersion in the atmosphere in the Catalonia region, Spain: Model description, emission scheme and evaluation of model performance for the case of Pinus","Pollination is a biologically-relevant process that affects the structure of ecosystems since pollen contributes to determine the spatial distribution of plant species. It is thus of interest for mapping ecosystem services for policy support and decision making to increase our knowledge of pollen grain behavior in the atmosphere (source, emission, processes involved during their transport, etc.) at fine temporal and spatial scales. First simulations with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center MONARCH dispersion model (known before as NMMB/BSC-CTM) of Pinus pollen in the atmosphere were performed during a 5-day pollination event observed in Barcelona, Spain, between 27-31 March, 2015. MONARCH is an online atmospheric composition model that solves the life cycle of water vapor, gases and aerosols within a meteorological model. A new aerosol emission scheme for pollen grains has been implemented in the system. The emission scheme considers wind speed at 10 m, friction velocity, and temperature and specific humidity at 2 m as main drivers of the mobilization of Pinus pollen grains. The meteorological information is available for the emission scheme at each meteorological integration time step. The spatial distribution of the pine species (P. halepensis, P. pinea) that pollinate from February to April in Catalonia has been derived from the Cartography of habitats of Catalonia and the tree density was obtained from the Forest Inventory of Catalonia. A domain over north-east Spain at 9 km x 9 km horizontal resolution covering Catalonia is designed with 48 vertical layers. The initial and boundary meteorological conditions are derived from the fifth major global ECMWF ReAnalysis (ERA-5). To evaluate the model performances, the simulations are compared (i) to groundbased concentration measurements performed with a Hirst collector in Barcelona downtown, and (ii) to vertically-resolved measurements performed 4 km west of Barcelona downtown with a Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL). A method based on the lidar polarization capabilities was used to retrieve the contribution of the pollen to the total signal. The conversion from optical lidar-retrieved properties to concentration was optimized by minimizing the sum of the squared deviations between the lidar-retrieved concentration at the first height and the true (Hirst) concentration measured at the ground. In terms of surface concentration, the simulation performs well during the center of the event with major underestimation at the beginning. As far as the vertical distribution of airborne Pinus pollen is concerned, simulations reproduce well the shape of the profiles but the intensity tends to be underestimated. Three major limitations are identified with the model runs: (1) the poorly known phenology emission function, (2) the temporal development of the convective planetary boundary layer in coastal areas, which directly affects the vertical structure of the pollen dispersion; (3) the development of the sea breeze and a proper representation of the sea coast line, that play a significant role on the skills of the meteorological mesoscale model.",60007592,Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya,Barcelona,Spain,['1706'],25.944444444444443,0.060095520421607374,0.41541501976284584,1

These sources are present in different sites, including megacities like São Paulo that are growing in size and economic activity. At the same time, there is a remarkable growth in concerns about the environmental issues associated with these activities. In a constantly changing world, with increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), among them methane (CH4) and volatile organic compounds (VOC), mitigation of atmospheric emission of these gases to contain global warming, make field campaigns in the metropolitan region of São Paulo very relevant. Optical remote sensing techniques as lidar can attend the need for real time and trustable information on fugitive emissions. The Cavity Ringdown Laser Spectroscopy (CRDS) technique was adopted because it is widely used in the detection of gas samples that absorb light at specific wavelengths and also for their ability to detect mole fractions up to the parts per trillion level.

However, the intensity of UCPL is often not high enough for practical applications, because of very weak absorption cross-section at the pump wavelength due to the parity forbidden intra-4f shell transitions of RE ions. One promising approach for the enhancement of UCPL efficiency is exploiting the coupling of RE-doped upconverters with surface plasmon resonance of a metal nanostructure. In this paper, we report lithographically fabricated two-dimensional square lattice of Al nanocylinders combined with nanoparticles layer of CaF2 codoped with Er3+,Yb3+ that shows enhanced UCPL. We systematically vary the periodicity of the lattice and examine the UCPL enhancement. The maximum UCPL enhancement is observed at a period of 750 nm, showing 22 and 13.3-fold enhancements for green and red emission branches, respectively.

The complexity and diversity of factories, combined with the continuing discovery of new data-driven solutions, poses a challenge for practitioners to thoroughly determine where, which, and how data should be processed. This, however, is crucial for deciding how and whether to invest in EC. This paper proposes a multiphase concept for the systematic assessment of whether and where EC is most beneficial in a given production environment. It is comprised of human and machine interpretable functions. Combining multiple functions leads to a data-driven solution, which forms links between the data sources (assets) of a production environment and the desired outcome (goals). Four main criteria for EC are derived to enable the exposure of areas with increased EC potential, forming the baseline for a scoring system.

Optical arrangement, sensors, and embedded electronics often limit the accuracy of the representation. Scenes with a dynamic range above the capability of the camera or poor lighting are challenging conditions, which usually result in low contrast images. Soft clipping is usually compensated by transforming the power and shifting the image's histogram. However, under extreme conditions, ill exposure results in severe clipping that requires interpolation and painting. We introduce a model of convolutional neural network to perform signal reconstruction and interpolation. It is designed to be used on sRGB images.

While satisfying the stereoscopic perception, it greatly reduces the storage space of data and alleviates the large attenuation of resolution caused by integrated imaging. However, at present, there is no 3D film source suitable for a one-dimensional integrated imaging system. In order to address this problem, we propose an array image generation and padding algorithm based on a one-dimensional integrated imaging system. First, based on the theory of geometric optics and DIBR(Depth-image Based Rendering), we use depth maps to simulate viewpoint images at arbitrary locations. In the process, we classify the points mapped to the viewpoint image to make the generated viewpoint image more accurate. Secondly, when conducting hole filling, we first use the optical flow method to fill the large holes inside the image. We extract the edge of the hole, compare the depth values on both sides of the edge, and estimate the depth value of the hole by taking the optical flow value on the larger side, so as to calculate the mapping block of the hole on the reference frame.

Conventional techniques used by the radiologists for nodule detection in CT images is time-consuming and inefficient; to assist in the diagnosis process and further enhance its efficiency and accuracy, decision support systems have been developed in the past few years. In our paper, we proposed a Multi-Dimension Region-based Fully Convolutional Network based decision support system for detection and classification of lung nodule.

244,244,Reducing simulator sickness with perceptual camera control," All rights reserved.Virtual-reality provides an immersive environment but can induce cybersickness due to the discrepancy between visual and vestibular cues. To avoid this problem, the movement of the virtual camera needs to match the motion of the user in the real world. Unfortunately, this is usually difficult due to the mismatch between the size of the virtual environments and the space available to the users in the physical domain. The resulting constraints on the camera movement significantly hamper the adoption of virtual-reality headsets in many scenarios and make the design of the virtual environments very challenging. In this work, we study how the characteristics of the virtual camera movement (e.g., translational acceleration and rotational velocity) and the composition of the virtual environment (e.g., scene depth) contribute to perceived discomfort. Based on the results from our user experiments, we devise a computational model for predicting the magnitude of the discomfort for a given scene and camera trajectory. We further apply our model to a new path planning method which optimizes the input motion trajectory to reduce perceptual sickness. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method in improving perceptual comfort in a series of user studies targeting different applications. The results indicate that our method can reduce the perceived discomfort while maintaining the fidelity of the original navigation, and perform better than simpler alternatives.",60026415,Stony Brook University,Stony Brook,United States,['1704'],24.77777777777778,0.11789772727272727,0.5482751623376623,0

Usually, there are many difficulties in defining secrecy capacity, but we define vehicular secrecy capacity for the vehicle defined only by SNR values. Defined vehicular secrecy capacity is practical and efficient in achieving physical layer security in V2V. Typically, secrecy capacity may be changed by antenna related parameters, path related parameters, and noise related parameters. In addition to these conventional parameters, we address unique vehicle-related parameters, such as vehicle speed, safety distance, speed limit, response time, etc. in connection with autonomous driving. We confirm the relationship between vehicle-related secrecy parameters and secrecy capacity through modeling in highway and urban traffic situations. These vehicular secrecy parameters enable real-time control of vehicle secrecy capacity of V2V communications.

In this paper, we propose an automatic glacier discrimination approach named MSSUnet to address several key research issues. First, a spatial-spectral module is used to adaptively learning the feature from different spectral band and neighboring pixels, which can better learn spatial-spectral features and reduce the impact of noise. Second, a band fusion method is applied to achieve fusion of different resolution bands in Sentinel-2 and reduce the interference of additional information.

By either metric, we find higher registration rates among postal codes with greater prosperity or population density. However, we also find evidence of bias in IP geolocation: it makes greater errors, both geographically and economically, for users from more economically distressed areas; it disproportionately places users in prosperous areas; and it underestimates the regressive pattern in MOOC registration.

255,255,CO2 retrieval algorithm for the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer: The potential of retrieving the vertical profile of carbon dioxide from its hot or laser bands in the 800-1200 cm-1 atmospheric window,"In a series of recent papers we have developed and tested a full physical retrieval scheme for the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer or IASI, which is capable of simultaneously retrieving surface temperature, emissivity and atmospheric profiles of temperature, H2O, O3, HDO, CO2, N2O, CO, CH4, SO2, HNO3, NH3, OCS, CF4 atmospheric profiles. Until now, the performance of this scheme has concerned the column amount of gas species. In this paper, we will assess the capability of the methodology to retrieve the vertical profile of CO2. In this respect, the effectiveness of the method mostly relies on the degree of freedom (dof) of the retrieval. In principle, for an unconstrained Least Square approach, dof achieves its larger value and is equal to the number of layers, NL which is used to represent the vertical profile. Using Optimal Estimation we have dof ≤ NL and the actual value is determined by the background covariance matrix. In this study, we use a novel approach, which directly allows us to represent the CO2 profile with orthogonal eigenvectors or vertical modes that explain which fine-scale structures we can resolve with our retrieval. The number of vertical modes we can effectively resolve depends on the IASI information content for CO2. To check the capability of the scheme to retrieve the CO2 profile we have considered a retrieval exercise for a target area close to Mauna Loa and Cape Kumukahi validation stations in the Hawaii region. Five years of IASI data have been collected on such an area and processed according to the above methodology. It will be shown that IASI is capable of retrieving at most 2-3 information pieces or vertical modes for the CO2 vertical profile, which yield an accurate estimation of the CO2 total amount and the correct smooth shape expected for a long-lived species such as CO2 far from intense pollution sources.",60020919,Università degli Studi della Basilicata,Potenza,Italy,['1706'],28.09090909090909,0.125,0.4183150183150183,1
256,256,Anlysis and design of activity degree monitoring algorithm,"DAU (Daily Active User) is the number of daily active users, often used to reflect the operation of websites, Internet APPs and games [1]. DAU usually counts the number of users who have logged in or used a product (removing users who are repeatedly logged in) within one day (statistical day), which is similar to the concept of visitors (UV) in the traffic statistics tool. As we all know, the revenue source of some Internet applications lies in the revenue of advertising, and the amount of advertising revenue depends on the size of DAU. Therefore, the design strategy and algorithm to monitor the fluctuations of DAU can better help people analyze and improve our products, thus bringing improvements to the products.

Convolution neural network based on pedestrian detection models has gained enormous success in many applications. However, these models need a large amount of annotated and labeled datasets for training process which requires lots of time and human effort. For training samples, the diversity and quantity of datasets are very important. The proposed framework is based on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), able to generate realistic pedestrians. Experimental results show that DCGAN framework is able to synthesize real pedestrian images with diversity. The synthesized samples can be included in training data to improve the performance of pedestrian detectors. 24,770 images including PETA dataset, Inria dataset were used for the training process.",60017293,Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,Naples,Italy,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",16.375,0.2682913165266107,0.5465826330532213,1

Researchers show that DNN models can provide better traffic prediction accuracy than the traditional shallow models. Since the traffic flow reveals both spatial and temporal dependency characteristics, and may be impacted by weather, social event data etc., therefore, a set of hybrid DNN models have been presented recently in literature for further improving the traffic flow prediction performances. The hybrid models can capture dependency in multi-dimension and show better prediction performances than simple DNN models. This paper presents a thorough review and comparison of hybrid deep learning models for traffic flow prediction.

Semantic technologies have been used to enable interoperability as well as deal with the heterogeneity, massive scale, and dynamic nature of IoT resources. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, semantic technologies arise as a potential approach toward information modeling and dynamic reconfiguration of highly complex automation systems with high diversity of domains, protocols, tools or hardware platforms. Applying semantics into existing IoT frameworks requires a thorough understanding of the framework architectures as well as careful considerations of different semantic technologies. To support this process, we survey the literature on the contributions and usage of semantics in IoT. We find that semantics are mainly used to handle interoperable systems and heterogeneous standards. In this paper, we also propose procedures for applying semantics into IoT frameworks. Further, we present our idea of using semantics to enable dynamical orchestration of services within the Arrowhead Framework - an IoT framework that supports the development of industrial automation systems.",60101843,HØgskolen i Østfold,Halden,Norway,"['1706', '1710']",21.5,-0.006666666666666667,0.5187878787878787,1

Despite the high reconstruction quality, there are still challenges that need to be addressed ranging from variations in configuration parameters to high computational complexity. These drawbacks are crucial especially if the reconstructed models have to be used for quality check, inspection or repair in manufacturing environments where we have to deal with large objects resulting in very dense 3D meshes. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown that are able to automatically learn and find more accurate and reliable results, without the need for setting manually parameters. In this work, motivated by the aforementioned requirements, we propose a fast and reliable denoising method that can be effectively applied for reconstructing very dense noisy 3D models. The proposed method applies conditional variational autoencoders on face normals. Extensive evaluation studies carried out using a variety of 3D models verify that the proposed approach achieves plausible reconstruction outputs, very relative or even better of those proposed by the literature, in considerably faster execution times.",60042257,Industrial Systems Institute,Patra,Greece,"['1706', '1710']",24.428571428571427,0.21171428571428574,0.4725119047619047,1
261,261,HT-GSOM: Dynamic self-organizing map with transience for human activity recognition,"Recognition of complex human activities is a prominent area of research in intelligent video surveillance. The current state-of-the-art techniques are largely based on supervised deep learning algorithms. The inability to learn from unlabeled video streams is a key shortcoming in supervised techniques in most current applications where large volumes of unlabeled video data are utilized. Furthermore, the dominant focus on persistence in traditional machine learning algorithms has induced two limitations; the influence of outdated information in memory- guided decision making, and overfitting of acquired knowledge on specific past events, weakening the plasticity of the learning system. To address the above requirements, we propose a new adaptation of the Growing Self Organizing Map (GSOM), formed in a hierarchical two-stream learning pipeline to accommodate unlabeled video data for human activity recognition, which facilitates plasticity by implementing a transience property, without losing the stability of the learning system. The proposed model is evaluated using two benchmark video datasets, confirming its validity and usability for human activity recognition.",60011362,RMIT University,Melbourne,Australia,"['1706', '1710']",27.333333333333332,0.07447026657552973,0.445790612895876,1

Recently, Gao and Li (2017) have developed an empirical method for thin cirrus correction with focus on data provided by Landsat-8. This correction allows one to estimate clear-sky apparent reflectance. Validated qualitatively, we propose here a quantitative validation method using Sentinel-2 data by comparing the corrected image with a clear sky reference image. Their method shows good results on dark surfaces, like water, with an apparent reflectance found close to 0.02. On the other hand, it becomes less accurate for thicker cirrus and on more reflective surfaces. In addition, the data analysis shows that pixels located in the shadow of the cirrus are over-corrected. The downward path should therefore be taken into account when correcting the signal.",60102124,Université Fédérale Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées,Toulouse,France,['1706'],15.75,0.0898809523809524,0.38988095238095244,1

The specifics of using a noise distribution density of a noisy signal with a nonzero mathematical expectation for early monitoring of accidents of various technical objects are considered. The technologies of early monitoring of technical objects based on analysis of estimates of noise characteristics are developed. It is shown that to detect a defect occurrence on an early stage it is necessary to create a data bank consisting of these estimates obtained at different time instants and to conduct an analysis. Moreover, for each type of defect its own bank of informative features is compiled in which there is established a correspondence between the values of noise characteristics and degree of development of this type of defect. The matrix of informative features of development dynamics of each type of technological object malfunction is compiled. It is noted that construction of matrices of informative features for all possible type of technical objects malfunctions makes it possible to identify on the initial stage the moment of defect origin, to determine its development dynamics and thereby to conduct the early monitoring of accidents. The examples of created technologies application are given. The specificity of compiling of noise-matrix of early seismic monitoring of construction sites is shown. It is noted that as a result of introducing the developed technology into the monitoring system, after each low-power earthquake, the technical state of a building structure is analyzed and a message is issued on measures that need to be taken in this particular case.

268,268,Developing social responsibility in university students,"Social responsibility is a component of economic and social sustainability that influences the quality of life of communities. Therefore, people must be the starting point, as they participate in solving the problems of society. In this process, the universities have a fundamental role because in them there is a relationship between academia and reality and they are agents of social change. In this way, university social responsibility emerges as a policy of performance, of students, professors and managers by influencing the loyalty, satisfaction and perception they have of HIEs. Consequently, it is a reflection of the curricula and substantive functions of universities (research, projection and extension). From this perspective, the objective of the study is to measure the level of social responsibility and commitment of the main actor of the educational process that is the student. The incidental sample of the research was 120 students aged between 18 and 38 years. In the study, the instrument used for data collection, called construction of Social Responsibility of the University Student (RSEU), consisting of 21 items. The results show that the level of social responsibility and commitment of students in general is high (4.70). With respect to the scores of the dimensions of the study, it should be taken into account that they are in the following order; professional practice from social commitment (4.98), personal discovery of values (4.74), item criteria (4.61), social responsibility training (4.60), commitment to others and the environment (4, 52). It is concluded that the students in the sample have a high level of social responsibility, taking into account the elements of vocation and service, teamwork and influence in the immediate environment. Similarly, the results show that the commitment to others and the environment, the search for the common good, empathy and service to the other, represent the elements with the lowest values. It is recommended that social responsibility permeates the entire curriculum and that academic programs offer subjects and courses that involve social, scientific and cultural activities in which students participate. Consequently, projects and activities that lead to sensitivity should be encouraged in academic programs and classes to strengthen skills such as leadership, creativity, tolerance, responsibility and self-esteem.

Since there is a large volume of optical observations of trace gases by these techniques that are not accompanied by measurements of their characteristics, solving the problem of determining the properties of clouds and aerosol from the spectral measurements themselves could increase the accuracy of measuring trace gases. The paper considers the tasks of determining the characteristics of clouds (the bottom height, the optical depth, etc.) and aerosol (the optical depth, the vertical distribution parameters, etc.) from quantitates obtained from ZDOAS measurements (the O4 slant column, the color index, the absolute intensity, etc.). We performed numerical experiments for retrieving clouds and aerosol characteristics basing on radiative transfer simulations in cloudy atmosphere.

276,276,Design and evaluation of decentralized scaling mechanisms for stream processing,"Over the last decade, stream processing (SP) gained momentum as an efficient paradigm dealing with the real-time processing of large streams of data. As mature as they are, mainstream stream processing engines are not ready to be used over more distributed platforms that are today emerging such as Fog platforms. Streams being produced at the edge of the platform, and edges being composed of less powerful compute nodes, a decentralized approach of Stream Processing is needed. This paper moves a step towards decentralized SP by proposing a decentralized autoscaling mechanism for SP applications. Autoscaling refers to the ability for a system to automatically scale in and out as the load varies. As a stream processing application is generally composed of a set of operators in a pipeline, our protocol lets each operator's replica take scaling decisions and enforce them independently. Assuming a fully decentralized setting, we consider each replica has only a partial view of the graph of operators. Then, without care, concurrent distributed scaling could lead to inconsistencies in replicas' views and to data loss. To address this issue, we devise a maintenance protocol ensuring the consistency of replicas' views, no data loss and no downtime during reconfigurations. Finally, the paper describes the early experimentations conducted with a software prototype of a decentralized SP engine over a computing cluster, showing the usability of the mechanism.",60030553,Universite de Rennes 1,Rennes,France,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",22.6,0.05317460317460319,0.4257936507936508,1

Inspired by this, we collected a large-scale dataset with multi-scale and high-resolution UAV images, named MOHR, which contains 10,631 images captured by a UAV affixed with three kinds of cameras. Since these images were captured in a suburban environment, we manually annotated five classes of objects, including car, truck, building, collapse and flood damage.

278,278,Configuration of application layer protocols within real-time i4.0 components,"Within the context of Industry 4.0, future production systems are expected to support mass customization up to lot size one. In order to realize the individual production processes, a changeable and consistent integration of assets from different manufacturers is required. Therefore, the concept of I4.0 components was developed. Every I4.0 component provides a so-called asset administration shell, i.e. a standardized virtual representation of its capabilities. This paper focuses on real-time I4.0 components that require a deterministic communication with bounded low-latency in-between. In contrast to non-real-time I4.0 components, Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is enhanced by the new real-time communication technology Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN, IEEE 802.1).

279,279,Towards user-oriented programming of skill-based automation systems using a domain-specific meta-modeling approach,"Upcoming trends in manufacturing focus on flexible configuration of products up to lot-size one. This mass customization raises a need of flexible manufacturing and production systems that should react on fast changing market demands. As a result, it is getting more and more important to model all needed assets or skills in an user-oriented and configurable manner. Assets can represent any type of data or skill information needed in a manufacturing domain. Data information could be for example shown to a human worker (e.g. work instructions, images, videos or animations) or could be required by robots (e.g. coordinates, velocities).

Experimental results showed a wireless sensor node that uses a 100 mF energy storage capacitor can usually join the network in one attempt but multiple attempts may be needed if it uses smaller capacitances especially when the harvested power is low.

To avoid repetition of outage or failure, preventive maintenance scheduling also known as scheduled maintenance has been used widely in the power plant as an alternative based on the failure history of the equipment. However, the main issue plaguing scheduled maintenance is the redundancy of maintenance activities. Based on the selected adopted case study, we identified certain redundant activities in the scheduling.

285,285,Binocular camera trap for wildlife detection,"Camera traps are commonly used in wildlife monitoring. Traditionally camera traps only capture 2D images of wildlife moving in front of them. However, size information of wildlife is lost, which is vital to determine their ages and genders. To solve this problem, this paper develops a binocular camera trap based on stereo imaging for wildlife detection. The camera trap consists of two cameras, motion sensors, a photosensitive sensor and infrared illumination with the central wavelength of 940nm. Motion sensors output triggers to cameras when animals move past, and then pictures are captured from two different perspectives simultaneously. Meanwhile the photosensitive sensor perceives ambient illumination to control infrared illumination. In this way, the camera trap provides both 2D images of wildlife and their size information obtained by binocular vision. In addition, different from normal binocular cameras placed horizontally, these two cameras are set vertically for the convenience of installation and the expansion of dynamic measure range. As verification, we develop a prototype binocular camera trap to measure a human's height that is 178cm, and the estimation error approaches 2cm at the distance of 5m.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1706'],18.3,-0.027272727272727268,0.47878787878787876,1
286,286,On the issue of stability of hybrid automata by a part of variables,"The problem of the stability of hybrid automata according to certain variables is considered. This problem is urgent and develops rapidly, especially in recent years. Aspects of its solution using the Lyapunov functions are also considered. The problem of hybrid automata stability regarding certain variables arises naturally for solving the applied problems. Namely, when based on the requirements of the normal functioning of an object, it is sufficient to ensure its stability only according to some variables. Formulation of the problem of stability regarding certain variables belongs to A.M. Lyapunov, but he himself did not investigate this problem. There is a great methodological similarity in the study of stability considering all, and a part of variables using the Lyapunov functions. However, there are certain differences in resolving some identical issues as applied to stability problems for all and a part of the variables. There are methods to reduce the problem of stability regarding certain variables to the study of stability in all variables of some auxiliary system, and vice versa. These two types of stability are closely related and mutually complementary. Currently, the problem of the stability of hybrid automata in terms of variables is considered as an independent section of the theory of stability. It is shown that the property of the y1-positive definiteness of Lyapunov functions is not sufficient for studying the stability of hybrid automata in terms of a part of variables. The concept of a y1 -uniform positive definiteness of a function had been introduced. Theorems that provide sufficient stability conditions had been proved. For linear hybrid automata the constructive stability conditions had been obtained. The article also shows how using the stated theorems one can investigate the stability of hybrid timed automata.",60023137,Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv,Kiev,Ukraine,"['1712', '1710']",16.88235294117647,0.16776437847866418,0.5448283858998144,1

Two theorems are formulated and proved. For the number of s-chains of the form (which appeared in a random bit sequence of length n, n > 0 Theorems 1, 2 established explicit expressions of the joint distributions of such events: where is the number of s-chains of the form in the initial n-dimensional (0, 1)-sequence; , and are suitable nonnegative integers. One of the main assumptions of each theorem is that zeros and ones in a bit sequence are independent identically distributed random variables. The proofs of formulas for distributions of these events are based on counting the number of corresponding conductive events provided that (0, 1)-sequence contains a fixed number of zeros and ones. As examples of the use of explicit expressions of joint distributions we presented tables that contain the values of probabilities of the above events for the random (0, 1)-sequence of the length and some values of parameters , and under assumptions that zeroes and unities appear equally possible. For illustrative purpose some of the tables are presented by bubble chart.

Meanwhile, the cloud term 'as-a-service' has essentially revolutionized the information technology industry market over the last ten years. These two trends somehow are incorporating to inspire a new model for the assistive living application: HAR as a service in the cloud. However, with frequently updates deep learning frameworks in open source communities as well as various new hardware features release, which make a significant software management challenge for deep learning model developers. To address this problem, container techniques are widely employed to facilitate the deep learning software development cycle. In addition, models and the available datasets are being larger and more complicated, and so, an expanding amount of computing resources is desired so that these models are trained in a feasible amount of time. This requires an emerging distributed training approach, called data parallelism, to achieve low resource utilization and faster execution in training time. Therefore, in this paper, we apply the data parallelism to build an assistive living HAR application using LSTM model, deploying in containers within a Kubernetes cluster to enable the real-time recognition as well as prediction of changes in human activity patterns. We then systematically measure the influence of this technique on the performance of the HAR application. Firstly, we evaluate our system performance with regard to CPU and GPU when deployed in containers and host environment, then analyze the outcomes to verify the difference in terms of the model learning performance.

Fortunately, the Sentinel-2 satellite provides accessible multi-spectral imagery with a high spatial resolution to solve this problem. However, huge volumes of Sentinel-2 imagery produced every 5 days need a fast and accurate classifier for impervious mapping. In this paper, a novel spectral spatial residual convolution neural network (SSRCNN) has been designed to deal with the massive imagery for impervious classification with high speed and accuracy. Compared to typical algorithms, deep learning methods are more suitable in this task. The CNN demonstrates great success in image classification.

302,302,Enhancing authorization mechanisms using attribute certificates for OPC UA based applications,"In the context of Industrie 4.0, integrity of data is considered as the core of networking and digitalisation. End-to-end security of the communicating entities within and across organizational boundaries is enabled by authentication and authorization methods. In order to ensure authorized access or modification to data, an access control system is used. Such an access control system based on the role of an entity is a Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system. In case of distributed networks, the authorization permissions of the communicating entities is determined both within and across organizational boundaries. For example, each organization defines the authorization permissions for each of its resources for both internal and external access. In case of external access, an organization can determine permissions based on a role assigned to an external entity trying to communicate across its organizational boundaries. Here, trusted association between the role and the identities need to be determined. Thus, the role/roles assigned to the external entity can be determined using an Attribute Certificate (AC). An AC contains the attribute/attributes that determines the characteristics associated with an entity. An Attribute Authority (AA) of an organization that assigns a role attribute to the AC of an entity, issues each AC. Such an AA is created and managed using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The OPC UA (Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture) framework has different options for user authentication and one of the options is using X509IdentityToken. Integrating ACs in order to enhance authorization mechanism in the context of Industrie 4.0 is considered in this work.

305,305,A study on the emotional feature composed of the melfrequency cepstral coefficient and the speech speed,"Through experiment, this research introduces and verifies the usefulness of prosody attributes such as loudness, pitch and sound length as an emotional feature to express the characteristics of the emotion being felt. Sound length is proportional to pronunciation duration and is inversely proportional to the number of phonemic changes per unit of time. Based on these facts, speech speed and the emotional feature were calculated as follows. First, a codebook was generated using mel-frequency cepstral frequency (MFCC) vectors from a preexisting emotional speech database. Second, the MFCC vector of the speech signal was vector-quantized by this codebook to generate a quantized sequence. Third, this sequence was considered for a phoneme sequence and the speech speed was computed by normalizing the number of phoneme changes for each window of time. Fourth, the emotional feature was generated based on this speech speed as follows. The speech speed was added to the MFCC vector with delta and acceleration computation to generate an emotional feature that is related to prosody elements such loudness, pitch and sound length. In order to analyze the utility of these emotional features, a recognition system was developed with the emotional features and a hidden Markov model (HMM). For maximum performance, the degree of MFCC, size of the codebook, method of speech speed computation, window size of speech speed computation, number of HMM model state and the number of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) per state were carefully selected. To test the recognition system a text-independent, speaker-independent experiment and a text-independent, speaker-dependent experiment were conducted. It was verified that the recognition system using emotional features showed better performance than the recognition system using only speech features, with improvements of 2.5% and 3.5%, respectively, in different experiments.",60068689,Hanbat National University,Yusong,South Korea,['1706'],23.833333333333332,0.07430555555555556,0.4944444444444445,1

One of the major issues that engineers are facing is that, current programming methods are too time-consuming and they lack of intuitiveness use by human users. However, the latest advances in the field of sensors, let manufacturers to develop and produce devices that allow humans to interact with machines in a more intuitive way, reducing the need of additional complex software components, and hence, the required time to establish the aforementioned human-machine interactions. This research work presents an approach for gesture-based on-line programming of industrial robot manipulators. This is achieved by utilizing a combination of devices with a set of integrated, cost-effective visual and bending sensors, in order to precisely track the user's hand position and gestures at system run-time. This continuous tracking allows the robot manipulator to mimic the operator's hand motion. In addition, desired paths performed by a human with expertise on task execution, are translated into robot targets, composing a new robot path, and are stored for later use. Such path can be modified to fit into different robot manufacturers, programming language.

All rights reserved.The primary objective of this work is to provide virtual medical assistance and awareness, second opinions and trustworthy methods of disease prediction through our implementation of a model that would predict diseases from symptoms using Machine Learning Techniques and suggest the appropriate precautions, drugs and physicians for appointment. Most of the similar systems focus either on specific diseases (heart, cancer, diabetes) and feedback systems (exclusively prediction or physician appointment systems), and very few can do a combination of both effectively. In models where the accuracy of prediction is really high, there are either very few options for medical assistance, or the services are exorbitantly priced. We attempt to resolve all of this with our proposed model-the users are asked to select five of their most prominent symptoms. After this, three algorithms-KNN, Random Forest and Gaussian Naïve Bayes are used. Three diseases are predicted using each of the three techniques, along with the accuracy of prediction of the same. Precautions for the predicted diseases are suggested, along with the recommended drugs and side effects.

Here, we present the design and power scaling characterization of a cladding-pumped amplifier with ytterbium dopant located in an annular region near the ultra low NA core in the cladding, which is found to be a promising way to achieve multi-kilowatt single mode fiber lasers. The ultra low NA ensures that the fiber amplifiers operate in single mode state, which results to that the fiber amplifiers are free of the limitation of the transverse mode instability, and that the mode field of the signal laser extends into the cladding to extract gain amplification. The annular ytterbium-doped region located in the cladding can overcome the contradiction between high doping concentration and ultra-low NA design, which can simultaneously obtain high pump absorption with ultra low NA. The size of annular ytterbium-doped region under different core NA has been studied for various core sizes, which shows that the optimal size of annular ytterbium-doped region is related to the core NA and the core size. Detail analysis of high power amplification of cladding-ring-up-doped ultra low NA single mode fiber amplifier has been presented, which includes various nonlinear effects and thermal effects. It shows that, due to the specific design, the single mode characterization of the fiber is less influenced by the detrimental thermo-optic effect, which means that the cladding-annular-doped ultra-low NA fiber has high mode instability threshold than the ultra-low NA fiber with the core being fully uniformly doped.

331,331,Performance optimization for infiniband virtualization on QEμKVM,"The emergence of machine learning applications has brought the new demands for high performance computing in cloud environment. Besides accelerators, such as GPU or TPU, fast interconnection among and within computers becomes more and more important to achieve efficient training and learning. One of the high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnection architectures is InfiniBand. However, software based virtualization of InfiniBand in QEμKVM suffers large performance degradation owing to virtualization overhead and memory allocation problem. In this paper, two techniques, doorbell mapping and memlink, are proposed to optimize the performance the InfiniBand virtualization on QEμKVM. Doorbell mapping allows the applications in guest user-space to access the doorbell memory page directly so that the virtualization overhead is minimized. Memlink ensures memory contiguity after virtualization, which is a critical requirement for zero-copy between guest and host. Experiments show that the virtualized InfiniBand with mmap and memlink can achieve near native performance for large data transmissions. Comparing to the previous InfiniBand virtualization on QEμKVM, our implementation obtains over 3.5 times performance improvement in various benchmarks.",60022847,Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan,Hsinchu,Taiwan,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",18.666666666666668,0.11721789321789321,0.527890331890332,1

336,336,Interactive gigapixel video streaming via multiscale acceleration,"Immersive video applications grow faster for users to freely navigate within a virtualized 3D environment for entertainment, productivity, training, etc. Fundamentally, such system can be facilitated by an interactive Gigapixel Video Streaming (iGVS) platform from array camera capturing to end user interaction. This interactive system demands a large amount of network bandwidth to sustain the reliable service provisioning, hindering its massive market adoption. Thus, we propose to segment the gigapixel scene into non-overlapped spatial tiles. Each tile only covers a sub-region of the entire scene. One or more tiles will be used to represent an instantaneous viewport interested by a specific user. Tiles are then encoded at a variety of quality scales using various combinations of spatial, temporal and amplitude resolutions (STAR), which are typically encapsulated into temporally-aligned tile video chunks (or simply chunks). Chunks at different quality level can be processed in parallel for real-time purpose. With such setup, diverse chunk combinations can be simultaneously accessed by heterogeneous user per its request, and viewport-adaptation based content navigation in an immersive space can be also realized by adapting multiscale chunks properly, under the bandwidth constraints. A serial computational vision models measuring the perceptual quality of viewport video in terms of its quality scales, adaptation factors, as well as the peripheral vision thresholds, are devised to prepare and guide the chunk adaptation for the best perceptual quality index. Furthermore, in response to the time-varying network, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based adaptive real-time streaming (ARS) scheme is developed, by learning the future decision from the historical network states, to maximize the overall quality of experience (QoE) in a practical Internet-based streaming scenario. Our experiments have revealed that averaged QoE can be improved by about 60%, and its standard deviation can be also reduced by ˜ 30%, in comparison to the popular Google congestion control algorithm widely adopted in existing system for adaptive streaming, demonstrating the efficiency of our multiscale accelerated iGVS for immersive video application.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,['1706'],27.0,0.11190476190476191,0.4184285714285715,1

Yet, there is lack of knowledge how people perceive and accept power lines in certain landscape types and in combination with wind turbines, a required setting to achieve goals of the energy turnaround. The goal of this work was to demonstrate how 3D point cloud visualizations could be used for an eye tracking study to systematically investigate the perception of landscape scenarios with power lines. 3D visualizations of near-natural and urban landscapes were prepared based on data from airborne and terrestrial laser scanning. These scenes were altered with varying amounts of the respective infrastructure, and they provided the stimuli in a laboratory experiment with 49 participants. Eye tracking and questionnaires served for measuring the participants’ responses. The results show that the point cloud-based simulations offered suitable stimuli for the eye tracking study.

342,342,Hybrid robust image steganography approach for the secure transmission of biomedical images in cloud,",.INTRODUCTION: A rich patient may reside in their home and may prefer to take treatment with all the medical appliances inside the premise. A patient may take treatment in the less specialized hospital, which may be taking a suggestion from a specialist working in a specialized center. In such a scenario, bio-medical images need to be transmitted over the public network. Bio-medical images sent in plain form suffer from confidentiality and integrity problem. OBJECTIVES: To overcome the above problem, medical records are always hidden in the cover image so that others do not know what is being sent. METHODS: In our proposed scheme, the chosen cover image gets divided into the following three planes, namely: R plane, G plane, and B plane. The co-occurrence matrix is computed for each plane by dividing it into 16 x 16 pixels block and then the embedding map is generated from it. The biomedical image is also divided into 8 x 8 pixels block and is hidden into the chosen cover image block using the embedding map. Both cover image blocks and secret image blocks are transformed by RIWT. R matrix of QR decomposition of the cover image and secret image blocks are used in embedding At the end of the embedding phase. These three planes are merged into an RGB image to produce a stego image. RESULTS: To assess the performance of our scheme, parameters like imperceptibility, robustness, and security are considered. With respect to imperceptibility, PSNR values of the stego images are over 50. With respect to robustness, average NCC values between the original secret and the attacked secret is 0.94. With respect to security, stego image cannot be detected easily if it has any secret. CONCLUSION: From the experimental results, our scheme is proved to be better with respect to these three selected parameters.",60023483,Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research,Chennai,India,['1701'],18.9375,-0.05367965367965367,0.4132034632034633,1

In this context, it is of utmost importance the implementation of zero-defect strategies relying on sensing and control systems to improve automation and minimize failures. Non-invasive physical sensing is not always feasible. In those cases, virtual sensors may stand for a great tool to support the development of enhanced control systems. In this work, a new methodology for building virtual sensors is presented. The novelty of the methodology relies on the coupling of two modeling techniques: detailed computer-aided engineering (CAE) simulations and model order reduction (MOR) techniques. The result is a realtime simulation model that can provide the variables required by the control system, using other available data (physically sensed) as input. Hence, the coupling between virtual and physical sensors can provide a richer description of the process to improve the process control and performance. To demonstrate the methodology, a case study is presented, where the virtual sensor is aimed at defining the flow pattern (fluid interface position) within a flow-focusing microfluidic device. The resulting virtual sensor can predict in real-time the shape and location of a multiphase fluid interface inside the microchip, based on the volumetric flow rates measured at the chip inlets.

355,355,Infrared object image instance segmentation based on improved mask-RCNN,"In recent years, the traditional automotive industry has also begun to enter the field of autonomous driving technology, seeking new breakthroughs. From simple pedestrian and vehicle detection, to the instance segmentation of traffic scenes, to the ideal all-intelligent driving, it has begun to be occupied by deep learning. Research scholars have tried to build a vehicle's control strategy system entirely using computers and also proposed a full convolutional neural network that replaced the fully connected structure with convolutional ideas, realizing the transition from image classification to dense pixel prediction. This is the first step for neural network to be used for scene instance segmentation, and it is also a key step for intelligent driving. However, the effect of the full convolutional neural network is not very ideal. An important problem is that the pooling layer will lose part of the location information while aggregating the background. For dense prediction of image instance segmentation, the context information (location information) of each pixel is indispensable, which is very important for the final classification of pixels. Thus, later researchers proposed three different structures to solve this problem: cavity convolution structure, codec structure, space pyramid structure. This paper analyzes the working principles and characteristics of several different structures and compares the differences between various networks. This paper combines a Mask-RCNN to construct a new network structure for image instance segmentation. The main innovations of this paper are as follows: 1. Introduce generative adversarial network into the field of image segmentation. Combine the conditional generative adversarial network idea, using the original image as the input of the generator, and the generative to generate the desired instance segmentation result. Combine the original image with the instance segmentation result generated by the generative, or combine the original image with the manually labeled segmentation result as the input to the discriminator. By training the network so that the discriminator cannot distinguish between the image generated by the generator and the result of the manual annotation, the generator can generate a satisfactory image segmentation result. 2. Introduce superpixel information of the image. In this paper, the boundary information obtained by superpixel segmentation is input into the generator network as a segmentation condition. For the original input image, this paper uses superpixel segmentation method to obtain the subtle contour of the image, and then stacks the superpixel segmentation result with the original image as the input of the generated network. 3. Reconstructed a new image segmentation structure. In the image translation model, the processing at the boundary is often difficult to achieve good results, so this article changes the output layer of the generator to K (K represents the number of classifications) channels to output the results. This paper adopts the Encoder-Decoder structure in DeconvNet, removes the full connection layer to reduce the model parameters, and changes the pooled indexing method to the direct stacking structure.",60087294,Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics,Wuhan,China,['1706'],20.695652173913043,0.18864639989639995,0.6189354626854626,1

In order to more accurately identify the surface defects of a varistor body and the pins, a method for identifying the surface defects based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed. The proposed method mainly includes four stages: image acquisition and data set construction, convolutional neural network modeling, CNN training and testing. Firstly, varistor images are acquired, and the body and pins of the varistor are segmented by image segmentation method. The number of samples is increased by data augmentation to make a data set of 5 classes. Secondly, according to the appearance characteristics of varistor, a CNN model is designed for varistor surface defect recognition. Third, using the created data set, the training data set with category labels are input to the proposed CNN for training.

This loss of spectral information causes varying degrees of color distortion in underwater images. In this paper, a novel underwater color correction algorithm based on scattering statistics characteristics is proposed.

361,361,On the security threat of abandoned and zombie cellular IoT devices,"The number of network-connected devices increased exponentially at least during the last two decades. Although the robustness and long-term stability of these devices are relatively high, many of them outlast the purpose of their installation, sometimes even the life-cycle of its serving connection technology.The number of long-living, radio-transmitting, abandoned devices keeps increasing, especially with new deployments of Internet of Things (IoT) endpoints. Such equipment occupy radio resources in both licensed and public radio bands; moreover, they seize processing resources in networking equipment. This worrying situation should be taken care of. In the short term we can identify and ban such devices, but in the long term, proper, standardized life-cycle management should be put in place.This paper demonstrates the manifestation of this problem on 3GPP-based cellular networks (3G, 4G, and 5G), although similar issues are threatening for WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and LoRaWAN technologies, as well.

362,362,A Lite Asymmetric DenseNet for effective object detection based on convolutional neural networks (CNN),"Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely used in object detection and image recognition for their effectiveness. Many highly accurate classification models based on CNN have been developed for various machine learning applications, but they generally computationally costly and require a hardware-based platform with super computing power and memory resources to implement the algorithm. In order to accurately and efficiently achieve object detection tasks using CNN on a system with limited resources such as a mobile device, we propose an innovative type of DenseNet, which is a lightweight convolutional neural network algorithm called Lite Asymmetric DenseNet (LADenseNet). Aiming to compress the CNN model complexity, we replace the 7 x 7 convolution and 3 x 3 max-pool with multiple 3 x 3 convolutions and a 2 x 2 max-pool in the initial down-sampling process to significantly reduce the computing cost. In the design of the dense blocks, channel splitting and channel shuffling are employed to enhance the information exchange of feature maps and improve the expressive ability of the network. We decompose the 3 x 3 convolution in the dense block into a combination of 3 x 1 and 1 x 3 convolutions, which can speed up the computations and extract more spatial features by using asymmetric convolutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach we develop an experimental system in which LA-DenseNet is used to extract features and Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) is used to detect objects. With VOC2007+12 as training and testing datasets, our model achieves comparable detection accuracy as YOLOv2 with a fraction of its computational cost and memory usage.",60022281,Beijing University of Technology,Beijing,China,['1706'],33.125,0.20081453634085214,0.47449874686716786,1

Success of these systems depends on two very important factors: power efficiency of the sensor nodes and communication reliability. In this paper, we investigate the effect of using unidirectional (broadcasting) communication on the power consumption and reliability of a wireless sensor node. A high-precision wireless temperature sensor reported in an earlier publication is employed as a case study. First, we calculate the energy required to transmit and receive a message using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) in the physical layer without taking any reliability precautions. Then, we estimate the amount of energy required for the reliable transmission of a BLE packet using the BLE acknowledgment method and forward error correction (FEC) in the application layer.

As the collected data increases, there are more missing values and noisy data. Related studies have already proposed various methods to solve the problems in big data. Among them, most studies focused on either feature selection or instance selection for data preprocessing before training forecast models. Metaheuristic algorithm is one of the mainstream methods in data preprocessing. However, most of these studies rarely considered feature and instance selection simultaneously. In addition, they seldom focused on noisy data. Therefore, this work combines the UCI datasets with noisy data to simulate the real situation. Memetic algorithm (MA) has excellent performance in machine learning of data selection, and variable neighborhood search (VNS) was also proved to be widely applied to the systematic change of local search algorithms. This work proposes a hybrid MA and VNS to find a new subset that maximizes the accuracy of the classifier while preserving the minimum amount of data by feature and instance selection simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently reduce the amount of data and the ratio of noisy data.

373,373,Deep-Gap: A deep learning framework for forecasting crowdsourcing supply-demand gap based on imaging time series and residual learning,"Mobile crowdsourcing has become easier thanks to the widespread of smartphones capable of seamlessly collecting and pushing the desired data to cloud services. However, the success of mobile crowdsourcing relies on balancing the supply and demand by first accurately forecasting spatially and temporally the supply-demand gap, and then providing efficient incentives to encourage participant movements to maintain the desired balance. In this paper, we propose Deep-Gap, a deep learning approach based on residual learning to predict the gap between mobile crowdsourced service supply and demand at a given time and space. The prediction can drive the incentive model to achieve a geographically balanced service coverage in order to avoid the case where some areas are over-supplied while other areas are under-supplied. This allows anticipating the supply-demand gap and redirecting crowdsourced service providers towards target areas. Deep-Gap relies on historical supply-demand time series data as well as available external data such as weather conditions and day type (e.g., weekday, weekend, holiday). First, we roll and encode the time series of supplydemand as images using the Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF), Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) and the Recurrence Plot (REC). These images are then used to train deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract the low and high-level features and forecast the crowdsourced services gap. We conduct comprehensive comparative study by establishing two supply-demand gap forecasting scenarios: with and without external data. Compared to state-of-art approaches, Deep-Gap achieves the lowest forecasting errors in both scenarios.",60072749,Qatar University,Doha,Qatar,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",24.4,0.1234375,0.2859375,1
374,374,Routing autonomous emergency vehicles in smart cities using real time systems analogy: A conceptual model,"Emergency service vehicles like ambulance, fire, police etc. should respond to emergencies on time. Existing barriers like increased congestion, multiple signalized intersections, queued vehicles, traffic phase timing etc. can prevent emergency vehicles (EVs) achieving desired response times. Existing solutions to route EVs have not been successful because they do not use dynamic traffic parameters. Real time information on increased congestion, halts on road, pedestrian flow, queued vehicles, real and adaptive speed, can be used to properly actuate pre-emption and minimise the impact that EV movement can have on other traffic.Smart cities provide the necessary infrastructure to enable two critical factors in EV routing: real-time traffic data and connectivity. In addition, using autonomous vehicles (AVs) in place of normal emergency service vehicles can have further advantages in terms of safety and adaptability in smart city environments. AVs feature several sensors and connectivity that can help them make real-time decisions. We propose a novel idea of using autonomous emergency vehicles (AEVs) that can meet the critical response time and drive through a complex road network in smart cities efficiently and safely.

380,380,A statistical exploration of interval-deficient wind speed data for application to wind power assessments,"Gathering quality wind speed data can be time-consuming and expensive. The present study established whether interval-deficient wind speed data could be rendered useful for wind power assessments. The effect of interval deficiency on the quality of the wind speed data was investigated by studying the behaviour of the Weibull scale and shape factors as the interval size between wind speed measurements increased. Five wind speed data sets obtained from the Southern African Universities Radiometric Network (Sauran) were analysed, based on a proposed procedure to find the true Weibull parameters from an interval-deficient wind speed data set. It was found that the relative errors in the Weibull parameters were, on average, less than 1%, compared with the Weibull parameters computed from a wind speed data set that complies with the IEC 61400-12-1:2005(E) standard. This finding may contribute to time and cost reduction in wind power assessments.

381,381,Transfer learning for cross-model regression in performance modeling for the cloud,"Performance characteristics of a complex system in different configurations are expensive to obtain due to the cost of sampling the system performance. We introduce ModelMap, a novel transfer learning technique for the performance modeling of configurable systems. ModelMap captures many explicit and latent types of dynamic system evolution, including configuration changes, scaling and hardware upgrades, by deriving and modeling directly these kinds of incremental transformations between system and/or application instances, over time. Modeling these transformations allows us to build accurate models for new configuration instances with just a few samples, and to interpolate across legacy models to build new models with no new samples at all. We experimentally test our method on a variety of system performance modeling and optimization scenarios. Compared to using conventional direct and incremental modeling techniques, our method achieves higher accuracy by up to an order of magnitude when the sampling budget is extremely limited, in particular between 0% to 5% of an exhaustive sampling budget. We also show how our method can be used to quickly derive an accurate resource allocation split that optimizes a given overall performance goal for co-hosted applications in a virtualized environment.",60016849,University of Toronto,Toronto,Canada,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",27.285714285714285,0.05786951144094001,0.40501443001442994,1

In this study, we propose to use text classification techniques to automatically identify Q-matrix. Specifically, we developed a three-stage model. In the first stage, a compact set of key features which are helpful in identifying different cognitive attributes are selected from items. In the second stage, items are transformed into real-valued vectors based on the key features for machine learning. In the third stage, three machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, support vector machine and Naive Bayes, are used and compared for automated Q-matrix identification. Using a sample of 805 third grade math items, we found Naive Bayes was the best algorithm, yielding an accuracy of 85.2% and an F1 measure of 85.6%.

In order to overcome the shortcomings of numeric simulation requires, like time consuming, high cost, and lot of data required, an machine learning method was adopted and trained for predicting oilfield production using static and dynamic developing parameters. Since the traditional BP neural networks cannot accurately capture the time correlation between data, a long short-term memory model was used to establish production prediction model that can consider the trends and context correlations of production data. Mean Decrease Impurity method was first conducted to analyze the relative importance of predictor variables. Relative unimportant features then can be excluded according to their relative importance. The dimension reduction of predictor variables was combined with production data to train and optimize LSTM network. Thereby predictive model for production prediction was established after the training. The actual oilfield data was used to verify the proposed approach and conducting application effect analysis. The results show that the predicted production computed by LSTM network is highly consistent with the actual production, which can accurately reflect the dynamic variation of production.",60105111,China University of Petroleum (East China),Qingdao,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.22222222222222,0.08987500000000002,0.41220833333333323,1

387,387,On the preservation of the trust by regression verification of plc software for cyber-physical systems of systems,"Modern large scale technical systems often face iterative changes on their behaviours with the requirement of validated quality which is not easy to achieve completely with traditional testing. Regression verification is a powerful tool for the formal correctness analysis of software-driven systems. By proving that a new revision of the software behaves similarly as the original version of the software, some of the trust that the old software and system had earned during the validation processes or operation histories can be inherited to the new revision. This trust inheritance by the formal analysis relies on a number of implicit assumptions which are not self-evident but easy to miss, and may lead to a false sense of safety induced by a misunderstood regression verification processes. This paper aims at pointing out hidden, implicit assumptions of regression verification in the context of cyber-physical systems by making them explicit using practical examples. The explicit trust inheritance analysis would clarify for the engineers to understand the extent of the trust that regression verification provides and consequently facilitate them to utilize this formal technique for the system validation.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,"['1706', '1710']",30.5,0.08080086580086579,0.5225108225108224,1

Apparently, the oxidation of p-AlTP yielded p-MBA without leaving any signs of the intermediated species like p-mercaptobenzyl-aldehyde or-alcohol (p-MBAl) in the air. In contrast to p-AlTP, o-methyl TP and m-methyl TP were not oxidized, indicating preferential reactivity of the para position in TP molecules. Nonetheless, the site selectivity is not always valid in this type of photocatalytic reactions, as o-, m-, and p-MBAl molecules were oxidized to corresponding o-, m- A nd p-MBA. Similarly, all of o-, m-, and p-MBA molecules were decarboxylated to TP in the air. With respect to the reaction mechanism, we confirmed that the oxidation of p-MeTP is not induced by thermal heating of the samples up to 373 K. Subtle temperature increase (<10 K) during the gap mode-induced oxidation was also corroborated by the observed Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering intensity of p-MeTP. Oxygen molecules accelerated the oxidation of p-MeTP at room temperature, whereas nitrogen atmosphere generated an intermediate species attributable to p-mercaptobenzyl radical.",60028263,Saitama University,Saitama,Japan,['1706'],24.625,0.029166666666666674,0.5625,1

In the approach a model is used as substitute of the real system to generate dataset containing records of both normal and fault cases. On the generated data, machine learning algorithm or ensemble of algorithms are selected and trained to detect the faults. To demonstrate the approach, the rack model of real data center is created, and reliability of the model is shown. Using the model, the dataset with normal as well as abnormal records of data is generated. To detect faults of local fans, simple classifiers are built for all pairs: a local fan - a processor unit. Classifiers are trained on one part of generated data (training data), and then their accuracy is estimated on another part of generated data (test data).

391,391,Communication delay compensation for precise force matching in teleoperation,"Teleoperation technology is widely employed in the fields of industry and human support. Bilateral control, which is one of the possible methods to achieve teleoperation, enables mutual transmission of operational force of an operator and reaction force from remote environment. However, teleoperation often involves non negligible communication delays, due to the limits of the communication networks. As a countermeasure against communication delays, bilateral control using a force-control-based communication delay compensation has been proposed. This approach is effective in stabilizing system behavior and in maintaining the force states, so that operator's operational force and reaction force from environment can act in pairs and opposite direction, even during contact tasks. In this paper, we introduce a bilateral control that makes use of a force-control-based communication delay compensation, with a new control structure in which structural redundancy of conventional system is removed.

393,393,Potential for grid efficiency based on a combination of leakage reactances of transformers of a transmission interconnecting line: Application of an exhaustive search algorithm,"Transmission interconnecting lines (called interconnectors in this study) are built to facilitate the exchange of active and reactive power between two areas of a network. Step-up and step-down transformers are required at the ends of the interconnector when interconnectors are at a different voltage, usually higher, than the net-works to be connected. A study was carried out to examine the impact on active power losses of a combination of leakage reactances of the transformers at the ends of an interconnector. The study assessed whether combi-nations can lead to different levels of active power losses and can thus affect the efficiency of the system. It was found that the combinations of reactance have a tangible impact on the power that flows through the inter-connector and, consequently, on the sharing of apparent power between the interconnector and the rest of the network. The total active power losses varied appreciably with the various combinations of reactances, result-ing in the life-cycle cost of active power losses also varying with the combinations.

Because of its all-pervading effect on all aspects of the society, starting from the day-to-day living of mankind to agriculture, industry, aviation, weather monitoring, and weather forecast, etc., probably it stands out to be the most significant factor that needs attention. Moreover, change in rainfall pattern all over the world necessitates an investigation of this parameter in-depth. The tropics play an essential role in regulating the atmospheric heat engine. So, the cloud characteristics in this region demand careful attention and understanding. In this paper the authors have investigated rainfall and upper air meteorological elements, viz. the cloud liquid water (CLW), the precipitation water (PW) and the latent heat (LH) derived from the data product 2A12 of the Tropical Microwave Imager (TMI) onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite over four tropical locations in India, namely Bangalore (12.97N, 77.59E), Bhubaneswar (20.29N, 85.82E), Calcutta (22.57N, 88.36E), and Gadanki (13.45N, 9.16E). The study shows that the rainfall can be predicted with excellent accuracy based on the cloud liquid water (CLW), the precipitation water (PW), and the latent heat (LH). It is further found out from the investigation that though all these parameters can predict rainfall independently, all the elements put together can predict rainfall with greater accuracy.

406,406,An availability metric and optimization algorithms for simultaneous coverage of targets and areas by wireless visual sensor networks,"The maturation of Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) in the last years, with new communication technologies and continuous releasing of embedded hardware development platforms, has significantly enlarged the number and relevance of visual monitoring applications, better supporting smart city and Internet of Things initiatives. However, there are still several challenges to be addressed, especially when visual sensors are used for critical monitoring. When availability issues are addressed in WVSN, different metrics and algorithms can be employed, but such approaches are usually focused on a single coverage goal. Actually, some monitoring applications may want to simultaneously optimize coverage over targets and areas alike, which requires an appropriate perception of the level of availability of the application at any given time. In this context, this article proposes a new availability metric for WVSN, considering that all targets and areas should be optimally and simultaneously covered by the cameras. In addition, optimization algorithms are proposed and compared, aiming at improving the availability of applications when rotatable visual sensors are employed.",60013906,Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana,Feira de Santana,Brazil,"['1706', '1710']",27.833333333333332,0.08952922077922076,0.36039502164502163,1
407,407,A low latency non-blocking skip list with retrial-free synchronization,"The underlying technology trend stresses the design of the software. With increasing use of many-core computers that equip a large number of independent processor units, enhancing scalability and concurrency of commercial software is of crucial importance. To fulfill this demand, non-blocking implementations of the popular data structures are extensively explored both in academia and industry to effectively harness the massive parallelism in a many-core system. This paper presents a new non-blocking skip list that is not only scalable but also provides low latency even under high-concurrency pressure. Existing techniques for parallelizing skip lists rely on retrying insertion operations which fail because one thread interferes with another. This approach can introduce long-tail latency when multiple threads compete for access to the same links. We address this issue by exploiting the probabilistic nature of the skip list by allowing insertion operations to terminate after a failure, even if all the links from a node have not been updated. The resulting reduction in the heights of many nodes changes the statistical properties of the links, on which the efficiency of the skip list depends. We compensate this side-effect by recording reductions in node height and recompense for them when new nodes are created. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we implement a prototype of our low-latency non-blocking skip list, and the measurement study with various workloads shows that our skip list provides more scalable performance and lower tail latency compared to existing skip lists.",60014156,Soongsil University,Seoul,South Korea,['1706'],24.2,0.09843928001822738,0.4747892458418774,1
408,408,Assessing the effectiveness of teaching anatomy with virtual reality," Publication rights licensed to ACM.When performing medical procedures, physicians must rely on their mental representations to understand complex internal structures that are not directly visible on the skin. In their training, this knowledge is acquired through the study of two-dimensional images. Currently, virtual reality (VR) is revolutionizing the teaching-learning process because it offers an experiential, low cost and easy to manage alternative for teaching anatomy. Especially if compared with performing cadaveric practices. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of virtual reality for teaching anatomy. The design was quantitative and quasi-experimental. Three groups were defined for analysis: the self-directed practice of VR, an instructor lead practice of VR, and the control, no VR. The sample consisted of 120 medical students in their second year of the program. A descriptive research scope was defined. The results indicate that VR had a positive impact on learning of the spatial location of anatomical structures. The students found innovation motivating and engaging. It is necessary that medical educators establish and consolidate standards for the implementation and assessment of VR, in order to guarantee an educational experience that guarantees the achievement of learning objectives of trainees.",60001285,Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud TecSalud,Monterrey,Mexico,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",16.25,0.04529505582137161,0.32783094098883575,0

410,410,Evaluation of customers' sustainable fashion perception," All rights reserved.Globalization, technological development and the associated transformation processes have both positive and negative effects not only on fashion industry organizations and their customers, but also on the global environmental protection. Positive transformation changes are associated with the ability of fashion organizations to satisfy changing needs of both mass and individual consumers in a dynamic environment that creates the conditions for creating mutual value, for organizations to create uniqueness and leadership in the global market. However, the constant satisfaction of changing consumers' needs and the creation of new ones, the lack of corporate social responsibility of fashion organizations and irresponsible consumer behaviour are prerequisites for environmental problems. An important aspect of addressing the identified issues is customers' sustainable fashion perception, which creates the conditions not only for changing consumers understanding about sustainable fashion and after all their behaviour, but also for fashion sector organizations to take social responsibility for their activities. Therefore, this research aims to evaluate the customers' sustainable fashion perception in Lithuania and its features. To reach the goal of the study such research methods as scientific literature review, survey (structured questionnaire), and multiple criteria assessment method were applied.

412,412,A noise resistant method by setting thresholds for use with face recognition,"Face recognition is one of the important research contents of biometric recognition, and it is widely used in various fields of life. The recognized face image is acquired by devices such as video capture, and noise is generated by device factors or external influences during the acquisition process, thereby reducing the accuracy of recognition. If the noise intensity is basically fixed, the smaller the pixel value is, the larger the proportion of noise is. This pixel has low reliability for image description. Therefore, a method of noise resistant is proposed from the angle of image preprocessing to reduce the impact of this problem. This anti-noise method first sets a certain threshold. If the pixel value in the image is lower than it, the pixel values below the set value will be directly set to 0. Then, using the classification algorithm of cosine similarity, the similarity calculation is performed on the face image, so that the image is classified, finally recognized, and the results are output. The experimental results show that after the appropriate threshold is selected, the proposed method can reduce the interference of noise on the classification and improve the accuracy of face recognition.",60005027,Guizhou University,Guiyang,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.666666666666668,0.10428571428571429,0.4803174603174603,1

414,414,Comparison of different probabilistic graphical models as causal models in alarm flood reduction,"The increasing amount of alarms and information for an operator in a modern plant becomes a significant safety risk. Although the notifications are a valuable support, they also lead to the curse of overloading with information for the operator. Due to the huge amount of alarms it is almost impossible to separate the crucial information from the insignificant ones. Therefore, new procedures are required to reduce these alarm floods and support the operator to minimize the safety risk. One approach is based on learning a causal model that represents the relationships between the alarms. This allows alarm sequences that are causally implied to be reduced to the root cause alarm. Fundamental element of this approach is the causal model. Therefore in this work, different probabilistic graphical models are considered and evaluated on the basis of appropriate criteria. A real use case of a bottle filling module serves as a benchmark for how well they are suitable as a causal model for the application in alarm flood reduction.",60028453,"Fraunhofer Institute for Optronics, System Technologies and Image Exploitation IOSB",Karlsruhe,Germany,"['1706', '1710']",18.555555555555557,0.14269972451790636,0.6413223140495867,1

416,416,UML sequence diagram for reusability of data components," All rights reserved.Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) document supports various types of multimedia resources that exist on the Internet. This paper discussed the ultimate goal of reusing of component and service is to get varied advantages in the business. Specifically, first, it reduces work with improved productivity and shorter lead time. Second, the improved quality reduces the number of errors. Third, the improved productivity reduces maintenance costs. Fourth, it reduces later rework through analyzing overall requirements for reuse. In software engineering, component-based development is a way to develop a software by reusing components. In other words, the developed component is saved on the repository, and the saved component can be relocated and reused by a user. Accordingly, this paper proved that SMIL-based animation document can be provided in terms of viewpoint of reuse. In such viewpoint, SMIL document improves existing XML animation document. Also, SMIL can efficiently enhance its reusability in terms of an application that creates multimedia presentation using the Internet. Currently, relevant software such as parser, editor, player, etc. has been actively developed. Consequently, effective component for computer animation is required to manage SMIL documents. Thus, this paper suggests a system to program interactions over time by transforming temporal script of computer animation tool kit in RASP into SMIL document format. This type of system creates SMIL document by using the UML sequence diagram.

418,418,Investigations of dental cavities: Between X-ray radiography and OCT,"Nowadays in dentistry a correct diagnosis is given only after a clinical and radiological evaluation. Radiographs are also required for treatment assessments. The aim of this study is to present results obtained on evaluating dental cavities in a dental clinic in Western Romania, using both X-ray radiography and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The most common methods for daily-basis clinical imaging are utilized, i.e. panoramic radiography and three-dimensional (3D) cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Advantages of OCT as an imaging method in dentistry are discussed: It avoids exposing the patient to X-ray radiation, and image resolution of OCT is superior. This led us to test this technique for dental assessments and see how it can work in conjunction with radiography. The study also provides upsides and downsides of both medical imaging techniques. Panoramic radiographs and 3D CBCT to several extracted teeth are performed. Dedicated toolbars from Romexis software (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) are analyzed with regard to their capability to make precise measurements. Processing of images are made to obtain a high-quality; measurements are done and data are collected. The same teeth are scanned with an in-house developed SS-OCT system. Images from both investigations are presented, and clinical conclusions are drawn.

Therefore, for sensors application, the resulting chromatic aberration of the overall optical system should be enhanced by implementation the sets of lens described by a low value of Abbe. The numerical analysis were carried out in order to design an optical system of proposed solution, which will be described by wide measurement range, low attenuation and narrow characteristic spectral peak.

The target of human activity recognition (HAR) is usually to detect and analyze distinguished activities from the data acquired via different sensors (e.g. thermal cameras). This work proposes a HAR approach from videos recorded via a thermal camera. Skeletons of human bodies are extracted from thermal frames using an opensource deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach named OpenPose. It is generally applied on videos of typical color cameras. However, this work adopts OpenPose on thermal images to extract useful features so that the HAR system can be deployed in environments with low lights as well. Once skeletons of human silhouettes are obtained from the thermal images, robust spatiotemporal features are extracted followed by discriminant analysis. Finally, the discriminant features are fed into a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) for activity training and recognition.

In this paper, we propose a GAN-based inpainting model which can restore the semantic damaged images visually reasonable and coherent. In our model, the generative network has an autoencoder frame and the discriminator network is a CNN classifier. Different from the classic autoencoder, we design a novel bottleneck layer in the middle of the autoencoder which is comprised of four dense-net blocks and each block contains vanilla convolution layers and dilated convolution layers. The kernels of dilated convolution are spread out and result in an effective enlargement of the receptive field. Thus the model can capture more widely semantic information to ensure the consistency of inpainted images. Furthermore, the multiplex of different level's features in each dense-net block can help the model understand the whole image better to produce a convincing image.

With increasing information complexity, the decision speed decreases and the decision accuracy descends. Consequently, a fine balance between necessary, abundant, and superfluous information must be found. The second experiment studies human decision making in complex environments using a business simulation. We found that correct decision aids can augment the human-in-the-loop's decision making and that these can increase usability, trust, and proft.

The robot has two maps; one is a detailed map created by sensor observation during movement, and the other is a simple map provided as pre-information. The robot performs the matching between detailed and simple maps and converts waypoints on the simple map to waypoints on the detailed map.

The strategy is referred to as ""matched sites targeting"", in which CERES instruments scan at nadir along their respective collocated ground-tracks. This strategy is enabled by similarities in the Suomi-NPP (FM5)/JPSS1 (FM6) and Aqua (FM3) satellite orbits, and a special scan profile available for the CERES scanners. Comparison of collected data in this strategy is done at a footprint level between the instruments (FM5 and FM3 or FM6 and FM3) for specific scene types, determined by their ""almost"" coincidental ground-tracks. A far more stringent test of the measurement consistency is achieved as averages of 330 collocated nadir samples are compared.

However, despite the importance of protecting engineering data, so far no concept has been presented to ensure and control on a fine-grained level the confidentiality, authenticity and accessibility of information stored in AutomationML files. In this paper, we introduce a basic access control scheme for AutomationML that enables to define user read and write access for each component. Furthermore, the scheme supports non-repudiation based on a change history and so-called 'signature chains'. It is also capable of supporting views and restricted access to components. The scheme is based on cryptographic measures - i.e. cryptographic hashing, symmetric encryption, signatures, and asymmetric encryption - and enforces its access control mechanisms through encryption to protect against unauthorized reading, and through signature chains to protect against unauthorized manipulation and to ensure non-repudiation. This approach has the benefit to be independent of the underlying file and operating system, storage location, etc., and it keeps full CAEX-conformity by extending AutomationML.This concept can serve as basis for software tools that support AutomationML and want to integrate access control features directly into AutomationML.",60018163,Technische Universitat Wien,Vienna,Austria,"['1706', '1710']",23.666666666666668,0.14285714285714285,0.40714285714285714,1

Ultrahigh-vacuum chemical vapor deposition is used to grow Ge mesa stripes on (001) Si wafers partially covered with SiO2 masks, followed by a growth of Si capping layer. Micro-Raman spectra reveals that SiGe is formed selectively on the {113} sidewalls of Ge mesa structure running in the [110] direction, resulting from an intermixing between the Si capping and Ge layers, whereas no such SiGe is detected on the flat-top (001) mesa surface. An increased amount of SiGe is observed for stripe patterns misaligned from the [110] direction. This suggests that the atomic step/roughness on the sidewall contributes to the intermixing. The observed SiGe formation would be applied to the bandgap engineering to tune the operation wavelengths in Ge photonic devices on Si. In fact, a significant blue shift in the direct-gap light emission peak is observed for submicron-wide Ge mesa structures with no flat-top (001) surface, where the surface is totally surrounded by SiGe.",60025272,University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,['1706'],26.571428571428573,0.159375,0.553125,0
438,438,Effects of color systems' transformation on optical flow estimation of noisy and degraded images,"Varying illumination and image blur are some of major challenges faced by contemporary methods of optical flow estimation. Despite significant advancement, these aspects have not received much of attention by modern-day methods. Latest work in this field is heavily affected and produce adverse results when dealing with images containing variable illumination and blur. In this paper, we investigate the effects of color space transformations on optical flow estimation from degraded and noisy images. In our experiments, clean and noisy images have been used. These images contain different kinds of blur and atmospheric effects such as fog, mist, shadows and dark regions. By estimating optical flow with three types of sequences in parallel (super clean, clean and noisy), and using four popular color systems, the effects of color space transformation have been observed on the estimated flow fields. The four color systems include RGB (red, blue, green), HSV (hue, saturation, value), HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) and XYZ (as standardized by the International Commission on Illumination in 1931). It is found that output of an optical flow algorithm not only depends on the color system adopted, but some color spaces tend to favor some special type of image sequences. For instance, XYZ color system is more favorable for the images abiding by the brightness constancy assumption while HSV color space is more suitable for blurry and noisy images. While keeping rest of the parameters unchanged but only transforming the color-space, we estimated the optical flow. Obviously the results of an algorithm applied to clean images for optical flow, would not be consistent with a flow estimated from same images containing noise. The objective is to compare this adversative effect for different color spaces. The flow estimation errors in four color systems have been reported and compared, and the best color-space is pointed out in each case. The paper also discusses the possible factors behind these variable outcomes with an insight into the basic frameworks of traditional methods for optical flow.",60003353,Harbin Engineering University,Harbin,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.866666666666667,0.15292919799498747,0.4863095238095238,1

Compared with position control, force control exhibits better performance of dynamics and compliance for the robot's interactions with complex environments. However, force control without direct feedbacks from torque sensors may come with poor tracking performance of joint compliance when the robot equipped with gears of high reduction. To solve this problem, we propose a new method to estimate joint torque from motor current and rotation velocity detected on each joint, using a more precise friction model of the harmonic gear.

The ML-framework is designed to circumvent the challenges of high-dimensional discontinuous machine data applied in machine learning-based predictive maintenance analysis. To circumvent high-dimensionality and discontinuity in machine data, the ML-framework minimizes discontinuity by defining point clusters based on the dataset's modality defined by a kernel density estimation (KDE). The bandwidth of the KDE is parameterized through a solution of the approximate mean integrated squared error (AMISE) obtained using the heat equation. Then, low-dimensional representations of each cluster are learned using Laplacian eigenmaps. Finally, the original time sequence of each observation across the low-dimensional clusters is used to re-index the disjointed low-dimension representations into a continuous low-dimension feature set.

In order to solve this problem, we proposed a method which can get more accurate light field depth estimation results with faster speed. First, the light field data is augmented by proposed method considering the light field geometry. Because of the large amount of the light field data, the number of images needs to be reduced appropriately to improve the operation speed, while maintaining the confidence of the estimation. Next, light field images are inputted into our network after data augmentation. The features of the images are extracted during the process, which could be used to calculate the disparity value. Finally, our network can generate an accurate depth map from the input light field image after training. Using this accurate depth map, the 3D structure in real world could be accurately reconstructed.

Further, it is observed that for constant values of magnetic intensity and Reynolds number. As the angle of inclination increases, the velocity decreases. Further, in all above situations the velocity profiles are perfectly parabolic and the no slip conditions are satisfied at both the boundaries. it is seen that as the ‘Re’ increases, the skin friction in the boundary layer region increases. Further, as the angle of inclination of the boundary surface increases, the skin friction decreases and finally converges to zero. For a slight change in the applied magnetic intensity, a marginal change in the skin friction is noticed in the boundary layer region. Also, it is observed that as the angle of inclination increases, the skin friction is observed to be increasing. The nature of profiles in both the cases do not differ qualitatively.

Mass media campaigns against alcohol acts as sources of information to halt alcohol abuse and its potential harmful effects.

Simple relational nodes are basic elements of the proposed sorting structures. Such elements can be implemented on a different element basis, for example, on devices of selecting a maximum or minimum of two analog or digital signals, which can be implemented on CMOS current mirrors and carry out the continuous logic limited difference function. The homogeneous sorting structure on such elements implementation, consisting of two layers and a multichannel sampling and holding device was offered. Nine signals corresponding to a selection window of a matrix sensor are fed to this structure, and are sorted by five iterative steps, and at the output we receive the signals sorted by the rank, which, using the code controlled programmable multiplexer, generates an output signal, that corresponds to the selected rank. Technical parameters of such relational preprocessor were evaluated. The paper considers results of design and modeling of CL BC based on current mirrors (CM) for creating picture type image processors (IP) with matrix parallel inputsoutputs. Such sorting nodes have a number of advantages: high speed and reliability, simplicity, small power consumption, high integration level. The inclusion of an iterative node for sorting signals into a modified nonlinear IP structure makes possible to significantly simplify its design and increase the functional capabilities of such processor. The simulation results confirm the proposed approaches to the design of sorting nodes of analog signals of the iterative type. The power consumption of the processors does not exceed 2mW, the response and processing times are 10µs and can be less by an order of magnitude, the supply voltage is 1.8÷3.3V, and the operating currents are optimally in the range of 10÷20µA. The energy efficiency of the proposed preprocessor with the iterative sorting node is 25x109 operations per second per ï€ watt, which corresponds to the best technical solutions. In the work we show, that after sorting or comparative analysis of signals by levels, a promising opportunity appears to implement image processors with enhanced functionality using the new method of weighting-selecting rank differences of signals. The essence of the method is that by composing the differences of the signals ordered by rank and the upper level of their range, we can simultaneously form several resulting output signals, choosing the necessary difference signals from their set according to the control commands and weighing them additionally before the summation. We show that using this approach and the method of processing we can significantly expands the set of operations and functions for image filtering, simplifying hardware implementation of IP, especially for analog and mixed technologies. We determined set of basic executable instruction-functions of the processors, presenting the simulation results in Mathcad, PSpice OrCad and other environments. We discussed the comparative evaluation of various modifications and options for implementing processor. We analyzed the new approach for the programmable selecting function or set of functions, including the selecting the required differences between the ranks of signals and their weights. We show the results of design and modeling the proposed new FPGA-implementations of MIP. Simulation results show that processing time in such circuits does not exceed 25 nanoseconds. Circuits are simple, have low supply voltage (2.5 V), low power consumption (50mW), digital accuracy. Calculations show that in the case of using an Altera FPGA chip EP3C16F484 Cyclone III family, it is possible to implement MIP with register memory for image size of 64*64 and window 3*3 in the one chip.

Real-time participant-generated data can enable large scale observational studies of health conditions, provide better insights into medical conditions of individuals and streamline clinical trial processes in medical research. However, privacy is a major concern for health data and there can be a lack of trust among different parties in the health data collection process. In addition, individuals often do not have sufficient control over the sharing of their data from the wearable devices.

454,454,Monte carlo based server consolidation for energy efficient cloud data centers,"The growing energy consumption of data centers is a compelling global problem and effective server consolidation is at the heart of energy efficient cloud data centers. A variant of bin packing can be used to model the server consolidation problem, where the constraints are multidimensional and heterogeneous vectors rather than scalars and the goal is to satisfy the requested resource allocation using the minimum number physical servers. Since bin packing is NP-hard, we rely on heuristics for practical solutions. Variations of First Fit Decreasing (FFD) based heuristics have been shown to be effective both in theory and practice for the one dimensional homogeneous case. However, the multidimensional and heterogeneous aspects of the server consolidation problem make it more complicated, requiring additional research to adapt FFD to the server consolidation problem. In this paper, we present a new FFD-based server consolidation technique using a Monte Carlo method and Shannon entropy, which considers resource bottlenecks and dynamically adjusts to variance in the utilization of different resources. The proposed heuristic outperforms existing techniques in all scenarios, achieving within 2-5% of optimal on average for medium to high variance in resource utilization, and within 10% worse than optimal on average for all scenarios.",60020633,University of Louisville,Louisville,United States,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",28.428571428571427,0.10914772727272729,0.47317099567099563,1

It consists of two separate steps: (1) estimating the 2D poses in multi-view images and (2) recovering the 3D poses from the multi-view 2D poses. First, we introduce a cross-view fusion scheme into CNN to jointly estimate 2D poses for multiple views. Consequently, the 2D pose estimation for each view already benefits from other views. Second, we present a recursive Pictorial Structure Model to recover the 3D pose from the multi-view 2D poses. It gradually improves the accuracy of 3D pose with affordable computational cost.

456,456,A novel ensemble method for electric vehicle power consumption forecasting: Application to the Spanish system,". All rights reserved.The use of electric vehicle across the world has become one of the most challenging issues for environmental policies. The galloping climate change and the expected running out of fossil fuels turns the use of such non-polluting cars into a priority for most developed countries. However, such a use has led to major concerns to power companies, since they must adapt their generation to a new scenario, in which electric vehicles will dramatically modify the curve of generation. In this paper, a novel approach based on ensemble learning is proposed. In particular, ARIMA, GARCH and PSF algorithms’ performances are used to forecast the electric vehicle power consumption in Spain. It is worth noting that the studied time series of consumption is non-stationary and adds difficulties to the forecasting process. Thus, an ensemble is proposed by dynamically weighting all algorithms over time. The proposal presented has been implemented for a real case, in particular, at the Spanish Control Centre for the Electric Vehicle. The performance of the approach is assessed by means of WAPE, showing robust and promising results for this research field.",60033284,University of Seville,Sevilla,Spain,['1700'],18.5,0.18214646464646467,0.4147474747474746,1

In this emerging field of research, there has been a strong drive towards modelling human-like characteristics and behaviors in chatbots. However, only a limited number of research endeavors have focused on a chatbot for automatic characterization of end-user emotions. In order to address this limitation, we propose an artificial intelligence based cognitive model for emotion awareness in chatbots using Markov chains, word embedding, and Natural Language Processing. The proposed model is able to extract emotions from conversations, detect emotion transitions over time, predict real-time emotions and intelligently profile human participants based on their distinct emotional characteristics. We conducted experiments using a real-world end-user dataset to demonstrate the functionality of the proposed model.

458,458,Verification of safety functions implemented in rust - A symbolic execution based approach,"Symbolic execution allows us to observe and assert properties of program code executing under (partially) unknown inputs and state. In this work we present a case study demonstrating that safety functions implemented in the Rust programming language can be verified by an assertion based approach. To this end, we leverage on previous developments adopting LLVM-KLEE for symbolic execution of Rust programs.In particular we show that reliability can be ensured by proven absence of undefined behavior and that safety properties (expressed as assertions) can be ensured for all reachable paths of the underlying implementation (under symbolic inputs). Moreover, the verification (besides stating assertions) is fully automatic and can be applied without any changes made to the implementation. While assertions have the advantage of being familiar to the mainstream programmer, they lack the expressiveness of dedicated logic developed for model checking. The paper also discusses complexity issues arising from path/state explosion inherent to symbolic execution. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on a representative use case implementing a safety function (equality) from the PLCopen library.

The approach is fully distributed in the sense that each production module to be optimized is equipped with its own optimization agent which local objective is the optimization of its own production objectives. To assure the necessary coordination between the agents, the resulting distributed optimization problem is designed using concepts of game theory. To this end, we model the production environment in terms of a potential game where each module is modeled as a player of the game. By assigning suitable utility functions to the players coordination of the agents behavior is achieved to find an optimal collective behavior.

461,461,Marker based pedestrian detection using augmented reality,"Pedestrian detection is a popular research topic from the last decade. Most of the pedestrian identification models are based on face recognition algorithms. It is a difficult task to detect and track individual pedestrians based on these algorithms because there is a compulsion that their faces should be towards the camera. This limitation makes face recognition algorithms inefficient to detect pedestrians from the backsides. In this paper, we proposed a method for pedestrian detection using marker recognition. Multiple pedestrians are detected and then tracked based on markers attached to their backsides. Attaching markers on backside of pedestrians helps to recognize them even when they are looking the other way. After the marker is recognized, the unique character related to that marker is displayed as a 3D object. This marker-based pedestrian detection is carried out using a mobile phone system and can be applied to embedded systems. The proposed method makes it possible to recognize up to three pedestrians located at different positions from the camera.",60017293,Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,Naples,Italy,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",16.5,0.07727272727272728,0.5674242424242425,1

These data are used in various types of services on IoT platforms. IoT services such as autonomous vehicles and factory automation system have the following three requirements. First, confidential data such as machine ID, power usage, and location information need to be locally anonymized before they are sent to a cloud server. Second, these applications require low latency response of less than 10 ms. Third, the bandwidth usage that an enormous number of IoT devices generate needs to be efficiently reduced to alleviate the burden on the cloud server. However, existing IoT platforms have limitations on the configuration of applications because most of them are cloud-based. In this study, we propose a fog-based IoT platform, where fog nodes achieve network transparency for the IoT devices and the cloud server. The network-transparent machine can be installed without modification of the existing network configuration and routing.

The smart parking system is one of the main services based on IoT applications. To identify parked vehicles, previous parking systems used special identification devices where Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags were carried by the users and high-quality cameras could recognize the vehicle license numbers. However, the previous methods were inefficient in terms of cost and they were not user-friendly. Thus, to address these problems, we propose a smart parking system based on ultrasonic sensors and the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in Bluetooth communication. The proposed system determines the available spaces by using sensor motes located in the parking spaces. In addition, it recognizes the location of a parked vehicle based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) communication between the user’s smartphone and the sensor motes. Furthermore, to improve the location awareness for users, we transform the RSSI strength into a distance range by applying the triangulation method. Based on IoT technology, the smart parking system can guide users to locations for their vehicles. We implemented the sensor motes for the ultrasonic sensor as well as the BLE modules in order to evaluate the proposed smart parking system. The sensor motes were deployed in parking spaces and we confirmed that the ultrasonic sensors successfully detected the available parking spaces, and they guided cars to the parking spaces divided into cell units.",60013400,Catholic University of Daegu,Gyeongsan,South Korea,"['1710', '1706']",21.636363636363637,0.2141269841269841,0.5268253968253969,0

Three kinds of cloud fraction data that comes from PATMOS-x/NOAA, CLARA-A2/NOAA and MODIS/Aqua were evaluated over Tibetan Plateau. Compared with ground observation, PATMOS-x had the highest correlation and the mean correlation was higher than 0.8. Three kinds of long term cloud fraction data showed similar spatial and temporal distribution pattern, namely that eastern Plateau has more cloud than western, northern Plateau has more cloud than southern and day time has more cloud than night. All three kinds of cloud data made mistake with snow along the ridge of mountain. In the daytime, CLARA-A2 had the highest monthly average cloud fraction. At night, the monthly average cloud fraction of Aqua/MODIS was more than that of PATMOS-x and CLARA-A2 except in summer. All three kinds of cloud fraction had similar annual mean value. CLARA-A2 had minimum cloud fraction in summer and maximum cloud fraction in winter. The linear regression and accumulate bias analysis showed that the annual mean cloud fraction of both PATMOS-x and CLARA-A2 displayed a decrease trend from 1982 to 2015.

467,467,LOGAN: Unpaired shape transform in latent overcomplete space,"We introduce LOGAN, a deep neural network aimed at learning generalpurpose shape transforms from unpaired domains. The network is trained on two sets of shapes, e.g., tables and chairs, while there is neither a pairing between shapes from the domains as supervision nor any point-wise correspondence between any shapes. Once trained, LOGAN takes a shape from one domain and transforms it into the other. Our network consists of an autoencoder to encode shapes from the two input domains into a common latent space, where the latent codes concatenate multi-scale shape features, resulting in an overcomplete representation. The translator is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), operating in the latent space, where an adversarial loss enforces cross-domain translation while a feature preservation loss ensures that the right shape features are preserved for a natural shape transform. We conduct ablation studies to validate each of our key network designs and demonstrate superior capabilities in unpaired shape transforms on a variety of examples over baselines and state-of-the-art approaches. We show that LOGAN is able to learn what shape features to preserve during shape translation, either local or non-local, whether content or style, depending solely on the input domains for training.",60018491,Simon Fraser University,Burnaby,Canada,['1704'],28.285714285714285,0.12896825396825395,0.5261904761904762,1
468,468,High-SNR single-pixel phase imaging in the UV+VIS+NIR range,"Phase imaging observes the phase of light interacted with the target. The conventional phase imaging methods such as interferometry employ two-dimensional sensors for image capture, resulting in limited spectrum range and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Single-pixel imaging (SPI) provides an alternative solution for high-SNR acquisition of target information over a wide range of spectrum. However, the conventional SPI can only reconstruct light intensity without phase. Existing phase imaging methods using a single-pixel detector require phase modulation, leading to low light efficiency, slow modulation speed and poor noise robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel single-pixel phase imaging method without phase modulation. First, the binary intensity modulation is applied which provides simplified optical setup and high light efficiency. Second, inspired by the phase-retrieval theory, we derive a joint optimization algorithm to reconstruct both amplitude and phase information of the target, from the intensity measurements collected by a single-pixel detector.

All rights reserved.Indian Ethos encompasses India‘s Value System, outlooks, beliefs, behavioral traits, views, customs, knowledge, and practices of its members traced to the earliest time of its recorded thoughts. The BhumiSukta of the Atharvaveda has identified the sustaining principles of the universe as-Truth, cosmic order, energy, consecration, austerity, knowledge and sacrifice which uphold the earth. In every nation there are certain thoughts, practices and tendencies which have survived the blows of time and are the perennial ethos of the nation. Indians stress on the Universal, and thus the particular is negated. The static Quality of thought is emphasized. There is a dearth of common sense concepts of time, and an urgency to know the Universal law and the Consciousness of Living Beings.

The state-of-art multi-projection based multi-view and light field 3D displays always employ projector array with multi-layer structure to achieve high angular resolution, but the projector's physical size still limits the angular resolution of 3D displays. To enhance the angular resolution of multiview and light field displays, a special designed angular steering optical device is integrated into the screen part of the display system, which is capable to deflect rays in a limited angular range to increase the density of projectors equivalently. A high-speed angular steering device is developed to deflect rays in a small angle based on the birefrigent effect of liquid crystal (LC), which mainly includes cascade structure of the pi cell LC and the birefringent LC microprism array. Furthermore, the steering angle control of this device can be well synchronized with the frame rate of projector array. With time-multiplexing of the steering angle, high angular resolution of multi-view and light field 3D displays with single-layer projector array are implemented. In our experiments, the developed angular steering device with steering angles of 0° and ±1° was successfully integrated into twelve-projector based multi-view and light field display systems to enhance the angular resolution respectively.

It aimes to recover missing pixels at different spectrum bands. The existing methods are limited to specific FAs and local regularization. To enhance generalization on different FA structures and improve reconstruction quality, here we present a non-local low-rank regularized demosaicing method, based on the non-local grouped sparsity of natural images. Specifically, the optimization model consists of two parts, including the regularization term of image formation model, and the low-rank term of non-local grouped image patches. The two terms ensure to remove noise and distortion while preserving image details.

479,479,Data reconstruction for cyber-physical landslide detection system,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) systems are often used to collect data from the environment for predicting landslide occurrence. However, due to the instability of wireless communications in WSN systems, data loss could occur often. To reconstruct the missing soil moisture data, heterogeneous data with spatio-temporal relations are used, such as soil moisture and rainfall intensity. In the spatial reconstruction method, we take into consideration not only the distance but also the difference of rainfall intensity between two locations. In the temporal reconstruction method, soil moisture will decrease because of evaporation if there is no rainfall. We use historical evaporation rate to reconstruct missing soil moisture data when there is no rainfall. If there is rain, we take a period of sensed soil moisture data to reconstruct any missing data. As a result, we can improve the accuracy of data reconstruction by selecting either spatial or temporal reconstruction results that have a smaller estimation error. The Root Mean Squared Error of spatiotemporal reconstruction is below 2%, even when there is 80% random missing soil moisture data. This is due to both spatiotemporal considerations, as well as, the use of heterogeneous data (rainfall intensity).",60007954,National Chung Cheng University,Min-Hsiung,Taiwan,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",19.2,-0.15520833333333334,0.3447916666666666,1
480,480,A multi-agent approach for hybrid intrusion detection in industrial networks: Design and implementation,"The integration of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (Network IDS) in industrial networks has improved the security of these systems due to their ability to analyze network traffic in order to detect potential system intrusions. Unfortunately, their detection scope is often limited to strategical network locations and may therefore not be capable to detect intrusions occurring at other system locations (e.g., specific devices). Hence, it is necessary to increase their detection scope by further analyzing additional information pertaining to other system components. The introduction of these new information sources adds more complexity to the intrusion detection problem, as it is not only necessary to identify them, but it is also required to define how their authentication, capture and analysis is to be carried out. Multi-Agent Systems are an architectural paradigm that can deal with such complexity. This paper presents a multi-agent approach for hybrid intrusion detection that takes into consideration the aforementioned challenges. This approach is comprised of a multi-agent hybrid intrusion detection architecture designed according to a set of properties. These properties consider IDS-specific requirements. It also takes into consideration current trends in the field of Multi-Agent Systems to provide security, scalability and adaptability across multiple systems.

In full-waveform LIDAR, system resolution is restricted by source pulse width and a data acquisition device bandwidth. To improve system-ranging resolution, we discuss a temporal super-resolution system with a deep learning network in this paper. In full waveform LiDAR system, When the emitted laser beam contact with different target, each time the emitted laser beam separates into a reflected echo signal and a transmission beam, the transmission beam travels in the same direction as the emitted laser. Until the transmission beam reach the ground, part of it will be absorbed by the ground and the other will become the final echo signal. Each beam transport in a different distance, and the backscattered beam will be collected and digitized by using low bandwidth detectors and A/D convertors. To reconstruct a super-resolution backscatter signal, we designed a deep-learning framework for obtaining LIDAR data with higher resolution. Inspired by the excellent performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and residual networks (ResNet) in image classification and image super-resolution. Considering that both image and LIDAR data could be regarded as a binary sequences that a machine could read and process in a manner, we come up with a deep-learning architecture which is specially designed for superresolution full wave-form LIDAR.

The tool developed can be used for performance comparison between different schools and future score prediction. We collected and compared the results of almost 650 students from various regions of Nigeria to establish a relationship between their academic performance in internal and external exams. Internal exams are those conducted by their respective schools while external exams are those held by independent bodies, like WAEC and JAMB.

Object classification is the most important function when searching for objects. We consider that the major concern is that the robot should not misclassify the object. If the robot misclassifies household object images, it will then perform the household tasks with the wrong object. This may cause serious damages to a service robot and to the user. This concept gives us the insight that the precision of the classification must be very high by setting a confidence threshold so that it then can claim a reliable service robot. By exploring this concept, we develop a more convincing indicator, Classification Reliability, to reveal the reliability of deep learning model. Moreover, we develop a fine-tune rule base to continuously regenerate more proper training dataset for the CNN model to increase reliability.

Therefore, in this paper, we present a probability density computing neural network (NN) training procedure. To overcome the limitation of an effective cost function, example uncertainty bounds are constructed with the help of correlation. Similar occurrences are selected through the correlation and weights are assigned to each similar occurrence based on both shape-similarities and ratio based similarities. Then example results from similar samples are considered. The normalized weighted distribution of examples is the probability distribution. Finally, a shallow NN with the example probability density is trained. The NN receives input circumstances and the cumulative probability. The NN returns the value corresponds to the given circumstances and the cumulative probability.

The numerical assessments of the safety integrity level of technological processes and controlled equipment (CE) for undiagnosed random failures is carried out in accordance with the standard at the design stage using probabilistic methods. The purpose of the work is to develop the numerical evaluation method at the operational stage of the safety level of technological process and controlled equipment by diagnosed failures at each time instant or for a given time interval. It is assumed that the level of functional safety of technological process and the controlled equipment is the highest when the controlled parameter is equal to its nominal value and is zero when the controlled parameter goes beyond the permissible deviations limits, i.e. in case of failure. This work proposed to evaluate (diagnose) the functional safety of the process and the controlled equipment by one parameter as the inversion of the module of the weighted deviation of the controlled quantity from its nominal value. A band window with weight power parabolic functions is used. The functional safety of the inertial process for one parameter is calculated as the average current sum of safety factors of each sample of the parameter being diagnosed. For a multiparameter process the functional safety factor is equal to the product of the functional safety factors of each diagnosed parameter. The proposed approach allows us to evaluate the functional safety of the technological process and controlled equipment at the operational stage at each time instant or for the given time interval as a single number, with the factor of the highest level of safety being equal to 1, when the safety level decreases the factor decreases and while failure the factor is equal to zero.",60068509,V.M.Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics,Kiev,Ukraine,"['1712', '1710']",28.9,-0.0967687074829932,0.31768707482993197,1

Since then the medical imaging has got advanced tremendously. Anyhow the methods of interpretation have started progressing only by the evolution of Computer aided Diagnosis(CAD). OBJECTIVES: To develop a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to detect the bone fracture which helps the radiologists (or) the Orthopaedics by interpreting the medical images in short duration. METHODS: In this paper, an effective automated bone fracture detection is proposed using enhanced Haar Wavelet Transform, Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and back propagation neural network. The former two techniques are used for feature extraction and the latter one is used for classification of fracture images. Simultaneously, the usage of enhanced Haar Wavelet Transforms and SIFT are phenomenally improves the quality of the X-ray image. Further in this work, k-means clustering based ‘Bag of Words’ methods are used to extract enhanced features extracted from SIFT. The classification phase of this proposed technique uses the classical back propagation neural network that contains 1024 neurons in 3-layers. RESULTS: The experimental validation of this proposed scheme performed using nearly 300 different bone fractures x-ray images confirmed a better classification rate of 93.4%.

491,491,Facial action units recognition by de-expression residue learning,"Understanding human facial expressions is one of the key steps to achieving human-computer interaction. However, the facial expression is a combination of an expressive component called facial behavior and a neutral component of a person. The most commonly used taxonomy to describe facial behaviors is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). FACS segments the visible effects of facial muscle activation into 30+ action units (AUs). So, we introduce a method to recognize AUs by extracting information of the expressive component through a de-expression learning procedure, called De-expression Residue Learning (DeRL). Firstly, we train a Generative Adversarial Network named cGAN to filter out the expressive information and generate the corresponding neutral face image. Then, we use the intermediate layers, which contains the action unit information, to recognition AUs. Our work alleviates problems of AUs recognition based on the pixel level difference, which is unreliable due to the variation between images i.e., rotation, translation and lighting condition changes, or the feature level difference, which is also unstable as the expression information may vary according to the identity information. As for experiments, we use the data augmentation method to avoid overfitting and trained deep network to recognition AUs on CK+ datasets.

The ozone spectra were recorded by low-noise microwave spectrometer MOS-4 with frequency resolution of 0.1 MHz and time resolution of 110 or 90 s, not quite evenly spaced in time. The spectra were averaged over groups of 6..60 ones. The OMR values at altitudes of 90 and 65 km were determined by the improved least-squares method applied to differences of brightness temperatures within ±0.5 MHz frequency offsets from the ozone line centre. Then special algorithm based on the Lomb periodograms with sliding data window was used to determine spectral power and frequencies of the ozone variations. Estimates of the OMR errors depending on the instrumental noise and number of averaged spectra were obtained by computer simulations and used to calculate detection thresholds of the Lomb algorithm. Wave-type variations in the OMR values with periods of 3..5 h were detected with probability of 85-90% at altitude of 90 km and 95-97% at 65 km.

503,503,Study of the influence of focal position on back-reflected radiation during deep penetration laser welding and its simulation,"A penetration laser welding mode characterized by formation of keyhole is often used. A small portion of the laser beam is reflected back from the keyhole and returned to the laser through the optical system of the welding head and optical fiber. The reflected radiation is monitored in the laser for the safety of the optical resonator and its signal can be read and used for process monitoring. The experiment was conducted to relate the intensity of the back-reflected radiation with depth and width of the weld for the variable focal position. The experiments were performed for two variants of the optical focusing system and materials with different thermo-physical properties-carbon steel and stainless steel. Furthermore, a mathematical model for back-reflected radiation was created using ray tracing. The shape of the keyhole was approximated as an inclined conical cavity. The results of the simulation were compared with experimentally measured data and it was found that the proposed model is most suitable for the description of stainless steel.",60017322,Institute of Scientific Instruments of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic,Brno,Czech Republic,['1706'],20.75,0.14444444444444446,0.3388888888888889,1

As good performance based on deep learning technology in depth estimation, more and more training models has emerged for depth estimation. Most existing works have required very promising results that belongs to supervised learning methods, but corresponding ground truth depth data for training is inevitable that makes training complicated. To overcome this limitation, an unsupervised learning framework is used for monocular depth estimation from videos, which contains depth map and pose network. In this paper, better results can be achieved by optimizing training models and improving training loss.

505,505,Employing automatic speech recognition for quantitative oral corrective feedback in Japanese second or foreign language education,"In Second or Foreign Language (SFL) education, a number of studies in applied linguistics have addressed a common issue of how teachers can provide effective feedback to correct learner's erroneous utterances during a classroom hour. Oral Corrective Feedback (OCF) is generally time-consuming and labor-intensive work for teachers. The use of ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) in SFL education has drawn attention from both teachers and learners to increase the learning effect and efficiency. We designed and integrated Quantitative OCF using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text as a part of the oral assessment using an LMS (Learning Management System) for Japanese SFL courses. The level of learners is a starter's level without any prerequisite knowledge of Japanese language. Preliminary experiments using a total of 214 audio datasets by non-native speakers exhibited that 37.4% of the datasets were recognized properly as Japanese sentences. However, as the remainder of the datasets contains erroneous utterances, characteristics of intonation, or noise, ASR successfully detected word-based errors with high accuracy (82.4%) but low precision (28.1%). Oral assessment employing ASR is highly promising as a complementary system for teachers on partially automating the assessment of audio data from learners with evidence and priority orders as well as significantly reducing teachers' scoring workload and time spent on the most problematic part of the students' speech. While our implementation still requires teachers to double-check, such overhead is small and affordable.",60103917,Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad,Hyderabad,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",25.333333333333332,0.03619047619047619,0.42095238095238097,1
506,506,Technology to improve the safety of choosing alternatives by groups of goals,"Recent scientific studies indicate the need to evaluate the alternatives for incomplete or fuzzy conditions where there are a lot of goals, each of which has its own set of criteria groups. Examples of such tasks are the assessing banking institutions to obtain a loan, making deposit funds or servicing; assessment of crowd-funding platforms by startups to obtain capital or by investors to finance their projects and many others. The research of the actual task of developing models for technology of increasing the safety of choosing alternative variants by the groups of goals was conducted. This technology builds a ranked series of alternatives relative to groups of goals and groups of criteria for goals, increases the safety of choosing alternatives and the objectivity of evaluating. This study uses the matrix multiplication method in the form of 7 step algorithm which allows one to operate with matrices of large dimensions, independently assesses the importance of criteria as to alternatives, reducing the experts subjectivity, does not require pairwise comparisons of alternatives and a lot of calculations. The concept of a ""satisfaction vector"" is introduced (an imaginary alternative in which estimates of coordinates by goals could satisfy a decision maker). A model for solving the problem of multi criteria choice of alternatives is proposed using the ""satisfaction vector"" which allows us to build a ranked series of alternatives represented by the evaluation vector. The final result is a general aggregate estimate of alternatives and their ranked series. An example of constructing a ""satisfaction vector"" for the task of choosing a bank institution by a business entity when obtaining loan funds or making deposit resources is described.

Unfortunately, while existing synthesis methods produce locally plausible results they often fail to respect global structure. This is exacerbated by a dearth of automated metrics for assessing terrain properties at a macro level. We address these issues by building on techniques from orometry, a field that involves the measurement of mountains and other relief features. First, we construct a sparse metric computed on the peaks and saddles of a mountain range and show that, when used for classification, this is capable of robustly distinguishing between different mountain ranges. Second, we present a synthesis method that takes a coarse elevation map as input and builds a graph of peaks and saddles respecting a given orometric distribution. This is then expanded into a fully continuous elevation function by deriving a consistent river network and shaping the valley slopes. In terms of authoring, users provide various control maps and are also able to edit, reposition, insert and remove terrain features all while retaining the characteristics of a selected mountain range. The result is a terrain analysis and synthesis method that considers and incorporates orometric properties, and is, on the basis of our perceptual study, more visually plausible than existing terrain generation methods.",60023578,Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1,Villeurbanne,France,['1704'],24.333333333333332,0.13026315789473686,0.41491228070175434,1

To optimize the selection of strides, the gating network is trained by reinforcement learning. The floating point operations per second (FLOPS) is significantly reduced by adapting the strides to convolutional layers without loss of accuracy.

In model checking, a formal technique of verification by exhaustive state space exploration, requirements must be stated in formal languages (most commonly, temporal logics) which are essentially supersets of the Boolean propositional logic. Translation of natural language requirements to these languages is a process which requires much knowledge and expertise in model checking as well the ability to correctly understand these requirements, and hence automating this process is desirable.

The framework mainly consists of two neural networks, i.e., HairSpatNet for inferring 3D spatial features of hair geometry from 2D image features, and HairTempNet for extracting temporal features of hair motions from video frames. The spatial features are represented as 3D occupancy fields depicting the hair volume shapes and 3D orientation fields indicating the hair growing directions. The temporal features are represented as bidirectional 3D warping fields, describing the forward and backward motions of hair strands cross adjacent frames. Both HairSpatNet and HairTempNet are trained with synthetic hair data.

Duma, et al., Surface imaging of metallic material fractures using optical coherence tomography, Appl. Opt. 53, 5912-5916 (2014); Gh. Hutiu, V.-F. Duma, et al., Assessment of ductile, brittle, and fatigue fractures of metals using optical coherence tomography, Metals 8, 117 (2018)]. The present paper presents the way we have demonstrated that OCT can replace the gold standard in such assessments, i.e. SEM, despite the fact that OCT has a resolution of 20 to 4 μm (in our investigations), while the SEM we employed has a 4 to 2 nm resolution. A few examples are given in this respect-for different types of fractures. The advantages of OCT versus SEM are discussed. This development opens the way for in situ investigations, for example in forensic sciences, where OCT can be applied (including with handheld scanning probes. as we have developed). In contrast, SEM, TEM, and AFM are lab-based techniques, more expensive, and they require trained operators.",60017524,Aurel Vlaicu University,Arad,Romania,['1706'],15.222222222222221,0.038903743315508006,0.36791443850267375,1

530,530,A robotic passive vision system for texture analysis in weld beads,"The use of robots is increasing in different industries, as in the case of large metal structures. The use of mobile robots meets the needs of these industries: it can be easily moved in the production line, with gains in repeatability and process efficiency, reducing rework costs. The poor configuration of the robotic and welding system generates problems in the internal structure and the surface of the weld, thus compromising the final quality of the piece. Visual inspections are common to identify problems that may have occurred during these processes. Inspections that use x-rays, ultrasound, or thermal cameras require additional equipment and highly trained inspectors to analyze the results and detect problems. This work presents a computer vision system based on a passive monocular camera for analysis of weld bead textures. Images of weld beads with and without discontinuities are captured and a dimensional reduction algorithm known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to select the main characteristics that describe each group. Afterward, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised learning method is applied to recognize the patterns of image groups, making it possible to classify new images of weld beads as welds with or without discontinuities. The system makes use of the same camera coupled to the robot responsible for conducting the welding, without the need for additional sensors, and assists the welding inspector in the evaluation of the performed process.",106431676,University of Rio Grande,Rio Grande,Brazil,"['1706', '1710']",25.77777777777778,0.034043290043290035,0.4776522366522366,1

The traditional global distinctiveness based saliency models usually compute the distinctiveness to measure saliency via comparing the difference of image patches in various spaces. In this paper, we propose to use an improved neural competition model to replace the comparison. The pairwise competition responses for a patch to all of the other patches are summed up to represent the distinctiveness of that patch. Particularly, the competition response is computed by a neural competition model with the dissimilarity bias and the gradient based feature inputs.

532,532,SocialEdge: Enabling trusted data processing workflow in smart communities,"In typical commercial cloud and edge providers data collection and processing nodes might be owned by a single trusted entity. In contrast, in a voluntary infrastructure, ownership is distributed. In such a setup, while individuals contributing data might demand constraints on how their data is accessed and used, volunteers of compute resources might want assurance that their resources are used only for intended purposes. These significant differences motivate SocialEdge, an edge orchestration framework that 1) leverages online social network for bootstrapping and permissioned block chain for information assurance, 2) exploits recursive containerization for enabling secure data access, ensuring only intended workloads are run and enforcing fine-grained resource control, and 3) leverages components from Kubernetes to instantiate and manage an ephemeral cluster composed of volunteered resources. In this paper we describe the design and prototype implementation of SocialEdge and model the problem of orchestrating the on-demand data processing infrastructure under data access constraints as a variant of the multi-commodity flow problem.

533,533,Event-related potential from EEG for a two-step identity authentication system,"Current problems related to high-level security access are increasing, leaving organizations and persons unsafe. A recent good candidate to create a robust identity authentication system is based on brain signals recorded with electroencephalograms (EEG). In this paper, EEG-based brain signals of 56 channels, from event-related potentials (ERPs), are used for Subject identification. The ERPs are from positive or negative feedback-related responses of a P300-speller system. The feature extraction part was done with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) extracting 2 intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) per channel, that were selected based on the Minkowski distance. After that, 4 features are computed per IMF; 2 energy features (instantaneous and teager energy) and 2 fractal features (Higuchi and Petrosian fractal dimension). Support vector machine (SVM) was used for the classification stage with an accuracy index computed using 10-folds cross-validation for evaluating the classifier's performance. Since high-density EEG information was available, the well-known backward-elimination and forward-addition greedy algorithms were used to reduce or increase the number of channels, step by step. Using the proposed method for subject identification from a positive or negative feedback-related response and then identify the subject will add a layer to improve the security system. The results obtained show that subject identification is feasible even using a low number of channels: E.g., 0.89 of accuracy using 5 channels with a mixed population and 0.93 with a male-only population.",60013141,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,"['1706', '1710']",22.6,0.024242424242424246,0.3702651515151515,1

Distance-bounding is a countermeasure widely studied in academic research but it has not transferred to commercial systems. Conventional communication channels cannot achieve the theoretical properties often required for the protocol to be secure and special channels might not be feasible to adopt. Our objective is to design 'best-effort' distance-bounding channels suitable for real RFID systems.

The main objective is to increase efficiency and productivity at a reasonable cost, which is lowered thanks to the robot lifespan. But not all the manual tasks, the tasks requiring high-level of dexterity, are yet replaced by robots. In fact, Europe is moving towards the creation of efficient workspaces where both robots and human operators can work safely. In this context, there is a clear intention of achieving solutions that involve collaborative robots, a.k.a. 'cobots' or co-robots, for permitting a safe interaction between robots and humans working for the same or interrelated processes. Many manufactures started to present their products but those arrived before the industry have clear and several needs of this particular technology. This article presents a human-robot collaborative assembly workstation, composed by the ABB YuMi robot that interacts with a human operation in order to assembly a product box, as a part of a large-scale process.

We describe a discrete version of these special surface parameterizations and show that they are very useful for specific applications, most of which are related to the design and fabrication of surfaces in architecture. With the new discrete surface model, it is easy to control strip widths between neighboring geodesics. This facilitates tasks such as cladding a surface with strips of originally straight flat material or designing geodesic gridshells and timber rib shells. It is also possible to model nearly developable surfaces. These are characterized by geodesic strips with almost constant strip widths and are used for generating shapes that can be manufactured from materials which allow for some stretching or shrinking like felt, leather, or thin wooden boards. Most importantly, we show how to constrain the strip width parameters to model a class of intrinsically symmetric surfaces. These surfaces are isometric to surfaces of revolution and can be covered with doubly-curved panels that are produced with only a few molds when working with flexible materials like metal sheets.",60018163,Technische Universitat Wien,Vienna,Austria,['1704'],23.625,0.11959199134199135,0.4546320346320346,1
538,538,Electro-optic modulators for photonic quantum information processing,"We introduce our recent photonic quantum information processing experiments using the high-speed electro-optic modulator (EOM) based on a lithium niobate waveguides. First, we demonstrated the frequency shifter for single photons by using an optical single sideband (OSSB) modulator, which is based on the nested configuration of four phase modulators (PMs). By properly setting the RF modulation signal and the bias voltage to each PM, we can suppress unwanted sidebands to realize a frequency shifter that can tune the frequency of single photons with accuracy of an RF synthesizer. Using the OSSB modulator, we eliminated the frequency distinguishability between two single photons whose frequencies were different by 25 GHz, and as a result observed a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with a visibility exceeding 90%. We also proposed and demonstrated a two-qubit controlled logic gate for time-bin qubits using a two-input, two-output optical switch. The switch enables us to individually perform different functions for two temporal bases as a time-dependent beam splitter, so that we can realize controlled-phase (C-Phase) gate for a time-bin qubit. We showed that the states of two separable single photons were entangled as a result of the C-Phase gate operation. We performed the quantum state tomography to obtain density matrices of the output states from the C-Phase gate for some specific input states, and confirmed that the averaged state fidelity to the pure states was 85%. These results indicate that the EOMs will be a useful tool for realizing advanced photonic quantum communication systems.",60025555,Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,Tokyo,Japan,['1706'],27.11111111111111,0.07544642857142858,0.348735119047619,1

The conventional method for a statistical monitoring model is principal component analysis (PCA). However, this is not sufficient to extract meaningful information in non-Gaussian data, which is the property of the process data in many industrial processes. Alternatively, the modified independent component analysis (MICA) method can be used to give meaningful information up to higher order statistics, which improves some drawbacks of independent component analysis (ICA) method. In this paper, we propose a protocol to monitor a chatter phenomenon in a hot strip mill process (HSMP) based on modified independent component analysis (MICA). First, we develop the chatter index (CI) that represent the degree of a chatter numerically. The statistical monitoring model for a chatter detection is constructed by using the chatter-free data, which is classified by CI.

Second, considering the size of the block to be repaired, a layered repair strategy is adopted.

With its increased usage in real-life scenarios, security, privacy and integrity of data in such environments have become critical. Malicious deletion of mission-critical data due to ransomware, trojans and viruses has been a huge menace and recovering such lost data is an active field of research. As most of Edge computing devices have compute and storage limitations, difficult constraints arise in providing an optimal scheme for data protection. These devices mostly use Linux/Unix based operating systems. Hence, this work focuses on extending the Ext4 file system to APEX (Adaptive Ext4): a file system based on novel on-the-fly learning model that provides an Adaptive Recover-ability Aware file allocation platform for efficient post-deletion data recovery and therefore maintaining data integrity. Our recovery model and its lightweight implementation allow significant improvement in recover-ability of lost data with lower compute, space, time, and cost overheads compared to other methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of APEX through a case study of overwriting surveillance videos by CryPy malware on Raspberry-Pi based Edge deployment and show 678% and 32% higher recovery than Ext4 and current state-of-the-art File Systems.

The proposed model determines the performance metrics for workload prior to the co-operation of autonomic computing characteristics. Thus, CBR provides optimal scheduling of resources and workload monitoring for cloud data centers. In order to validate the proposed CBR-based prediction model, we perform a series of experiments and evaluate the effectiveness in terms of precision, recall, f-measure, and mean square error rate.

This paper subdivides these four aspects, summarizes 10 evaluation indicators of supplier selection, and establishes a relatively scientific and reasonable index system. Then, the weight of each index is determined by analytic hierarchy process. For supplier processing, clustering analysis is used to classify supplier types. By comparing and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of three common-used clustering methods, this paper proposed an improved hierarchical clustering method, which can effectively determine the cluster center coordinates and improve the accuracy of supplier classification.

This headset includes a screen and lenses to produce this effect. This study uses VR in a training context to test if the quality of preparation for laboratories in engineering education can be improved. A virtual version of a second-year engineering lab was created to teach students the fundamental concepts involved, such that they are more prepared for the real lab. Unity was used to create the application, Blender was used to model the equipment, and Substance Painter was used to texture the models. Engineering students were tested before and after training, and their learning improvement measured. These students were split into two sets; the first used the VR, the second used the traditional briefing sheet. All students also answered a questionnaire to reflect their feelings on their given system of work. Students consistently showed a better improvement and therefore understanding of the lab when using VR.

Leveraging consumer devices to support already present grid control systems counter the growing grid instability. These devices may adapt their power consumption continuously, rather than erratic on-off switching, to provide a grid-friendly stabilization effect. Simulations with a grid model of Continental Europe and multiple consumer load control schemes with different consumer-impact levels were performed to analyze stabilization effect and user tolerability. The results show effective stabilization by the tested consumer load control schemes during a reference incident, allowing them to be used for various devices and device groups.

556,556,A comparative study of the spin-orbit interactions in Pancharatnam-Berry phase elements and in normal incidence of a light beam at a sharp interface," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Spin-controlled vortex generation is a manifestation of the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of light, which has been extensively studied in Pancharatnam-Berry geometric phase elements in recent years. The SOI under the normal incidence of a light beam at a sharp interface, also shown by a spin-dependent vortex, has attracted little attention, except for a few exceptions. Here, we establish a Fresnel Jones matrix to fully describe the dynamics of beam reflection and refraction at sharp interfaces under normal incidence. It is pointed out that the vortex phase originates from the topological structure of the beam itself and is essentially a spin-redirection Berry phase. Although the geometric phase in Pancharatnam-Berry elements comes from the anisotropy of the external material, which shows a fundamental difference, they are the same in form. We then give a comparative study of the two kinds of SOI, and reveal the intrinsic connection and difference between them. Our research not only establishes a unified framework to describe the two SOIs, but also offers a new perspective for studying the SOIs in other physics.",60023426,Hengyang Normal University,Hengyang,China,['1706'],26.428571428571427,0.03188131313131313,0.44654882154882153,0
557,557,"Designing actively secure, highly available industrial automation applications","Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) execute critical control software that drives Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). PLCs can become easy targets for cyber-adversaries as they are resource-constrained and are usually built using legacy, less-capable security measures. Security attacks can significantly affect system availability, which is an essential requirement for IACS. We propose a method to make PLC applications more security-aware. Based on the well-known IEC 61499 function blocks standard for developing IACS software, our method allows designers to annotate critical parts of an application during design time. On deployment, these parts of the application are automatically secured using appropriate security mechanisms to detect and prevent attacks. We present a summary of availability attacks on distributed IACS applications that can be mitigated by our proposed method. Security mechanisms are achieved using IEC 61499 Service-Interface Function Blocks (SIFBs) embedding Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), added to the application at compile time. This method is more amenable to providing active security protection from attacks on previously unknown (zero-day) vulnerabilities. We test our solution on an IEC 61499 application executing on Wago PFC200 PLCs.

561,561,Understanding human decision-making during production ramp-up using natural language processing,"Ramping up a manufacturing system from being just assembled to full-volume production capacity is a time consuming and error-prone task. The full behaviour of a system is difficult to predict in advance and disruptions that need to be resolved until the required performance targets are reached occur often. Information about the experienced faults and issues might be recorded, but usually, no record of decisions concerning necessary physical and process adjustments are kept. Having these data could help to uncover significant insights into the ramp-up process that could reduce the effort needed to bring the system to its mandatory state. This paper proposes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret human operator comments collected during ramp-up. Recurring patterns in their feedback could be used to gain a deeper understanding of the cause and effect relationship between the system state and the corrective action that an operator applied. A manual dispensing experiment was conducted where human assessments in form of unstructured free-form text were gathered.

A novel architecture is conceptualized around the usage of the Actor Model, especially in the area of edge and cloud computing. The administration shell can be either implemented by an asset that is OPC-UA ready or be mapped to a gateway in the device (service) cloud. The administration shell implemented with the Actor Model (predominantly for the public and private cloud) consists of four modules: the components module (describing the corresponding system), the publish-subscribe module, the additional logic module (conditions, alarms), and the interaction module (behavior). The main idea is to reuse an OPC-UA compliant implementation for the internal actor logic. At the device cloud level, IT/OT entities can be composed together in a domain specific point of view. This is implemented over three abstractions levels (data acquisition, data analytics and control monitoring).

568,568,Indoor localization services for hearing aids using bluetooth low energy,"BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is a common disorder which is usually treated with hearing aids. The context of use, whether being outside, inside of large or small rooms, in a quiet or noisy environment, or talking with someone near or at a distance, often requires the hearing aid user to adjust the settings of the hearing aids manually in order to reach an optimal or even acceptable hearing experience. Knowing the context of a hearing aid user in the home setting, including the position within the home, could likely automate and optimize relevant hearing aid settings as needed. Several modern hearing aids are already equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) antennas enabling their connectivity with smartphones and other compatible devices. This allows for the development of positioning and localization services using BLE. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of using the BLE radio signal of hearing aids to provide indoor localization and positioning support when used in combination with fixed radio access points in a home setting. METHODS: A research platform based on a single Oticon hearing aid and three embedded Raspberry Pi computers placed at three strategic locations in a home setting was developed. The Raspberry Pis used the two statistical learning methods K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees for non-obtrusive detection, classification, and determination of the location of the hearing aid. The efficacy of the research platform was evaluated during two hearing experience relevant efficacy studies: 1) room classification and 2) proximity detection of hearing aid users to their conversation partners. RESULTS: Room classification results provided an accuracy of 88.79% and it was found feasible and reliable to differentiate whether the hearing aid user was within a comfortable conversation distance or not. CONCLUSION: These results open up for a wide range of audiological applications in indoor environments for supporting new context-aware services for improving the hearing experience of the users.",60029616,Aarhus Universitet,Aarhus,Denmark,['1701'],28.636363636363637,0.05235742518351214,0.4459015622059101,1

Typical problem is numerical aperture limitation of the interferometer transmission element. Aspheric surfaces are also problematic due a significant shape deviation from the illumination wavefront. This deviation typically causes vignetting and spatial aliasing on the camera. A solution is sub-aperture measurement and subsequent subaperture stitching. A stitching algorithm in principle uses overlaps between sub-apertures to eliminate aberrations of each sub-aperture to obtain a full-aperture for further analysis. This process is computation time demanding and an optimization has to be implemented in order to obtain result in reasonable time. In this paper, descriptions of considered aberrations using Zernike polynomials are presented and the stitching method based on linear equation system is proposed and it is mathematically described.

In this paper, we present a deep learning model developed for detecting sequential driver mental workload using physiological signals. We modify a fully convolutional U-Net in order to learn from multiple temporal physiological signals as inputs. We also demonstrate that the element-wise cross-entropy loss function, which has been adopted by many other deep learning architectures for classification or segmentation purposes, is not sufficient for the sequential workload segmentation because it treats each data point as an independent classification object while ignoring the neighboring relation between the points. We introduce a new loss function that is sensitive to local continuity property in workload sequence. The proposed method is evaluated on two sets of data collected by wearable sensors to record multiple physiological signals. The effectiveness of an introduced scalar used to control the influence of the continuity-aware loss is investigated. Our experiments show that the proposed U-Net is effective in detecting sequential human mental workload.

579,579,Efficient spectral confocal meta-lens in the near infrared,"Spectral confocal technology is an important three-dimensional measurement technology with high accuracy and non-contact; however, traditional spectral confocal system usually consists of prisons and several lens whose volume and weight is enormous and heavy, besides, due to the chromatic aberration characteristics of ordinary optical lenses, it is difficult to perfectly focus light in a wide bandwidth. Meta-surfaces are expected to realize the miniaturization of conventional optical element due to its superb abilities of controlling phase and amplitude of wavefront of incident at subwavelength scale, and in this paper, an efficient spectral confocal meta-lens (ESCM) working in the near infrared spectrum (1300nm-2000nm) is proposed and numerically demonstrated. ESCM can focus incident light at different focal lengths from 16.7 to 24.5µm along a perpendicular off-axis focal plane with NA varying from 0.385 to 0.530. The meta-lens consists of a group of Si nanofins providing high polarization conversion efficiency lager than 50%, and the phase required for focusing incident light is well rebuilt by the resonant phase which is proportional to the frequency and the wavelength-independent geometric phase, PB phase.

The existing SPI-based depth imaging systems utilize multiple single-pixel detectors to capture multi-angle images, or introduce depth modulation devices such as optical grating to achieve three-dimensional imaging. The methods require bulky systems and high computational complexity. In this paper, we present a novel and efficient three-dimensional SPI method that does not require any additional hardware compared to the conventional SPI system. Specifically, a multiplexing illumination strategy combining random and sinusoidal pattern is proposed, which is able to simultaneously encode the target's spatial and depth information into a measurement sequence captured by a single-pixel detector. To decode the three-dimensional information from one-dimensional measurements, we built and trained a deep convolutional neural network.

581,581,An approach to efficient test scheduling for automated production systems,"In order to guarantee a high availability and reliability, automated production systems are tested thoroughly after changes were introduced. As test resources like testing time are limited, the tester has to select the test cases for the test execution thoughtfully. This becomes quite challenging as the complexity of automated production systems and the number of related test cases increases. It results in a high risk to miss important test cases and to waste valuable test resources by executing redundant or less important test cases. Automatic test case prioritisation can assist the tester in distinguishing between important and less important test cases. However to achieve an efficient test execution schedule, the test case selection as well as the running order have to be well conceived. Especially for automated production systems, there are many constraints and challenges to consider such as manual testing, setup time between test cases and effects upon test case failure. Therefore, an approach for an efficient test scheduling method is proposed in the paper that utilises the available resources as best as possible while maximizing the amount of the resulting information.

By adopting liquid cooling, the rising demand of high heat flux devices can be met while the reliability of the microelectronic devices can also be improved to a greater extent. Liquid cooled cold plates are largely replacing air based heat sinks for electronics in data center applications, thanks to its large heat carrying capacity. A bench level study was carried out to characterize the thermohydraulic performance of microchannel cold plates which uses warm De-Ionized (DI) water for cooling Multi Chip Modules (MCM). A laboratory built mock package housing mock chips and a heat spreader was employed while assessing the thermal performance of three different cold plate designs at varying coolant flow rate and temperature. The case temperature measured at the heat spreader for varying flow rates and input power were essential in identifying the convective resistance corresponding to the cold plates. The flow performance was evaluated by the measuring the pressure drop across cold plate module at varying flow rates. Cold plate with the enhanced microchannel design yielded better results compared to a traditional parallel microchannel design.

Therefore, it still needs high computational cost especially for stereo images with large disparity search range. We proposes an efficient semi-global matching method that disparity search range is reduced based on 3D plane fitting. Firstly, the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted to segment the stereo images. Secondly, the dense SIFT keypoints are extracted and matched from the left and right images. Thirdly, similar adjacent superpixels are merged based on the gray mean and variance, and for each merged region, 3-D plane is fitted based on matched keypoints. Finally, the pixel-wise disparity search range is limited into several pixels for more-global matching method which can reduce the computational complexity and obtain an accurate disparity map. Experimental results demonstrate that the computational speed of the new semi-global matching method is several times faster than that of the original method, as well as offering a more accurate disparity map.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,['1706'],23.625,0.18471981721981723,0.4257900432900433,1

Therefore the soft robotic arm that is stretchable, light weight, softness without possible of hazards, and high precision control is suitable to deploy in human life. Thus the purpose of this research is to develop the soft robotic arm by using antagonistic pneumatic driven system.

They have their weaknesses compared with other forecasting methods, however. For example, they may fail in many new situations not experienced before. Hybrid models are increasingly popular as they are capable of combining the strengths of several modelling methods and mitigating the weaknesses. We study short-term forecasting of aggregated electricity demand that includes dynamically controlled thermal storage. Purely measurement data driven models tend to fail in forecasting power in rarely occurring situations, such as dynamic load control actions and extreme weather. The thermal dynamics of the loads, large outdoor temperature variations, and changes in the energy technologies contribute to this challenge. Combining various information sources and the strengths of different modelling approaches is needed. We study the following approach using field trial data covering over 7500 houses and 27 months. We forecast control responses and load saturation using models that have physically based model structures. Then we forecast the residual using data driven models, such as machine learning models designed and tuned to learn also system dynamics. The load forecast is the sum of these component forecasts.

598,598,Using multi-agent systems for demand response aggregators: Analysis and requirements for the development,"Demand response is an important mechanism to support the integration of renewable energies. It helps to stabilize the power grid by controlling energy consumption and generation at strategic times. There are different demand response markets and different ways to gain access to these markets but all have one thing in common: increasing or decreasing the load of the power grid on the consumer side. In order to offer this, demand response providers must be able to offer flexibility in their energy consumption and/or generation, and also technical and market wise. Demand response providers are often accumulated in a virtual power plant and managed by demand response aggregators. These aggregators pool and manage technical units of industrial manufacturers that can provide energy flexibility and establish the connection to the demand response markets. The management of these loads is a complex task with great optimization potential. This distributed system is subject to various technical and organizational requirements, depending on the market the provider supplies.

Imaging through inhomogeneous samples, like ground glass, is regarded as a difficult challenge. Here, we propose a method to estimate the number of hidden targets and the pose of multi-targets hidden behind scattering medium by analyzing the distribution of autocorrelation of multi-targets speckle. The autocorrelation of multi-targets includes two parts, the autocorrelation of each sub-target and the cross-correlation among all targets. When multi-targets locate in the same row, the speckle autocorrelation shows a line shape. The autocorrelation of each sub-target overlaps on the center position and the crosscorrelations among them symmetrically distribute at both sides. When multi-targets distribute in different rows and columns, the speckle autocorrelation arranges symmetrically around the center. The autocorrelation of each sub-target overlaps on the center, and the cross-correlations among sub-targets symmetrically distribute around. The relative location among multi-targets can be estimated by calculating the distance from the cross-correlations of two sub-targets. Both simulation and experiment results successfully prove that our method possesses the ability to reconstruct multitargets in different column and cow within optical memory effect (OME) range.

601,601,The Carbon Balance Observatory (CARBO) instrument for remote sensing of greenhouse gases from space,"We present the current development of the Carbon Balance Observatory (CARBO). CARBO is a wide-swath mapping, low Earth orbit (LEO) new generation of instruments that expands on the ground-breaking CO2 and Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF) measurements pioneered by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2/3) by adding CH4 and CO detection. The instrument's spatial coverage is delivered at 2 km by 2 km resolution with a field-of-view of 10° to 15° from LEO for a ∼200 km wide swath. It achieves roughly 20x better spatial coverage than the OCO-2 instrument, and 3x better Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) detection sensitivity, in a smaller package. CARBO will measure CO2 at <1.5 ppm, CH4 at <7 ppb, CO at <5 ppb and SIF < 20%. The measurement of CO2/CH4/CO/SIF at these concentrations will significantly increase our ability to disentangle carbon fluxes into their constituent components. CARBO utilizes innovative immersion grating technology and enables high resolving power spectroscopy (roughly 20,000) in a smaller and lighter package that is more cost effective than current space-based CO2 remote sensing instruments. CARBO modules cover 4 different spectral ranges (from 740 nm to 2.3μm), where two channels will be built and field tested.

To join the Smart Factory Web, participants describe their factory capabilities, which are modelled in an ontology. AutomationML is used to assist with this modelling. OPC UA is used as a communication protocol for factory live-data from the machines. However, factory owners are hesitant to share critical production data. Therefore, the communication has to be secure and in the best case, provide control mechanisms for the data owners.

603,603,Determining input variable ranges given a trained regression model and an output range,"Industrial process control systems try to keep an output variable within a given tolerance around a target value. PID control systems have been widely used in industry to control input variables in order to reach this goal. However, this kind of Transfer Function based approach cannot be extended to complex processes where input data might be non-numeric, high dimensional, sparse, etc. In such cases, there is still a need for determining the subspace of input data that produces an output within a given range. This paper presents a non-stochastic approximation to determine input values for a mathematical function or trained regression model given an output range. The proposed method creates a synthetic training data set of input combinations with a class label that indicates whether the output is within the given target range or not. Then, a decision tree classifier is used to determine the subspace of input data of interest. This method is more general than a traditional controller as the target range for the output does not have to be centered around a reference value and it can be applied given a regression model of the output variable, which may have categorical variables as inputs and may be high dimensional, sparse... The proposed method is validated with a proof of concept on a real use case where the quality of a lamination factory is established to identify the suitable subspace of production variable values.",60086943,VICOMTech,Donostia-San Sebastian,Spain,"['1706', '1710']",26.22222222222222,0.15166666666666667,0.5066666666666667,1

The conditions are realized at different information content in the class of quasi- and stroboscope strategics based on ideas of the method of resolving functions using the inverse Minkowski functionals. Many-valued mappings and their selections represent mathematical apparatus of investigation. The specific feature of the problem which the paper deals with is that generally speaking the classic Pontryagin condition does not hold. Here special shifting functions play the role of Ponlryagin selection and instead of resolving functions the upper and the lower resolving functions of two kinds are applied that allow the convergence process to be realized in a finite time. Above mentioned innovation allows essential extension of the class of game problems which are susceptible to analysis on the basis of the resolving functions ideology under the main method constructions. In particular it becomes possible to encompass the processes with discontinuous trajectories functioning in condition of conflict and uncertainty.",60068509,V.M.Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics,Kiev,Ukraine,"['1712', '1710']",24.285714285714285,0.039010989010989,0.3407509157509158,1
605,605,An approach to retrieve BRDF from satellite and airborne measurements of surface-reflected radiance based on decoupling of atmospheric radiative transfer and surface reflection,Bi-directional Reflection Distribution Function (BRDF) defines anisotropy of the surface reflection. It is required to specify the boundary condition for radiative transfer (RT) modeling. Measurements of reflected radiance by satellite-and air-borne sensors provide information about anisotropy of surface reflection. Atmospheric correction needs to be performed to derive BRDF from the reflected radiance. Common approach for BRDF retrievals consists of the use of kernel-based BRDF and RT modeling that needs to be done anew at every step of the iterative process. The kernels' weights are obtained by minimization of the difference between measured and modeled radiance. This study develops a new method of retrieving kernel-based BRDF that requires RT calculations to be done only once. The method employs the exact analytical expression of radiance at any atmospheric level through the solutions to two auxiliary atmosphere-only RT problems and the surface-reflected radiance at the surface level. The latter is related to BRDF and solutions to the auxiliary RT problems by a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The approach requires to perform RT calculations one time before the iterations. It can use observations taken at different atmospheric conditions assuming that surface conditions remain unchanged during the time span of observations. The algorithm accurately catches zero weights of the kernels that may be a concern if the number of kernels is greater than 3 in current mainstream approaches. The study presents numerical tests of the BRDF retrieval algorithm for various surface and atmospheric conditions.,60000984,"Science Systems and Applications, Inc.

608,608,Detection of machine tool anomalies from bayesian changepoint recurrence estimation,"In this study, we consider the problem of detecting process-related anomalies for machine tools. The similar shape of successive sensor signals, which arises due to the same process step sequence applied to each workpiece, suggests extracting shape-related features. In recent years, shapelets dominated the field of shape-related features. Unfortunately, they involve a high computational burden due to hyperparameter optimization.We introduce alternative shape-related features relying on abrupt signal changes (changepoints) reflecting the changes of process steps. During normal operation, changepoints follow a highly recurrent pattern, i.e., appear at similar locations. Thus, being able to distinguish regular, recurrent from abnormal, non-recurrent changepoints allows detecting process anomalies.For changepoint recurrence estimation, we extend the Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) method. The extension allows distinguishing normal and abnormal changepoints relying on empirical estimates of the changepoint recurrence distribution. Subsequently, changepoint-related features are introduced and compared to shapelets and wavelet-based features in a case study comprising real-world machine tool data.Qualitative results verify changepoint locations being comparable to shapelet locations found by the FLAG shapelet approach. Furthermore, quantitative results suggest superior classification performance both to shapelets and wavelet-based features.",60024260,Universität Siegen,Siegen,Germany,"['1706', '1710']",20.22222222222222,0.06147058823529411,0.4739366515837103,1

In this domain, autonomous coverage of areas is of vital importance, for improving both the quality and the efficiency of coverage. This paper leverages human expertise in river exploration and data collection strategies to automate and optimize these processes using autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). In particular, three deterministic algorithms for both partial and complete coverage of a river segment are proposed, providing varying path length, coverage density, and turning patterns. These strategies resulted in increases in accuracy and efficiency compared to human performance. The proposed methods were extensively tested in simulation using maps of real rivers of different shapes and sizes. In addition, to verify their performance in real world operations, the algorithms were deployed successfully on several parts of the Congaree River in South Carolina, USA, resulting in total of more than 35km of coverage trajectories in the field.",60018179,University of South Carolina,Columbia,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.0,0.1392156862745098,0.3950980392156862,1
610,610,No-reference quality assessment for synthesized images based on local geometric distortions,"Depth-image-based-rendering (DIBR) techniques are significant for view synthesis. However, such technique may introduce challenging distortions. Unlike traditional uniform artifacts, the distortions of the synthesized could be local and non-uniform, thus are challenging for traditional image quality assessment metrics. To tackle this problem, aiming at the geometric distortions, a no reference quality assessment for DIBR-synthesized images is proposed in this paper. First, considering that the hue distribution of disoccluded regions is different from that of the natural image, the disoccluded regions are extracted from the hue difference map. The disoccluded regions with different sizes are calculated adaptively by overlapping the hue difference map according to the distortion intensity based on the progressive layer partitioning principle. Second, the artifacts of edges are measured as the distance between the patches at critical regions and their down-sampled versions based on the property of scale invariance. Finally, the perceptual quality is estimate by linearly pooling the scores of two geometric distortions together. The experimental results show that the PLCC, SRCC, RMSE of the proposed model are 0.7613, 0.6965, and 0.4244, respectively. In summary, the proposed metric achieves higher performance, but lower computational complexity than other models.",60031991,Chongqing University of Technology,Chongqing,China,['1706'],19.1,0.10833333333333334,0.5546296296296296,1

617,617,PowerStar: Improving power efficiency in heterogenous processors for bursty workloads with approximate computing,"Modern Data Centers have increasingly adopted heterogeneous processors in their server nodes to maximize power efficiency. However, there are still challenges in how to properly configure these processors such that throughput can be maximized under fluctuating workload while optimizing system power consumption. In this paper, we propose PowerStar, a framework that maximizes power efficiency and reduces the number of reconfigurations needed in heterogeneous processors during periods of fluctuations in job arrival patterns while handling latency-critical workloads. PowerStar is built based on the following two key observations: (i) reconfiguration of heterogeneous processors to add more cores and enable higher performance and/or re-allocation of computing cores can be costly due to the extra latency involved and the associated energy overheads; (ii) a considerable amount of energy savings can be achieved by keeping the system in most power-efficient configurations capable of absorbing short bursts in job arrivals without needing to reconfigure the system. PowerStar operates by carefully choosing the most power-efficient configurations (states) and judiciously maximizing the state residency through the controlled use of approximate computing, when feasible. We implement PowerStar as a prototype on a 6-core ARM big.LITTLE heterogeneous platform and evaluate it with a variety of workloads. Our results show that, compared to a baseline of performance-driven power management policy, our power efficiency-aware PowerStar can reduce the average power by up to 11% under tight QoS (95th percentile latency under 3× job execution latency), and can save even higher average power of up to 32% under relaxed QoS (95th percentile latency under 10× job execution latency) constraints when compared to the baseline.",60022144,University of Central Florida,Orlando,United States,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",37.285714285714285,0.03847402597402598,0.4891233766233766,1

However, this process is laborious and in many cases no 3D-CAD model is available. Also, setting up a simulation might require substantial efforts or might even be infeasible. This article focuses on the machine learning based estimation of the remaining useful life of unknown, derived motor types of an electric motor class based on simulations of known motor types, as well as data sheets and measurements. In particular, we propose the hybrid fusion method moSAIc that allows to transfer the knowledge inherent in physical degradation models of motors to unknown instances.

However, due to the lack of SWIR in high-resolution multispectral images, such as ZY-3 satellite imagery, traditional SWIR-based methods are no longer practical. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of cloud and snow detection, in this work, we propose an effective convolutional neural network (CNN) with a multilevel/scale feature fusion module (MFFM), a channel and spatial attention module, and an encoder-decoder network structure for cloud and snow detection form ZY-3 satellite imageries. The MFFM can aggregate multiple-level/scale feature maps from the backbone network, ResNet50, for providing representative semantic feature information for cloud and snow detection. Channel and spatial attention module (CSAM) is used to further refine the semantic feature maps that outputs by MFFM thus making the network have better detection performance.

628,628,A testbed and an experimental public dataset for energy-harvested IoT solutions,"The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm poses a great variety of application domains where million of devices work uninterruptedly to improve some aspect of our lives. To support the continuous execution of the applications working on the devices, energy harvesting systems enable to extract the energy found naturally in the environment (for instance from the sun or from the wind) and convert it into energy able to either sustain the device's operation and recharge its batteries which, in conjunction with an appropriate scheduling strategy, led to the device to an electrically sustainable state (i.e. an energy-neutral state). Most of the works found in literature oriented to achieve energy neutrality are however evaluated by means of simulation which means that, in spite of precisely modeling hardware features and energy productions, lack of the realism that we find in a real deployment. A minor part of the works are based on a real deployment but do not share the collected data that permit to replicate the analysis. With this purpose in mind, in this article we describe a testbed designed for outdoor monitoring purposes in the IoT context, equipped with several sensors for weather conditions monitoring and with a solar panel to provide application lifetimes potentially infinite. The testbed was deployed on the roof of a building and it executed uninterruptedly an application able to generate a dataset with the collected information over a period of more than two months.

629,629,Security in wireless sensor networks: A formal verification of protocols,"The increase of the digitalization taking place in various industrial domains is leading developers towards the design and implementation of more and more complex networked control systems (NCS) supported by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). This naturally raises new challenges for the current WSN technology, namely in what concerns improved guarantees of technical aspects such as real-time communications together with safe and secure transmissions. Notably, in what concerns security aspects, several cryptographic protocols have been proposed. Since the design of these protocols is usually error-prone, security breaches can still be exposed and MALICIOUSly exploited unless they are rigorously analyzed and verified. In this paper we formally verify, using ProVerif, three cryptographic protocols used in WSN, regarding the security properties of secrecy and authenticity. The security analysis performed in this paper is more robust than the ones performed in related work. Our contributions involve analyzing protocols that were modeled considering an unbounded number of participants and actions, and also the use of a hierarchical system to classify the authenticity results.

Here, we develop a model that can describe the growth of the user population of a newly launched product or service, which can answer this question. To develop this model, we consider a network of interacting individuals, whose actions or transitions are determined by the states (behaviour) of their neighbours as well as their own personal decisions. This model leads to a simple growth equation connecting the growth of user population with the total number of prospective users, and the effects of peer influence and personal choice.

In the light of this background, our team thought that a workshop program for staff members of these facilities is basic but is a practical solution. Then, we tried to conduct a workshop collaborating with Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. The workshop mainly focused on the experiences of how these impaired people feel when they receive explanations in cultural facilities. Participants touched tactile material while wearing an eye-mask, listened to a lecture with earphones that produce multi-talker noise, etc. After the workshop, they were required to answer several questionnaires and make comments. The results show that the participants were satisfied with the workshop program, felt they needed more time to acquire information, and would like to recommend the learning experience to their colleagues.

635,635,Minimizing age of information for real-time monitoring in resource-constrained industrial IoT networks,"This paper considers an Industrial Internet of Thing (IIoT) system with a source monitoring a dynamic process with randomly generated status updates. The status updates are sent to an designated destination in a real-time manner over an unreliable link. The source is subject to a practical constraint of limited average transmission power. Thus, the system should carefully schedule when to transmit a fresh status update or retransmit the stale one. To characterize the performance of timely status update, we adopt a recent concept, Age of Information (AoI), as the performance metric. We aim to minimize the long-term average AoI under the limited average transmission power at the source, by formulating a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problem. To address the formulated CMDP, we recast it into an unconstrained Markov Decision Process (MDP) through Lagrangian relaxation. We prove the existence of optimal stationary policy of the original CMDP, which is a randomized mixture of two deterministic stationary policies of the unconstrained MDP. We also explore the characteristics of the problem to reduce the action space of each state to significantly reduce the computation complexity. We further prove the threshold structure of the optimal deterministic policy for the unconstrained MDP. Simulation results show the proposed optimal policy achieves lower average AoI compared with random policy, especially when the system suffers from stricter resource constraint. Besides, the influence of status generation probability and transmission failure rate on optimal policy and the resultant average AoI as well as the impact of average transmission power on the minimal average AoI are unveiled.",60025709,The University of Sydney,Sydney,Australia,"['1706', '1710']",21.416666666666668,-0.11304761904761904,0.4664285714285715,1
636,636,"Vallum: Privacy, confidentiality and access controlfor sensitive data in cloud environments","Managing sensitive data in shared environments such as public clouds is an enduring challenge. While several approaches exist to protect data at rest such as end-to-end encryption, there exist only a few solutions such as homomorphic encryption that offer secure data processing. Unfortunately, these solutions cannot be used in practice as they incur non-negligible run-time overheads and security risks. Moreover, as the majority of data management systems were designed to operate in private cloud environments, which are under the control of the data owner, they often lack appropriate mechanisms for access control as well as privacy assurance. In this paper we propose Vallum, a data access and protection layer that closes these gaps while enabling users to operate data management systems in shared environments such securely as public clouds. Vallum utilizes Intel SGX and remote attestation to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data being stored and processed. Furthermore, it provides access protection and privacy assurance through a extensible architecture.

Inspired by the structure of human retina, we propose the hypothesis that the central area of the image contains more significant information than the marginal one. Comprehensive experiments are presented to prove that hypothesis and reach the conclusion that the receptive field is nonuniform. The central part of the image that is always selected by translation is called the focused area. Motivated by the demand to take use of different focused area and thus take use of different receptive fields, we propose a novel training mechanism that integrate different focused areas in one training process. Our method consists of several stages, each has its own focused area and learning rate, and achieves considerable result in the experiments.

638,638,Things as a service: Service model for IoT,"Leveraging the benefits of service computing technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) can help in rapid system development, composition and deployment. But due to the massive scale, computational and communication constraints, existing software service models cannot be directly applied for IoT based systems. Service discovery and composition mechanism need to be decentralized unlike majority of other service models. Moreover, IoT services' interfaces require to be light weight and able to expose the device profile for seamless discovery onto the IoT based system infrastructure. In addition to this, the 'things' data should be associated with its present context. To address these issues, this paper proposes a formal model for IoT services. The service model includes the physical property of 'things' and exposes it to the user. It also associates the context with the 'things' output, which in turn helps in extracting relevant information from the 'things' data. To evaluate our IoT service model, a weather monitoring system and its associated services are implemented using node.js [31].

639,639,State-estimation for delay-management in distributed real-time co-simulation via the internet,"Typical distributed embedded real-time systems are composed of several subsystems developed by different, geographically distributed manufacturers. During the development process, these subsystems have to be integrated via real-time communication networks and tested. The verification can be simplified combining co-simulation and Software- and Hardware-In-The-Loop (SIL/HIL) testing in a distributed co-simulation framework. In such a framework, software (SIL) and hardware (HIL) components can be tested against the model of a simulated plant. This way it is possible to detect design faults and integration problems while the subsystems are still located at their manufacturers' sites.Real-time systems impose strict temporal and reliability requirements on the communication network connecting the subsystems. However, these requirements cannot be achieved using the Internet for communication in the distributed co-simulation framework. In this paper we introduce state-estimation as a delay-management technique to provide required subsystem inputs in time. Based on previous outputs and a simulation model of the remaining system, the mechanism estimates a subsystem's future inputs. Using scheduling information about the real-time communication in the system, the framework can determine if an input packet is received in time. If not, the estimated packet is forwarded. As soon as the real input packet is received later, its content is compared with the estimated input and the operator is notified if the error between estimated and real input exceeds a configurable threshold.",60024260,Universität Siegen,Siegen,Germany,"['1706', '1710']",20.181818181818183,0.015151515151515155,0.34469696969696967,1

In the past, researchers used hand-craft features to detect targets in satellite images. With the rapid growth of deep learning, neural networks such as Faster R-CNN, YOLO, SSD and RetinaNet can detect targets precisely and quickly. Traditional camouflage is designed to make important targets hard to identify. So whether the satellite image target camouflage is still effective with deep learning target detection? In this paper, we use YOLO v3 and RetinaNet to verify the effectiveness of camouflage and propose an improved YOLO v3 to enhance detection efficiency, which raise the detection speed from 34.5fps to 55.3fps in an image of 416*416.

The problem is particularly challenging when only of a limited number of spectral bands is available, and thermal infrared bands are lacking. This is the case of Proba-V instrument, for which the European Space Agency (ESA) carried out a dedicated Round Robin exercise, aimed at intercomparing several cloud detection algorithms to better understand their advantages and drawbacks for various clouds and surface conditions, and to learn lessons on cloud detection in the VNIR and SWIR domain for land and coastal water remote sensing. The present contribution is aimed at a thorough quality assessment of the results of the cloud detection approach we proposed, based on Cumulative Discriminant Analysis. Such a statistical method relies on the empirical cumulative distribution function of the measured reflectance in clear and cloudy conditions to produce a decision rule.

649,649,No-reference image quality assessment based on an objective quality database and deep neural networks,"Image quality assessment (IQA) has always been an active research topic since the birth of the digital image. Actually, the arrival of deep learning has made IQA more promising. However, most state-of-the-art no-reference (NR) IQA methods require regression training on distorted images or extracted features with subjective image scores, which makes them suffer from insufficient reference image content and training samples with subjectively scoring due to timeconsuming and laborious subjective testing. Furthermore, most convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based methods generally transform original images into patches to accommodate fixed-size input of CNN, which often alter the image's data and introduce noise into the neural network. This paper aims to solve the above problems by adopting new strategies and proposes a novel NRIQA method based on deep CNN. Specifically, first, we obtain image data with diverse image content, multiple image sizes, and reasonable distortion by crawling, filtrating, and degrading numerous publicly licensed high-quality images from the Internet. Then, we score all the images using an excellent full-reference (FR) IQA algorithm, thereby artificially construct a large objective IQA database. Next, we design a deep CNN, which can accept input images of original sizes from our database instead of patches, then we train the model with the FRIQA index as training objective thus propose the opinionunaware(OU) NRIQA method. Finally, the experiment results show that our method achieves excellent performance, which outperforms state-of-the-art OU-NRIQA models and is comparable to most of the traditional opinion-aware NRIQA methods, even some FRIQA methods on standard subjective IQA databases.",60018308,Xi'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an,China,['1706'],27.666666666666668,0.15444737554112553,0.44400365259740254,1

With center-surrounded receptive fields, the human visual system (HVS) can reduce the visual redundancy by extracting the edges and contours of objects. Furthermore, current researches on image quality assessment (IQA) have shown that human's perception of image quality can be estimated by the correlation degree between the extracted perceptual-aware features of the reference and test images. Thus, this paper assesses the quality of a video by measuring the similarity of perceptual-aware features from LOG filtering between the test video and reference video. Considering the spatial and temporal channel of the human visual system both include the second derivative of Gaussian function, we first construct a three-dimensional LOG (3D LOG) filter to simulate human visual filter and to extract the perceptual-aware features for the design of VQA algorithms. Moreover, since the correlation measuring based on 2D LOG filtering of video spatiotemporal slice (STS) images can capture the distortion of spatiotemporal motion structure accurately and effectively, then we apply the 2D LOG filtering to video STS images and using maximum pooling for distortion of vertical and horizontal STS images to improve prediction accuracy. The performance of proposed algorithms is validated on the LIVE VQA database.

The paper also provides a survey of modern methods and approaches to group control, discusses the use of methods for optimizing collective behavior, artificial potential fields, heuristic methods based on the recognition of the situation and the development of appropriate actions and methods based on the use of fuzzy logic. It is shown that when applying these methods, the problem of analyzing the stability of the obtained closed-loop control system is complex. From the survey of modern methods, the basic conditions imposed on the synthesized law of group control of robots are highlighted. These conditions are adaptability to the external environment and asymptotically stable movement of mobile robots to a given point in space with a given type of order. Therefore, the paper presents a method which is based on new non-linear approaches to the control of mobile robots' group, in particular, synergetic control theory.

654,654,Application of hydrometer profiles from microwave imagers in typhoon numerical simulation,"Cloudiness and precipitation are important output parameters in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, both for their own sake and because they strongly affect other parameters, e.g., surface temperature. The spin-up problem is an important reason resulting in low accuracy of forecasts during the early prediction stage (0-6 h), so it's necessary to introduce cloud-related information to eliminate or weaken this problem. For typhoon prediction, microwave satellite data is crucial. Profiles of cloud microphysical parameters can be retrieved from the microwave imager using certain inversion technology. The microwave imager onboard Fengyun-3B (FY-3B MWRI), the microwave imager onboard Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM TMI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) onboard AQUA are selected to do this research. Experiments of initialization of the cloud microphysical information in Global and Regional Assimilation and Prediction System (GRAPES) during typhoon MA-ON activity are carried out to investigate their impact on forecasts. The results indicate that prediction of hydrometer parameters and surface rain rate can be faster through initialization of cloud information derived from satellite microwave observations in GRAPES model and there is positive contribution during the first 6 hours of the model integration.

Among many examples, highlight industrial applications related to the industry 4.0 paradigm, which increasingly require more data from manufacturing systems. Those sensor-based applications are in many cases safety-critical, requiring dependability guarantees mainly related with reliability and availability, that should be maintained during the whole network operation. Although several approaches have provided network deployment with dependability guarantees, sometimes the monitored environment or the application configurations can change during the network operation, which can violate the dependability requirements and demand network redeployment in order to keep those guarantees. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm to redeploy WVSN guided by the optimization of the application dependability, considering changes on cameras' orientations. A methodology is defined to support dependability analysis. We compare the results of the proposed algorithm with previous algorithms found in literature.

It is mainly due to its vast applications. Designing an appropriate control protocol that guarantees the desired agreement between the agents is the main purpose of the consensus problem. A linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based approach for the H∞ consensus of leader-follower nonlinear multi-agent system (MAS) is proposed in this paper. In the proposed framework, fuzzy Lyuponov function (FLF) is chosen. Some slack matrices are introduced to decouple the Lyapunov matrices from the systems' one which provide more degrees of freedom to the consensus problem and leads to decrease the conservativeness. As a result, sufficient conditions for consensus problem are presented in terms of LMIs. Finally, In order to evaluate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach, a numerical example for consensus of nonlinear MAS with thirteen followers is solved and simulation results are provided.

671,671,Teddybear: Enabling efficient seamless container migration in user-owned edge platforms,"Fog and cloud computing are becoming increasingly popular as computational offloading platforms. However, many areas throughout the world either do not have a stable enough network connection to effectively use cloud computing, or do not have the required infrastructure or resources to set up fog nodes. Moreover, many application categories such as cognitive assistance and augmented reality applications require single digit latency, which both cloud and fog cannot provide. As such, these areas can benefit tremendously from edge computing. To ensure single digit latency, Edge nodes are typically other co-located devices within single-hop proximity. Having said that, due to user mobility, single edge devices set up at home will not provide the required latency if the user is on the move. Therefore, we introduce Teddybear, a Docker based system that seamlessly and efficiently migrates server containers between edge computing platforms by utilizing both the Internet and the user's mobile device as a carrier for the container.

676,676,Measurement of mechanical properties of GRIN rod lens,"The GRIN rod lenses are favorable optical elements for the image transmission in applications where transverse dimensions of the optical system are limited such as rigid borescopes or endoscopes. Flexible versions of these instruments usually use imaging bundles of optical fibers to assure both the mechanical elasticity and the optical transmission. The image resolution of this solution suffers from being limited by minimum fiber core diameter allowable for imaging and total number of fibers in a given cross-section area. GRIN rod lens allows for a higher image resolution for small diameters. While the optical properties of the GRIN rod lens are well known, there is no information about its allowed mechanical stress. In this paper we present a simple system for load and deformation measurement of a GRIN rod lens aimed to be used for a miniature endoscope for eye surgery operation. The system allows for loading force measurement with a deformation strain gauge cell and deformation measurement with an optical triangulation sensor. The paper presents deformation limits of the tested GRIN rod lens loaded by a three-point bending test. We also evaluated the Young modulus of the GRIN rod lens material from the measured data. Our data shows that tested GRIN lenses can be statically deformed by bending down to minimum radius 105 mm without braking.",60013323,Ceské vysoké ucení technické v Praze,Prague,Czech Republic,['1706'],21.7,-0.08736772486772487,0.3693121693121693,1

While many previous works learn to hallucinate the shape directly from priors, we resort to further improving the shape quality by leveraging cross-view information with a graph convolutional network. Instead of building a direct mapping function from images to 3D shape, our model learns to predict series of deformations to improve a coarse shape iteratively. Inspired by traditional multiple view geometry methods, our network samples nearby area around the initial mesh's vertex locations and reasons an optimal deformation using perceptual feature statistics built from multiple input images. Extensive experiments show that our model produces accurate 3D shape that are not only visually plausible from the input perspectives, but also well aligned to arbitrary viewpoints.

679,679,Web-based three-layer protection mechanism against distributed denial of service,"It is widely recognized that the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks can disrupt web services and lead to large revenue losses. DDoS attacks restrict and block legitimate users accessing web-servers by the exhaustion of victim's resources. Due to system leaks and a hidden security problem used, this attack has the characteristics of natural behavior and it is difficult to block it. Protection of web services is of paramount importance since the Internet is the main technology underlying e-commerce, this is the main purpose of DDoS attacks. The article proposed to isolate and protect the correct traffic from the huge volumes of DDoS traffic when an attack occurs. A new DDoS security mechanism has been developed, which is a three-layer protection mechanism based on web-servers. Combining the characteristics of web server traffic and aiming at TCP/IP reference model, it uses statistical filtering and traffic restriction in the network layer, transport layer and application layer to filter out illegal traffic to ensure normal traffic passage. Most of the illegitimate traffic is filtered by SHCF (Simplified Filtering of Hopes) algorithm at the network level. The rest of the illegal traffic is filtered according to the SYNProxyFirewall algorithm at the transmission level. Traffic restriction is used at the application level while DDoS attacks use a legitimate IP address. Due to the joint protection of the three-layer mechanism, support for the availability of web services can be provided during DDoS attacks. The protection mechanism is implemented and tested inside the Linux kernel. The result shows that a three-layer protection mechanism can effectively protect against DDoS attacks.",60111827,Tashkent University of Information Technologies named after Muhammad al-Khwarizmi,Tashkent,Uzbekistan,"['1712', '1710']",20.153846153846153,0.024573112073112073,0.47961760461760466,1

Even in the Industry 4.0 context, real-world monitoring systems are often simple and based on the use of multiple univariate control charts. Data-driven technologies offer a whole range of tools to perform multivariate data analysis that allow to implement more effective monitoring procedures. However, when dealing with complex data, common data-driven methods cannot be directly used, and a feature extraction phase must be employed. Feature extraction is a particularly critical operation, especially in anomaly detection tasks, and it is generally associated with information loss and low scalability. In this paper we consider the task of Anomaly Detection with two-dimensional, image-like input data, by adopting a Deep Learning-based monitoring procedure, that makes use of convolutional autoencoders.

Simultaneously, the robots learn to efficiently cooperate and find an optimal collective behavior while solving the task. To this end, we develop two different control algorithms based on reinforcement learning. The first approach is based on a centralized agent which coordinates the learning behavior of the whole manufacturing cell. In the second approach, a learning agent is assigned to each robot allowing for more flexibility and reducing the state-action space of the reinforcement learning problem at hand. The approaches are applied to a laboratory testbed using two cooperating industrial robots which should learn to optimize the throughput of the manufacturing cell.

693,693,Reliability and availability enhancements of the 5G connectivity for factory automation,"Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) differentiates the fifth generation mobile network (5G) by allowing it to natively address the needs of mission-critical machine type communication, thereby enabling a wide range of use cases. This work selects industrial automation as a target use case for very strict URLLC requirements. By means of simulation, we study how reliability and availability of the 5G connectivity can be improved using multiple transmission/reception points (TRxPs) in an interference limited scenario. A factory scenario with mobile robots connected via a 5G network with two indoor cells is selected, as mobility is one of the main drivers of the need for wireless connectivity, and is also a major challenge to reliability. The results indicate that differences in design alternatives have a significant impact. It is evident that the best design choices for the TRxPs in a given factory significantly enhance communication service reliability and availability, even when no retransmissions are allowed due to very tight latency requirements. The solution can additionally increase capacity in terms of the number of mobile robots supported in the factory, for a desired level of reliability. We conclude that first, the number of TRxPs that simultaneously transmit to a user (referred to as a cluster) cannot be increased indefinitely, as this could increase interference and worsen signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR). We observe that increasing the number of TRxPs deployed in a cell, while keeping the cluster size small, has a positive effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the positioning of the TRxPs around the factory plays an import role. The best observed design choice is to place many TRxPs around each cell, with only one or two TRxPs transmitting simultaneously to a user. Placing the TRxPs at a large distance from each other increases spatial diversity and the likelihood of improving the received signal, and distancing the TRxPs of one cell from the other cell's TRxPs limits interference.",60103653,Aalto University,Espoo,Finland,"['1706', '1710']",26.083333333333332,0.16327971271153088,0.4536353797717434,1

Self-driving smart cars are vital element for creating smart environments. 5G will boost the connection of various devices inside a smart home that will collect and process signals directly coming from human body. Signals from those devices can be analyzed to determine health related issues. However, the fact of considering health monitoring system inside a self-driving smart car remains a challenge for 5G cellular network as at present most of the healthcare monitoring machines are not capable of supporting 5G. In this research work, we have proposed a healthcare monitoring system to determine the current health conditions of passengers inside a self-driving smart car using facile and small 5G enable devices.

699,699,Fusion of surface ceilometer data and satellite cloud retrievals in 2D mesh interpolating model with clustering,"For accurate cloud ceiling information, a data fusion approach is proposed that utilizes satellite data to extend surface station information to much wider areas. Cloud base height (CBH) retrieved from satellite observations provides for much larger spatial coverage and higher resolution. The direct comparison of GOES-16 CBH with surface station ceiling yields a local bias that has to be corrected for in the initial GOES-16 cloud base information. This sparsely sampled bias correction presents an irregular 2D mesh of control points, which is then interpolated by constructing a continuous smooth field using polyharmonic splines. The influence of remote stations is restricted by grouping the control points into clusters depending on an effective distance. This cluster-based approach allows for constructing separate spline surfaces corresponding to physically different clouds. The obtained continuous bias correction function is then applied to the entire GOES-16 pixel level CBH except for areas far away from surface stations in data sparse regions such as offshore.

Mixed collaborative driving includes both human controlled vehicles and vehicles controlled by AI (Artificial Intelligence) that share the physical road resources (e.g., intersections and roundabouts). Many such driving situations cannot be easily created nor replicated in the real life. Therefore, development and testing of AI systems is often done with simulators.Machine learning environments must maintain a real-time understanding of their traffic situation. Scaling of the machine environment to multiple distributed nodes is required to support larger number of participating vehicles. Our experimental environment consists of the CARLA simulator, custom AI implemented with the TensorFlow framework, and a corner case search subsystem.

Basing on split-step fast-Fourier-transform algorithm, the intensity and location of hot images of a spectrally dispersed sinusoidal phase modulated laser beam is numerically investigated. It is found that, the time-average intensity of hot image firstly decreases monotonically with the modulation depth and eventually reaches a certain minimum, then increases slowly and reaches a saturated value; in addition, with the modulation frequency and the grating dispersion coefficient increasing, the time-average intensity of hot image decreases generally; while the location of hot image always does not change. Finally, the influence of the distance from the obscuration to the nonlinear optical element on the suppression effect of spectral dispersion of sinusoidal phase modulated light on formation of hot images is discussed. The result is helpful to appropriately choose parameters of the spectrally dispersed sinusoidal phase modulated light to minimize the threat of optical damage of hot image and improve the performance of high-power laser system.",60023426,Hengyang Normal University,Hengyang,China,['1706'],34.2,0.16468253968253965,0.714153439153439,1

706,706,Is stackoverflow an effective complement to gaining practical knowledge compared to traditional computer science learning?,"In this paper, a method is proposed to assist computer science lecturers in including StackOverflow content in their teaching practice. StackOverflow is a very popular Q&A website about computer programming accessed by approximately 21 million professional developers and university-level students. The primary purpose reported in this paper is to assess the impact of using the StackOverflow Q&A resource as an add-in supplement to enhance students‟ learning achievements. The study sample consisted of 38 undergraduate students who enrolled in a database module. Students were divided in control and experimental group. Pre-tests and post-tests were conducted with both groups in the chosen subject. A comparison was made between the treatment group, which used StackOverflow Q&A as a tutorial tool, and the control group, which studied the same topic using a traditional learning format (set of printed exercises as well as text book examples). Our results show how both the experimental group and the control group significantly improved their performance in the post-test. While the experimental group improved their performance more than the control group, the gap was not significant. The results enable it to conclude that StackOverflow material was at least as effective as the traditional material.

707,707,Algorithm of three-party combined judgment analysis engine for earthquake early warning system," All rights reserved.Thus far, it has been impossible to predict earthquakes accurately, and the best approach so far provides earthquake early warnings by analyzing earthquake information and disseminating warnings rapidly. Earthquake early warning systems (EEWS) must be able to observe P waves (tremors) that spread at a relatively rapid rate, preemptively warn of the risk of damage from the S waves that will subsequently arrive, and prompt residents to evacuate immediately. South Korea’s current EEWS can issue earthquake warnings within 25 s of observing the first P wave. For earthquakes occurring inside the observation network, the epicenter positional error is aimed at within 5 km and the magnitude error within ±0.5 km. For further development of the EEWS used in South Korea, it is first necessary to construct a more rapid, accurate, and stable system by employing scale formulas that determine the scale of the P wave earthquakes using domestic earthquake data. To this end, P wave observations must be performed within 5 s of the occurrence of the earthquake. Existing EEWSs usually use a one-party combined judgment method to predict earthquakes. A seismograph is installed only at one location within a building, and this can lead to judgment errors. In the future, it will be necessary to minimize judgment errors through the stabilization of the EEWS and to perform multi-faceted studies that allow rapid and accurate earthquake judgments to be made. To resolve these problems, this study proposes a new three-party combined judgment method which can determine whether an earthquake is occurring within a maximum of 5 s after vibrations occur by selecting three major comparison patterns for earthquake detection, reprocessing dual sensors as triple sensors, and making sub-judgments and final judgments.",60068714,Korea Polytechnic University,Siheung,South Korea,"['1710', '1706']",28.4,0.13008449883449885,0.5373543123543123,0

To achieve the fast iteration and higher coverage rate tasks in industry, a novel fast iteration algorithm is proposed in this paper to replace the gradient ascent based algorithms in some exiting works. The key issue of the proposed algorithm is that the control gains are set to be time-varying and non-uniform for the mobile sensors. Moreover, some distributed conditions that only address the overlapped coverage rates of the sensors are proposed to trigger the control gains changing. The time-varying gains together with the distributed triggered conditions guarantee the less iteration steps and higher coverage rate of the sensor network.

Implementing an IEC61499 or IEC61131-3 Function Block that is being accessed via service-oriented protocols is straight forward. The main challenge remains in modeling a Function Block as a service. Adopting service-oriented concepts like Service Oriented Architecture or Microservice Architecture requires tackling challenges like service granularity, (de)composition, etc. For instance, too coarse-grained services could lead to significant drawbacks, while too fine-grained services could increase the system's overall complexity, introducing semantic tight coupling and bringing about communication overhead. Therefore, understanding whether a service (de)composition is adding any value could help us to identify the best service granularity. Finding the best service granularity means knowing how many Function Blocks could be exposed into one service. This could undeniable lead to improvement in resource consumption especially in constraint environments. In this paper we design a cost analysis function for calculating the overhead of service decomposition. This work will help to answer one of the most important aspects of the service-oriented approach, called service granularity in the scope of Function Block as a Service.",60031237,London South Bank University,London,United Kingdom,"['1706', '1710']",19.1,0.3441468253968254,0.48561507936507936,1

Au nanocages (Au-NCs) have attracted much attention recently due to their outstanding saturable absorption properties including broadband absorption, ultrafast optical response (a few picoseconds), and large third-order optical nonlinearity coefficient that caused by local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). We propose and demonstrate a tunable Er3+ doped ZBLAN fiber laser using Au-NCs as a Q-switcher for the first time.

715,715,No-reference video quality assessment based on spatiotemporal slice images and deep convolutional neural networks,"Most learning-based no-reference (NR) video quality assessment (VQA) needs to be trained with a lot of subjective quality scores. However, it is currently difficult to obtain a large volume of subjective scores for videos. Inspired by the success of full-reference VQA methods based on the spatiotemporal slice (STS) images in the extraction of perceptual features and evaluation of video quality, this paper adopts multi-directional video STS images, which are images composed of multi-directional sections of video data, to deal with the lacking of subjective quality scores. By sampling the STS images of video into image patches and adding noise to the quality labels of patches, a successful NR VQA model based on multi-directional STS images and neural network training is proposed. Specifically, first, we select the subjective database that currently contains the largest number of real distortion videos as the test set. Second, we perform multi-directional STS extraction on the videos and sample the local patches from the multi-directional STS to augment the training sample set. Besides, we add some noise to the quality label of the local patches. Third, a reasonable deep neural network is constructed and trained to obtain a local quality prediction model for each patch in the STS image, and then the quality of an entire video is obtained by averaging the model prediction results of multi-directional STS images. Finally, the experiment results indicate that the proposed method tackles the insufficiency of training samples in small subjective VQA dataset and obtains a high correlation with the subjective evaluation.",60018308,Xi'an Jiaotong University,Xi'an,China,['1706'],28.0,0.09601503759398496,0.3935213032581454,1

An attractive option is the utilisation of a passively Q-switched Non-Planar Ring Oscillator (NPRO), which has the potential to offer highly stable single longitudinal mode output due in part to its monolithic construction. This paper describes measurement of the frequency stability of a passively Q-switched NPRO under simulated aircraft vibration, which was achieved using a custom designed Fabry-Perot etalon to interrogate the optical frequency of every laser pulse. With no vibration, the long term drift was found to be approximately 4MHz/min. With the drift removed, the laser frequency jitter demonstrated a standard deviation of better than 200kHz over 15 minutes, which was the measurement system noise limit.

728,728,Joint-designed achromatic diffractive optics for full-spectrum computational imaging,"Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) are promising lens candidates in computational imaging because they can drastically reduce the size and weight of image systems. The inherent strong dispersion hinders the direct use of DOEs in full spectrum imaging, causing an unacceptable loss of color fidelity. State-of-the-art methods of designing diffractive achromats either rely on hand-crafted point spread functions (PSFs) as the intermediate metric, or frame a differential end-to-end design pipeline that interprets a 2D lens with limited pixels and only a few wavelengths. In this work, we investigate the joint optimization of achromatic DOE and image processing using a full differentiable optimization model that maps the actual source image to the reconstructed one. This model includes wavelength-dependent propagation block, sensor sampling block, and imaging processing block. We jointly optimize the physical height of DOEs and the parameters of image processing block to minimize the errors over a hyperspectral image dataset. We simplify the rotational symmetric DOE to 1D profle to reduce the computational complexity of 2D propagation. The joint optimization is implemented using auto differentiation of Tensor ow to compute parameter gradients.

729,729,Data augmentation for cnn-based 3d action recognition on small-scale datasets,"Video-based human action recognition recently plays a vital role in many industrial applications thanks to the popularity of depth sensors. A large number of conventional approaches, which have combined handcrafted features and traditional classifiers, cannot deal with various challenges in the field such as the complexity of human actions in the realistic environment. In order to improve recognition performance by exploiting more high-level discriminative features, an efficient skeleton-based action recognition method using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is studied with an image encoder to transform skeleton coordinate data to image-formed data. Since deep learning techniques are fundamentally designed for efficiently working with large datasets, the network overfitting usually occurs if training CNNs on small-scale datasets. To address this issue, a novel data augmentation technique is proposed for both the informative enrichment and overfitting prevention, wherein a skeleton sequence is depicted by manifold action images based on randomly adding some skeleton frames during the data transformation and preparation for the training set. Experimental results on several small-scale challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of action recognition accuracy.",60019209,Kumoh National Institute of Technology,"Kyongsangbuk-do,",South Korea,"['1706', '1710']",30.333333333333332,0.0800952380952381,0.34790476190476194,1

Precast technology is not new to the industry, but its use in the local context is still limited for many reasons. The purpose of this paper is to study the construction techniques and compare the performances of the Individual Panel System (IPS) & Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) precast system through a case study that has been adopted in a high rise public building project in Singapore. From the drawings, specifications, method statements and site documents, it was observed that all the precast components except House Hold Shelter (HHS) were fabricated and installed as an IPS system. Only HHS was used as a PPVC system. The research result indicates that IPS is less productive than PPVC system. Therefore, it could be recommended to introduce PPVC system for the upcoming project that will reduce construction time, cost, waste, site safety hazard, noise, and dust.

In such a case, the robot controller must necessarily be safety-aware. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to evaluate a robot program and compute a safety score for each action that the robot is about to perform. To this end, we have implemented a code analyzer that examines the robot's Move instructions and assigns a safety score. A subjective logic based approach is used to compute the safety score for each instruction. We have evaluated the approach through ABB's RobotStudio® simulator. We simulate two scenarios: First, where two robots share a workspace and second, where a robot moves along a path with an obstacle. The simulations show that using our code analyzer and safety score formalism; it is possible to evaluate the application code for safety and enable avoidance of potentially unsafe behavior.",60076028,ABB Corporate Research India,Bengaluru,India,"['1706', '1710']",20.5,0.0425,0.5458333333333334,1

A result is the possibility to manually classify data arriving at a high rates to train machine learning models. To circumvent the problem of not having a real ground truth we propose specific metrics for model selection and validation of the results.The use case is taken from the food packaging industry, where processes are affected by regular but short breakdowns causing interruptions in the production process. Fast production rates make it hard for machine operators to identify the source and thus the cause of the breakdown. Self learning assistance systems can help them finding the root cause of the problem and assist the machine operator in applying lasting solutions. These learning systems need to be trained to identify reoccurring problems using data analytics.

735,735,A study of action recognition using pose data toward distributed processing over edge and cloud,"With the development of cameras and sensors, and the spread of cloud computing, life logs can be acquired and stored in general households for various services using the logs. However, it is difficult to analyze moving images acquired by a home sensor in real time using machine learning because the data size and the computational complexity are large. New computing paradigm called edge computing or fog computing, which enables distributed computing over edge and cloud, has the possibility to address this issue. The feature vectors are extracted from moving images by preprocessing on the sensor side and the only small feature vectors are sent to the cloud and used for learning. But, it is not clear how accurately we can recognize actions using only the feature vectors in the learning and inferring. We investigate the accuracies of action recognition with various machine learning methods using feature vector information obtained from moving images. We use the pose estimation library OpenPose for detection of the feature vectors and recognize actions using logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and neural network (NN) models, general NN and LSTM, as machine learning methods. The experimental results show that it is possible to recognize an action with 80% accuracy or higher when using random forest and neural network models.

736,736,Severe visibility marine fog detection using GOCI/COMS VIS bands,"In this study, we investigated different optical properties between severe versus moderate visibility marine fog using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) visible band measurements. Severe and moderate visibility marine fogs are best distinguishable with the criteria of visibility as 500 m. Using this, we developed an algorithm that classifies severe visibility marine fog based on Decision Tree (DT) method. Calibration and validation data were constructed for 2016 and 2017 marine fog cases, respectively, through match-up between satellite and in-situ data. In general, marine fog region has differences of textural and optical properties with cloud. The GOCI 412 nm Rayleigh Corrected Reflectance (Rrc) reveals small spatial variability in fog than in cloud. Also, it is notable that some distinction exists in Rrc magnitude between severe and moderate visibility marine fog region. Using this feature, we have developed a satellite marine fog detection algorithm with severe/moderate visibility classification. Rrc and Normalized Local Standard Deviation (NLSD) of Rrc were determined as primary input. However, visible channel alone cannot completely distinguish marine fog from cloud because it does not provide cloud height information. Here, we used cloud top height data from Himawari-8 as a supplementary data to remove cloud that was miss-classified as fog. Hit Rate (HR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR) for moderate (severe) visibility marine fog were 0.96 (0.86) and 0.31 (0.12), respectively.",60068705,Korea Institute Of Ocean Science &amp; Technology,"Sangnok-gu, Ansan-si",South Korea,['1706'],18.416666666666668,0.11000000000000003,0.44499999999999995,1

738,738,A framework for scheduling in cloud manufacturing with deep reinforcement learning,"Cloud manufacturing is a novel service-oriented networked manufacturing paradigm that aims to provide on-demand manufacturing cloud services to consumers. Scheduling is a critical means for achieving that aim. Currently, research on scheduling in cloud manufacturing is still in its infancy, and current frequently adopted meta-heuristic algorithm-based approaches have some shortcomings, e.g. they require complex design processes and lack adaptability to dynamic environments. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that combines advantages of reinforcement learning and deep learning provides an efficient, adaptive and intelligent approach for solving scheduling problems in cloud manufacturing. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no application of DRL to scheduling in cloud manufacturing. This work conducts a preliminary exploration over this issue. First, a DRL-based framework for scheduling in cloud manufacturing is proposed. Then a DRL model for online single-task scheduling in cloud manufacturing is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.

739,739,Time-critical state transfer during operation of distributed embedded applications,"One of the key challenges in dynamic reconfiguration of time-critical distributed embedded applications is state transfer: For consistency, the old component is usually blocked and its state is first extracted, then potentially transmitted and transformed and finally injected to the new component, before it can take over. However, as the technical process needs to be controlled continuously, there is technically no time for blocking. We present an approach to reconfigure stateful distributed embedded applications during operation either without or at least with bounded quality degradation. Using an extended prototype of our real-time container architecture the state transfer can be performed temporally deterministic and coordinated across nodes. By means of the reconfiguration plan the plant operator can employ strategies to keep up the system functionality for a limited time frame while specific components and messages are blocked. We describe a case study with three different reconfigurations showing the applicability of the proposed approach to various scenarios.

740,740,A hybrid approach for prolonging lifetime of wireless sensor networks using genetic algorithm and online clustering,"Currently, the technology advancements have led to significant growth in the application of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and its remarkable developments. WSNs are the most applicable and least-cost sub-category of existing computer networks. However, WSNs still suffer from energy limitation challenges. Since the energy limitation challenges are not appropriately resolved, prolonging the lifetime of nodes by reducing energy consumption has obtained more attention in this literature. In this paper, while routing is being performed an online clustering approach has been developed for updating the sensors' clustering, if it is required. The proposed clustering is carried out based on three objectives including reducing the distance between nodes within a cluster, reducing the distance between the cluster head (CH) candidate nodes and the sink node, and online appropriate energy distribution of the nodes in each cluster for each routing round. The improved fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is applied to perform clustering. Additionally, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used as the routing algorithm. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed FCM-GA algorithm, the DirectTransmission, SH-MEER, and MH-FEER algorithms are compared with FCM-GA.

744,744,Power shepherd: Application performance aware power shifting,"Constantly growing power consumption of data centers is a major concern from environmental and economical reasons. Current approaches to reduce negative consequences of high power consumption focus on limiting the peak power consumption. During high workload periods, power consumption of highly utilized servers is throttled to stay within the power budget. However, the peak power reduction affects performance of hosted applications and thus leads to Quality of Service violations. In this paper, we introduce Power Shepherd, a hierarchical system for application performance aware power shifting. Power Shepherd reduces the data center operational costs by redistributing the available power among applications hosted in the cluster. This is achieved by, assigning server power budgets by the cluster controller, enforcing these power budgets using Running Average Power Limit (RAPL), and prioritizing applications within each server by adjusting the CPU scheduling configuration. We implement a prototype of the proposed solution and evaluate it in a real testbed equipped with power meters and using representative cloud applications. Our experiments show that Power Shepherd has potential to manage a cluster consisting of thousands of servers and limit the increase of operational costs by a significant amount when the cluster power budget is limited and the system is overutilized. Finally, we identify some outstanding challenges regarding model sensitivity and the fact that this approach in its current from is not beneficial to be used in all situations, e.g., when the system is underutilized.",60031040,Umeå Universitet,Umea,Sweden,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",23.6,0.1024248120300752,0.5208521303258147,1

Their broad geographical distribution force them to split physical resources in large numbers of relatively weak machines. The limited available disk space per fog node however creates problems for Docker-based systems which locally cache a copy of every container image they execute: first, caches may fill very quickly, whereas standard Docker never automatically evicts any image from its cache. This motivates us to implement automatic cache replacement in Docker. Second, splitting cache space in multiple disjoint partitions negatively impacts the hit rates. This motivates us to propose allowing multiple co-located Docker servers to share their caches. Our trace-based evaluations show that the proposed design achieves significant cache hit improvements, leading to reductions of average container deployment times between 37% and 78% depending on the scenarios.",60030553,Universite de Rennes 1,Rennes,France,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",19.857142857142858,0.05241815476190476,0.2943824404761905,1

However, data recovery in erasure codes includes high disk I/O, network traffic and complex decoding that impacts degraded read latency, in case of failures. Data access latency is one of the most important metrics to determine Quality of Service. Reducing degraded latency in erasure coding is vital to improve user performance. To reduce degraded read latency of erasure codes, in this paper, we have proposed a cache based technique called ProactiveCache. This proactively copies objects in failure predicted machine into a cache tier. To deploy ProactiveCache, cloud storage system should employ various failure prediction methods to predict hardware failures. On accurate failure predictions, ProactiveCache eliminates degraded read latency. For evaluation, ProactiveCache is implemented on Ceph object storage.

Several kinds of defects arise during their manufacture. As far as very precise aspherical surfaces are concerned, mid-spatial frequencies are probably the most important issue. This type of imperfection fills the gap between shape (low-spatial frequencies) and microroughness (high-spatial frequencies). A smaller part of these defects arise during polishing; however, more of them are generated during the grinding process. Due to the interference of different controlling frequencies in the machine and imperfections in the constructional solution of the grinding machine, defects occur on the optical surface, which deform it. The periods of these defects usually lie in an interval of 0.5 to 10 mm, depending on the parameters of the machining process. To prevent the generation of these structures, a comprehensive measurement of the sources and transmission of vibrations was realised using the measuring device VibXpert II. The measurement was made on the grinding machine Optotech MCG 100 CNC.

Microservice architecture (MSA) is gaining adoption among industry practitioners due to its advantages compared to the monolithic architecture. Although MSA builds on the core concepts of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), it pushes for a finer granularity, with stricter boundaries. Due to cost rationale, numerous companies choose to migrate from the monolithic style instead of developing from scratch. Recently, semi-automatic decomposition tools assist the migration process, yet a crucial part is still missing: validation. The current study focuses on providing a validation framework for microservices decomposed from monolithic applications and complete the puzzle of architectural migrations.

752,752,Ultra-precise surface machining of N-BK7 using microwave-driven reactive plasma jet machining,"Chemically reactive Plasma Jet Machining (PJM) is a contactless and efficient surface machining technique increasingly applied to the surface shape generation and error correction of various optical elements. However, the application of fluorine-based PJM to surface machining of N-BK7® is challenging since the chemical interaction between reactive plasma species and metal components of N-BK7 induces a residual layer in the contact zone and surrounding of the plasma-treated area. It was noticed that a residual layer degrades the ability of obtaining the prerequisite surface profile and causes a nonlinear and hardly predictable removal behavior with respect to the etching time. In this paper, extensive studies are conducted for relaxing constraints in applying the fluorine-based PJM to the surface machining of N-BK7, particularly regarding to the manufacture of freeform optical elements.

753,753,Understanding data correlations in continuous casting systems for autonomous fixed weight cutting,"Continuous casting is the process whereby molten metal is solidified and cut into fixed weight billets. The key requirement is to cut the billets into fixed weight, so that the subsequent rolling steps can roll the billets into high quality fixed diameter, fixed length mills while avoiding wasting or insufficiency of the metal materials. To accomplish this goal, existing casting systems exploit camera systems to measure the cutting length and to control the flame cutter to cut the hot billet, which is called Length-based Cutting using Weight Feedback control (LCWF) approach. However, LCWF approach still provide unsatisfactory cutting performances in production, because the billet weight depends not only on the cutting length, but also on the billet temperature, density, cutting errors, and the billet dragging speed etc. To further improve the cutting weight accuracy, a data driven approach is necessary to investigate how the various features in the continuous casting system impact the cutting errors. In this paper, data mining on real datasets collected from Tangshan Iron company is conducted. We mine data features and data correlations with the cutting errors. Suggestions on how to improve the cutting accuracy using online learning approach are also provided.",60014966,Peking University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.5,-0.19954545454545453,0.6654545454545456,1
754,754,A resource design framework to realize intent-based cloud management,"More businesses and organizations are choosing clouds to accommodate their workload, e.g., annalistic departments of enterprises use public/private cloud to deploy the analysis function of data, and telecommunication operators deploy Virtual Network Functions (NFVs) such as virtual Evolved Packet Core (vEPC) on clouds to provide telecommunication services. When utilizing the cloud, the cloud user is concerned about the functionality, reliability, performance, etc. of the cloud-based function, which we call the intent or the service requirements. However, to meet the intent, the user needs to tell the cloud resource orchestrator/controller what kinds of Virtual Machines (VMs) are needed and the amount of computing resources necessary to allocate to each VM, which we call resource requirements. In our preliminary work [1], we addressed this problem and proposed an Intent-Based Cloud Management (IBCM) framework to 'translate' the cloud user's service requirements into resource requirements. In this work, we have focused on realizing a Resource Design Framework (RDF) for IBCM that decides the needed computing resource amount to fulfill the cloud user' intent/ service requirements. The main contributions of this work are as follows: (1) We have systematically analyzed factors that need to be taken into consideration when designing the resources. (2) On the basis of the analysis, we propose the architecture of RDF that is applicable for various cloud-based applications and scenarios. To the best of knowledge, this is the first work to address this issue. (3) We have validated the proposed RDF in an experimental cloud-based machine learning scenario. The experiment results show our RDF is able to infer the performance and operation state with over 90% precision, thus enabling resources to be precisely designed in accordance with performance requirements and operation policy. (4) In addition to precise resource design, we also proposed a service level agreement (SLA) violation prevention mechanism for RDF and verified its effectiveness.",60025555,Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,Tokyo,Japan,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",25.416666666666668,0.21388888888888888,0.5909722222222222,1

The improved Pulse-Coupled Oscillators (PCO) scheme presented in this paper guarantees the synchronisation on non-identical and time-varying clocks. Meanwhile, it differs from classical PCO by scheduling the transmission of Syncs (i.e., the Pulses of clock) at different time slots. This collision-free pulse coupling scheme makes the concept of PCO applicable to wireless sensor networks, as it is practically impossible in realistic wireless networks for multiple oscillators to transmit Pulses at the same time. Furthermore, a proportional controller is adopted to correct the clock, and convergence and stability of the proposed algorithm are theoretically analysed, proved and evaluated by hardware experiments. The experimental results show that the improved PCO scheme can achieve synchronisation with the precision of around 400 μs on internal oscillator clocks of about 350, 000 ppm.",60004636,University of Northumbria,Newcastle,United Kingdom,"['1706', '1710']",27.666666666666668,-0.02307692307692308,0.31657509157509156,1

760,760,Supply chain management in prefabricated construction: An overview of a developed conceptual framework," All rights reserved.Prefabricated construction (PC) have attracted increasing research attention worldwide due to their advantages such as high construction efficiency, short construction period, low labor cost and low energy consumption. Supply chain management is closely related to the application efficiency of PC, but only in the last three years has this interdisciplinary research received due attention. The global research network in the field of prefabricated construction supply chain management (PCSCM) have not been systematically reviewed so far. Especially in the recent three years, there has been an explosive growth of relevant literature. In this paper, the method of combining scientometrics analysis and thematic discussion was adopted to systematically review 152 important literatures from 2001 to 2018, aiming to provide a holistic understanding of the status in quo, trends and gaps of PCSCM research, and further analyze the prominent problems. The study constructed four kinds of visualized bibliographic information maps for the publication distribution across journals, co-occurrence of keywords, co-authorship analysis, and citation of articles. Then, the four themes summarized by clustering were discussed, mainly focusing on strategic research and project evaluation, PC supply chain process design and optimization, supply chain integration and management, and application of advanced technology.

In this paper, we proposed a reference-less compact imaging physical model, where the 3D light field data embedded in the volumetric speckle stack through a strong diffuser is explored and analyzed. By utilizing wave-optics and a coherent round-trip field estimation method, the scattering matrix of the diffuser is precisely calibrated as a priori knowledge. After then, the multi-slice targets are placed between the light source and the diffuser, and a set of defocused intensity pattern are recorded for recovering the scattered object field. The real object field is extracted from inverse diffracting of the field employing the conjugation of the calibrated scattering matrix.

762,762,A data-centric approach to distributed tracing,"Modern applications are often implemented as distributed systems consisting of multiple application layers and spread across many machines. Monitoring and diagnosing are fundamental challenges of such systems, and many solutions have been proposed. They all aim to abstract the distributed nature and offer a concise overview of the system. Distributed logging, monitoring and tracing solutions help with root cause analysis or assessing the performance of the system. In data processing situations, data is the main driver and it should be treated accordingly. Microservices are often used to implement highly distributed data processing systems, so troubleshooting from a data point of view is also difficult. Data should be monitored and traced across machines and applications in order to get reliable insights into how the data is stored and processed. However, existing approaches to distributed tracing are based on tracing requests that are propagated throughout the system instead on their content. In this work we take a data-centric perspective to tracing and data processing to investigate how content can be traced in a distributed system. We evaluate existing tracing approaches to see if they can be extended to the content itself, then we take into consideration new ones. We implement three different approaches to data-centric distributed tracing in a highly distributed data processing system built using microservices and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.",60002483,Universiteit van Amsterdam,Amsterdam,Netherlands,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",20.09090909090909,0.11858585858585859,0.4889898989898989,1

766,766,Metaheuristic-based workload selection for hybrid cloud rendering of CAD models,"Efficient rendering of massive industrial-plant CAD models is a long-time challenge even when using high-end computers. This problem has been aggravated with the popularization of web-based applications and lightweight devices (e.g., tablets and smartphones) in engineering daily basis activities. One promising solution consists in pushing rendering tasks to the cloud. However, the existing cloud rendering platforms are not able to render CAD models efficiently. In this work, we aim to fill the gap between industrial-plant models and cloud rendering by proposing a hybrid cloud rendering method. In our approach, we define two sets of objects: one for rendering on client-side, and the other for rendering on server-side. The client produces the final image combining local and remote images. As a consequence, our cloud rendering system provides better image quality and more robustness to network fluctuations. A key component of such a solution is the choice of objects to be rendered on the client. We propose a metaheuristic-based method to select such objects. Our solution privileges larger objects with a uniform spatial distribution. This way, the user can still coherently navigate even when the server is not responding.

In this study, we qualitatively and quantitatively compare the cloud amount products from FY-3D and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) AQUA in July and October,2018. The results show that the global spatial distribution characteristics of the FY-3D cloud amount products is consistent with that of MODIS. The distributions of the cloud amount of the two products are more similar in October, but theFY-3D cloud amount data are generally higher than the MODIS cloud amount data. After strict space-time matching, the matched samples are used for quantitative accuracy evaluation. In July 2018, the absolute error of the FY-3D cloud amount relative to MODIS is 4.5, the relative error is 0.11, the deviation is 1.68, the error standard deviation is 12.11, and the correlation coefficient reaches 84.8%.

768,768,Optical tuning of terahertz plasmonic resonances in graphene-based heterostructures,"Graphene has been proposed as an advanced plasmonic material spanning from infrared to terahertz (THz) bandwidth due to its advantages, such as electrical tunability, high carrier mobility, and low energy loss, etc. Therefore, plasmonic devices based on graphene have great potential in active tuning of the plasmon resonances through electrical doping. However, a major drawback of the electrically tuning is that the metal electrodes used in this scheme may increase the complexity of device fabrication and decrease the effective area for wave-graphene interaction. Optically tuning is an alternative to resolve this problem. Here we present a theoretical study on the THz responses and plasmonic properties of graphene-based heterostructures (GBHSs) in the presence of visible irradiation. More concretely, by combining classical electromagnetic theory with the dynamic graphene conductivity under optical pumping, we establish analytical models to describe the THz basic/plasmonic responses of GBHSs including graphene/substrate, cavity with graphene, and graphene/dielectric/dimple-array systems. Meanwhile, the effects of the power of the modulation/pumping light on the plasmonic resonances are also illustrated.

Although the trigger time stamp can be obtained electrically on the circuit board level, it is crucial to detect the actual transmitting laser pulse signal to monitor the malfunction of the laser. To detect the signal, inserting a reflector in the optical path is suggested so that the photodiode can detect the signal directly. To insert the reflector and pulse detection photodiode in the optical path of the transmitting laser, it is required to confirm the obscuration ratio of the laser module by the shadow of the reflector. The shape of the reflector was set to be rectangular due to the manufacturability although the elliptical reflector shows a better performance in the aspect of the vignette. As a result, it is confirmed that the obscuration is tolerable enough to cover the requirement of 0.8 of the nominal irradiances of the signal of each pixel when the reflector angle is set to be 47 ° and insertion depth is between 0.9 mm and 2 mm.",60107890,Hanwha Systems,Seoul,South Korea,['1706'],30.166666666666668,0.10616666666666666,0.5555,1

The aim of Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) is to detect the occurrence of a fall and to automatically and promptly request the necessary assistance. This work proposes a FDS based on wearable sensors - i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes - and Machine Learning (ML), for sensor signal processing and detection. The process extracts a number of features on portions of the signal and classifies them as falls or regular daily activities. The classifier is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that is trained using a manually labelled dataset, where human activities are distinguished between falls and regular activities. The method is assessed on the publicly available SisFall dataset, with extended annotation, and compared with the results obtained in the literature for the same dataset; the proposed method largely outperforms the original analysis technique proposed for the SisFall dataset, with an F1 score higher than 97% and a recall higher than 99.7%.",60026851,University of Oxford,Oxford,United Kingdom,"['1706', '1710']",28.0,0.12410714285714286,0.41311813186813184,1

By uncovering parameters that affect the casting part quality, a continuous process improvement could be enabled. In particular, a focus is laid on the explicability of the identified dependencies due to the acceptance of data-driven decisions by workers as well as to initiate tailored improvement measures. For this purpose, in this paper two visual analytics approaches are discussed for uncovering quality-affecting parameters with the claim for a high degree of explicability - on the one hand a method-feature-heatmap that visualizes a multiple backward feature elimination and on the other hand a graph-based visualization of class association rules.

783,783,Kullback-leibler divergence constructed health indicator for data-driven predictive maintenance of multi-sensor systems,"The unexpected failure of modern industrial systems is often managed using data-driven predictive maintenance (PdM) tools that continuously monitor a system's health condition (HC) through raw sensor data to predict impending malfunction. However, research demonstrates that data-driven PdM tools perform poorly when applied to raw multi-sensor data, as it is not guaranteed that all sensor data describe a system's health condition. As systems become more complex and require multi-sensor measurements, to perform accurate data-driven PdM, an accurate health condition representation of a system's life cycle data is required. This work introduces a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) based health indicator (HI) constructor for multi-sensor systems. This method applies information entropy to construct a HI representation that describes the occurrence of faults and their influences during a system's life cycle. Additionally, the proposed method conducts feature selection to expose and remove sensors that do not capture information related to a system's HC.

784,784,A deep transfer learning approach for seizure detection using RGB features of epileptic electroencephalogram signals,"This paper demonstrates an approach based on Deep Transfer Learning for the classification for Seizure and Non-seizure Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Recognizing seizure signals in intelligent way is quite important in clinical diagnosis of Epileptic seizure. Various traditional and deep machine learning techniques are employed for this purpose. However, the Epileptic seizure prediction and classification performance is not satisfactory over small EEG dataset using traditional approaches. The Transfer learning approach overcomes this by reusing the pre-trained networks such as googlenet, resnet101 and vgg19 trained on large Image database. This experiment has been done in two phases: (1) RGB image dataset generated for the seizure and non-seizure EEG signals data of University of Bonn using a novel preprocessing technique, (2) we configured googlenet, resnet101 and vgg19 trained networks to learn a new pattern or features from the RGB image Dataset and finally, above mentioned networks have been used for the classification. The use of Vgg19 network shows greater accuracy among the three but takes comparatively more prediction time. We will mainly emphasize on the results obtained from the googlenet, since it provides effective accuracy taking less time for prediction. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of above 99% for a smaller number of epochs and maximum accuracy of 100% when we increase number of epochs. Experimental outcomes show the proposed approach using googlent achieved better performance w.r.t to many state-of-the-art classification algorithms even on the small EEG dataset.

A breakdown of HDD may cause horrible data loss and great economic loss. Therefore, failure prediction for HDDs is significant to avoid loss and make a data backup plan in advance. Existing prediction methods always focus on a fixed threshold to distinguish whether a HDD is healthy or not, and these methods neglect the problem of multi-stage degradation phenomenon of HDDs. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a dynamic tracking method for HDD failure prediction based on a switchable state stochastic process model. By utilizing Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, the model estimates and parameters are updated by newly available data. To improve model ability, a sensitive health indicator is constructed from SMART attributes based on multiple regression analysis. Then, based on the statistical property of the tracking residuals, the dynamic failure threshold is designed to realize the online prediction of HDD failure.

788,788,Recursive models of randomized processes in foreign intelligence tasks. Part 1. Simplified lower order models,"For the state, foreign intelligence has always been a sphere of special attention. The role of foreign intelligence has grown significantly in our time when new forms of interstate conflicts appeared (network and hybrid wars, large-scale terrorist acts, systemic interference in the internal affairs of another state, etc.) and the space for their conduct became more complicated (for traditional maritime, land and airspace added a new sphere, cyberspace). Due to this, the conditions for obtaining intelligence and requirements for their processing have become more complicated. Of most interest is the context of intelligence operations, i.e. study of the potential possibilities of data processing models for financial transactions, the movement of human, material, information and other resources from the standpoint of the theory of random processes. However, the classical theory of random processes was developed for tasks when observations of an object were made at regular time intervals (for example, yield, fertility, etc.). Equidistance was implied by default. However, for reconnaissance tasks, such representation of the observed object is unacceptable, since information about it, being random, arrives at random time. We call such processes randomized, emphasizing the very randomization of the moments of receipt of intelligence. There is another important circumstance, the high dynamics of data obsolescence and the limitedness of their volume. Naturally, in this case, recurrence models are necessary that take into account both the lack of information and its «obsolescence» in the context of randomized observations. All these points are taken into account in the proposed models based on modified splines. The models presented in this work are investigated for the cases, when the moments of the appearance of the data are known exactly, or we cannot know these moments for one reason or another. Corresponding algorithms for distinguishing trends of the observed data are constructed, as well as the analyzed statistical properties of their parameters. The results of simulation are presented.

794,794,Learning predictive autoscaling policies for cloud-hosted microservices using trace-driven modeling,"Autoscaling methods are important to ensure response time guarantees for cloud-hosted microservices. Most of the existing state-of-the-art autoscaling methods use rule-based reactive policies with static thresholds defined either on monitored resource consumption metrics such as CPU and memory utilization or application-level metrics such as the response time. However, it is challenging to determine the most appropriate threshold values to minimize resource consumption and performance violations. Whereas, predictive autoscaling methods can help to address these challenges. These methods require considerable time to collect sufficient performance traces representing different resource provisioning possibilities for a target infrastructure to train a useful predictive autoscaling model. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a system that models the response time of microservices through stress testing and then uses a trace-driven simulation to learn a predictive autoscaling model for satisfying response time requirements automatically. The proposed solution reduces the need for collecting performance traces to learn a predictive autoscaling model. Our experimental evaluation on AWS cloud using a microservice under realistic dynamic workloads validates the proposed solution. The validation results show excellent performance to satisfy the response time requirement with only 4.5% extra cost for using the proposed autoscaling method compared to the reactive autoscaling method.",60072749,Qatar University,Doha,Qatar,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",22.444444444444443,0.28148148148148144,0.5805555555555555,1

An integrated architecture means that components are integrated on a computing node, which formerly were allocated to separate computing nodes. Therefore, the execution environment needs to support communication between these components on a computing node. Based on an integrated architecture, a virtual switch supporting time-space isolation and dynamic configuration has been proposed in previous work to address the mixed criticality of TCMS applications and dynamic coupling of vehicles. However, controlled information import and export between different data flows is not addressed in the state of the art.In this paper, we propose a virtual gateway residing in the TCMS execution environment to resolve property mismatches between different data flows and prevent fault propagation between applications of different safety critical levels.

With these dissimilarities in mind, developers can exploit the combined execution of equivalent services to increase accuracy, shorten latency, or reduce cost. However, it remains unknown how to effectively combine equivalent services to satisfy application requirements. With the recent surge in popularity of machine learning, different vendors offer a plethora of equivalent services, whose characteristics are mostly undocumented. As a result, developers cannot make an informed decision about which service to select from a set of equivalent services. To address this problem, we explore different service combination strategies (i.e., majority voting, weighted-majority voting, stacking, and custom) to ascertain their impact on non-functional characteristics. In particular, we study how these strategies impact the accuracy, cost, and latency of the face detection task and validate our findings on the sentiment analysis task. We consider the combined executions of commercial web services, deployed in the cloud, and open-source implementations, deployed as edge services. Our evaluation reveals that the combined execution of equivalent services is most effective for improving cost and latency.

Whitelisting cyber attack detection, that detects anomalous activity as deviation from normal network communication, is especially attracting attention as one of the countermeasures because the traffic patterns are predictable in CPS. However, attackers can execute illegal operations within the normal network communication defined as the whitelisting detection rules because such operations tend to cause unstable control depending on operational states. In this work, we propose a new whitelisting cyber attack detection method that estimates the operational state of CPS and monitors the CPS network with the whitelisting detection rules according to the estimated state. The proposed method can define the more limited normal network communication to generate the whitelisting detection rules in each operational state.

As a control object, a tracked mobile robot chosen because, among other ground vehicles, it is the most maneuverable and designed to work in conditions of limited space. To take into account the nonlinear characteristics of the control object, the article deals with the analysis of a mathematical model of a mobile robotic platform. Also, provides an overview of modern methods and approaches to the control of tracked robotic platform. The problems of controlling the mobile robot are highlighted, in particular, the application of methods and approaches based on the application of system linearization methods, which makes a robotic system with these control laws limited to certain local control algorithms. Therefore, the paper presents an explanation of the use of new non-linear approaches to the mobile robots control, in particular, synergetic control theory. The main method, within the framework of this theory, is the method of analytical design of aggregated regulators (ADAR), which allows to synthesize control laws for complex nonlinear systems of large dimensionality without using linearization procedures or other simplifications, so this method is used to synthesize the synergetic control law of a mobile robot. The resulting control laws takes into account the nonlinear properties of the mobile robotic platform model; therefore, this control strategy ensures the asymptotic stability of the close-loop system and the precise execution of the specified invariants.

In this paper, a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs neural network (NARXNN) architecture is designed to estimate the SOC. The proposed method requires no model or knowledge of battery's internal parameters, but rather uses the battery's voltage, charge/discharge currents in various ambient temperature to accurately estimate battery's SOC. An unscented Kalman filter is used to reduce the errors in the neural network-based SOC estimation. The adaptability, efficiency, and robustness of the model are evaluated using the FUDS, US06 and DST driving cycles at varying temperatures conditions. The results prove that the proposed NARXNN-UKF model achieves higher accuracy with less computational time under different temperature conditions and electric vehicle driving cycles.",60013614,Hangzhou Dianzi University,Hangzhou,China,"['1706', '1710']",19.375,0.12833333333333335,0.45,1

However current systems present main limitations in terms of low information rates, short propagation distances and low compatibility with today classical optical infrastructure. These restrictions bound the development of this field and its practical applications. High-dimensional quantum communication can help in overcoming these challenges enhancing the information rate and the system error tolerance. We here report our recent results on high-dimensional fiber based quantum communication, both with multicore and multimode fibers, in which we prove the capability of preparing, manipulating, transmitting and measuring advanced quantum states with excellent fidelities.

811,811,A deep neural network based approach to energy efficiency analysis for cloud data center,"The energy consumption growth of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector contributes to almost 2% of the global carbon footprint with an estimated trend of 3-3.6% by 2020. Most of this growth (45%) can be attributed to data centers (DC) which now represent the core infrastructure for different industries. Furthermore, cloud DCs are complex systems composed of several ICT and non-ICT (i.e. mechanical and electrical) sub-systems. The variety of configurations and the inter-dependencies of the different DC sub-systems leads to enormous challenges in understanding and optimizing DC energy efficiency based on the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metric. Within this context, we focus in this work on analyzing the behavior of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based model to predict the DC energy efficiency metric (PUE). In fact, the proposed model is used to evaluate the impact of various DC sub-systems on energy efficiency. Through an experimentation with real datasets from a real DC, we observed that DNN-based model achieves a good Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

812,812,A hybrid POW-POS implementation against 51 percent attack in cryptocurrency system,"The success and popularity of Bitcoin mainly focuses the underlying blockchain technology which is totally immutable distributed ledger, highly secured by its P2P network consensus named Proof of Work (PoW). One of the worst threats to a Proof-of-Work based cryptocurrency is 51% attack. If one or more dishonest network peer gains more than 50% of resource such as processing power, then they will become the majority decision maker in the network. It is already proved that mixing of two or more existing protocol that is called hybrid protocol can make the network enough resistive to this attack. The recent implementations of hybrid protocols have other limitations and problems that they are facing and striving to resolve. But their main weakness is in distribution of block mining reward to the investors. From the perspective of an investor, an investor invests his hard-earned money in a cryptocurrency for making proper profit from his investment. The main source of this profit is the block reward which is generated and given to the miner on successful mining of a block. So, to ensure this profit is given to proper user on proper time interval, the consistency of block generation time interval is a vital factor. The voting system, ticket system etc. are not time controlled and over all block reward generation interval will not show a uniform distribution of profit. Another big issue is diversifying the peers by creating special committee and groups of validators the concept of P2P network is violated. In this paper we will describe a step by step process to implement a Hybrid PoW-PoS based consensus protocol. In our proposed system, the PoW mining process is only used to regulate the block generation time. The actual block generation is done by the same user with PoS consensus mechanism. There is no voting or validating committee. The entire network will validate each block. This is the major difference with other discussed system. The system will not only be able to tackle the 51% attack, it provides a uniform distribution of mining reward to the stake holders and investors by maintaining a precise block generation interval with difficulty adjustment in PoW mining and probability calculation for stake holders according to their matured staking balance. We will not only show how to make the system non-vulnerable to this attack but also describe in detail about how to validate the transactions and blocks in different stage of creating the block chain.",60028599,University of Memphis,Memphis,United States,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",20.35,0.09332251082251082,0.4844372294372294,1
813,813,"Threshold wind speed and turbulence under LLJs events at Ipero, Brazil","The threshold wind speed is a useful criterion in determining whether strong turbulence is generated within the Stable Boundary Layer (SBL), the layer where all surface emissions remain confined during the night. Confidence turbulence estimates are extremely important for atmospheric transport and dispersion simulations, although due to its complex dinamics many aspects of the SBL are neglected by numerical models that, in turn, are the inputs and boundary conditions for the transport and dispersion simulations. Turbulence is especially important during severe episodies like hazardous material accidental releases, for example. Turbulence intensity can affect the dispersion speed, released material concentration, and its reach. For many decades, remote sensing has been an important tool in filling the gap of information and providing advances in the atmospheric sciences. The doppler lidar is increasingly being used for micrometeoroly and Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) studies because of its autonomy and long range capability, in contrast with traditional techniques as radioprobes and captive balloons. After 1 year of continuous measurements with a doppler lidar, it was possible to determine the threshold wind speed for Ipero, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Besides threshold wind speed, it was observed that the SBL turbulence has a straight relationship with the Low-Level Jets (LLJs) that frequently occur over the region. The vertical turbulence distribution depends greatly on the LLJ characteristics, which in turn is highly variable during its life cycle. The strong turbulence regime is associated to the stronger LLJs, that presents a more defined pattern. In contrast, weak LLJs (that generate weaker SBL turbulence) present more dispersive characteristics in respect to the entire dataset. These differences are seen both for the LLJ height as for the turbulence vertical profile. These results will contribute for the atmospheric modeling and dispersion simulations, as well for the environmental studies at Ipero.",60011039,"Instituto de Pesquisas Energeticas e Nucleares, Sao Paulo",Sao Paulo,Brazil,['1706'],22.846153846153847,0.20988095238095242,0.5118452380952381,1

However, data obtained from batch processes are characterized by its high dimensionality that exceeds the computational capabilities of online applications and data-driven model's reliability must be guaranteed for proper industrial implementation. We explore two approaches to reduce problem's size: feature extraction and feature selection; several multivariate regression methods are also compared regarding it precision and robustness. We base our analysis on an industrial rubber compounding process where natural rubber is blended in a semi-batch mixer with several additives, then it is further mixed up using cylinders and it is conditioned in bands for storing. For this process, real production data is collected and stored in the manufacturing execution system of the company. The objective of the analysis is to predict mechanical properties of the rubber at the end of the processes. Based on the provided data, several data-driven models are built and tested.

To be able to analyze which factors (or combinations of factors and at what level) are significant, the experiment has to be replicated. For economic or practical reasons, it may not be feasible to perform the experiment more than once therefore unreplicated factorial designs are often employed. This is especially true in the field of Medicine, Pharmacy and Industrial production units. The traditional method of analysis of variance (ANOVA) cannot be employed in unreplicated factorial designs, therefore many methods have been proposed in literature. In this paper, a new method of analyzing unreplicated factorial designs is proposed and was compared with some of the existing methods. The four existing methods considered were: Lenth, Berk and Picard, Juan and Pena, and Dong. The comparison was performed using Monte Carlo simulation method. The criteria used in evaluating the performances of the methods are Power and Individual Error Rate (IER). Using these criteria of evaluation, the results showed that on overall performance, Dong method is the best among the four existing methods considered and was closely followed by Berk and Picard, Lenth, then Juan and Pena methods in that order.

In small systems, an information model can be created manually with reasonable effort. In systems with numerous data structures, however, the effort for manual creation is too demanding. In order to continue using the existing data structures in the code without having to handle OPC UA-specific data structures, a transformation between the existing data structures and the OPC UA information model is necessary. This article presents a possibility of generating an OPC UA information model by a description of the existing data structures, e.g. generated based on ROS messages. The description of data structures is evaluated at runtime and linked with the existing data structures. The different representations for the different access types (read, request/response) in the OPC UA information model are discussed. In addition, an OPC UA client can read the information model from the descriptions of the data structures and write the read data back to the original data structure. In this way, both the provision of the data via OPC UA and the reception are possible.

819,819,Investigation of shortwave edge in high-power supercontinuum with different peak power,"The peak power of pump pulse is a key factor in the generation of supercontinuum source. Observably, as the peak power of the pump pulse increases, the spectral range of the supercontinuum becomes wider. In order to study the blue shift limit of PCF fiber at different peak powers, in our experiment, the change in peak power is achieved by introducing a different length of chirped fiber after the oscillator to vary the pulse width. The pump source is a self-made laser with pulse duration, operating wavelength and repetition rate of 12 ps, 1064 nm and 68 MHz, respectively, which are injected into the photonic crystal fiber after three stages of amplification. Finally, a supercontinuum with an average power of 358 W in the spectral range of 466 nm to 2400 nm was achieved. Experiments have shown that the introduction of large positive chirp has a significant effect on the supercontinuum of the 10 W class, but for a supercontinuum with a sufficiently high average power (over 100 W level supercontinuum spectrum). after the peak power threshold is exceeded, further blue shift of the spectrum cannot be achieved by increasing the peak power, but the high peak power helps to improve the spectral flatness of the supercontinuum. The four-wave mixing, dispersive wave generation, radiation trapping with the soliton play much important role in the blue-shift of SC spectrum, but the short-wave edge is limited by the group velocity matching condition, which is determined by the dispersion characteristics of the PCF, not only peak power of the pump pulse. In order to further extend the short-wave spectrum, other methods are required, for example, changing the structural characteristic of the PCF, etc.",60069721,China Academy of Engineering Physics,Chengdu,China,['1706'],31.11111111111111,0.04635539064110493,0.5339785611214183,1

It combines hyperspectral field measurements and airborne image analysis and puts forward a modified version of differential optical absorption spectroscopic technique, termed as a-DOAS that defines the absorption depths through weighted average of radiance at absorbing and non-absorbing wavebands. Field spectroradiometry was carried out for part of two adjacent cities, namely Howrah and Kolkata, over sites of varied population density and vehicle abundance at both narrow and wide angle field-of-view. The local concentrations of atmospheric CO2 at the ground surface and the solar illumination at the measuring spot were noted simultaneously. As an alternative to the general validation method of comparing the image-derived absorption depth with that simulated with radiative transfer model, the present work is based on the image-derived and the ground-based data. The relative differences of the surface reflectance for the pixels of different features were reduced by normalizing the pixel values with suitable constants. While calculating the CO2 absorption depths, a correction for the adjacent water vapor absorption band was made with MODTRAN simulation. Since the pixel-to-pixel variation of radiance was too fine, the CO2 map was generated by computing average through convolution and filtering with kernel of 11×11 pixels.

It's meaningful to investigate the temporal shaping technology of broadband low-coherence light. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme of achieving all-optical arbitrary temporal shaping of broadband low-coherence light based on saturable absorption effect. Compared to traditional temporal shaping schemes such as electro-optic modulation(EOM) shaping or acousto-optic modulation(AOM) shaping, the modulation on the shaped pulse profile is much smaller, reduced from 14% (by acousto-optic modulator) to 3%(close to the ASE noise). Furthermore, we explore the evolution of shaped pulse contrast (intensity ratio between front edge and end edge) with the pump energy and contrast changing. The contrast of shaped pulse can be adjusted from 1:1.32 to 1:1.02 when pump contrast is 1:2, and from 1:2.25 to 1:1.90 when pump contrast is 1:3. And the maximum contrast of shaped pulse can reach 1:17 within the measurement accuracy. By changing the energy and contrast of pump, the contrast of the shaped pulse can be controlled flexibly.

In these systems, the average wavefront slope from a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor is widely employed as the feedback of beam stabilization. However, when the adaptive optics system is applied to improve the beam quality of a high-power solid-state slab laser, the ""M"" shaped aberration at the edge of the slab and the fluctuating intensity distribution of the beam would induce some errors when using the average slope to measure the direction of the beam. In this paper, we present the numerical analysis of beam direction detection errors in solid-state slab laser beam clean-up systems using the average slop. At first, we calculated the direction detection errors with the aberations composed of the first 64 Legendre polynomials using the average slope. Then we measured the wavefront of a solid-state slab laser with a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, and evaluated the influence of the ""M"" shaped aberration and fluctuating intensity distributions both in the time and frequency domains.

828,828,Variation in climate change as a result of reductions in short-lived climate pollutants,"Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) are agents that have a short lifetime in the atmosphere, cause a warming effect on climate, and impact human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. SLCPs include black carbon (BC), methane (CH4), and tropospheric ozone (O3). BC is produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, and it is the primary component of particulate matter. Sulfate and nitrate aerosols are the major anthropogenic particulate matters and they have a cooling effect on the climate. This study focused on several SLCPs, including BC, sulfate aerosols, and nitrate aerosols. This study included SLCPs that warm and cool the climate as well as compared changes in the near-future with respect to climate due to SLCPs emissions via various pathways. The focus of this study was climate change in Asia. To estimate the effects of SLCPs on climate, an earth system model MIROC-ESM was used. Multiple experiments using MIROC-ESM were performed for the years 2010-2049, considering various greenhouse gases and SLCPs emission pathways. Results reveals that SLCP emissions can be decreased by controlling air pollution. Moreover, improvements in energy efficiency to achieve a low-carbon outcome can also greatly reduce SLCPs, especially in rapidly developing countries of Asia.

829,829,ParaOpt: Automated application parameterization and optimization for the cloud,"The variety of instance types available on cloud platforms offers enormous flexibility to match the requirements of applications with available resources. However, selecting the most suitable instance type and configuring an application to optimally execute on that instance type can be complicated and time-consuming. For example, application parallelism flags must match available cores and problem sizes must be tuned to match available memory. As the search space of application configurations can be enormous, we propose an automated approach, called ParaOpt, to automatically explore and tune application configurations on arbitrary cloud instances. ParaOpt supports arbitrary applications, enables use of custom optimization methods, and can be configured with different optimization targets such as runtime and cost. We evaluate ParaOpt by optimizing genomics, molecular dynamics, and machine learning applications with four types of optimizers. We show with as few as 15 parameterized executions of an application, representing between 1.2%-26.7% of the search space, that ParaOpt is able to identify the optimal configuration in 32.7% of experiments and a near-optimal configuration in 83.2% of cases. As a result of using near-optimal configurations, ParaOpt reduces overall execution time by up to 85.8% when compared with using the default configuration.",60106362,Cancer Science Institute of Singapore,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1703', '1705', '1712']",24.25,0.13823529411764704,0.5102941176470589,1

The skills of human workers, however, are difficult to program and seem currently unmatched by technical systems. In this work we present a data-driven approach to extract and learn robot-independent contact skills from human demonstrations in simulation environments, using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. Our model learns to generate error-correcting sequences of forces and torques in task space from object-relative motion, which industrial robots carry out through a Cartesian force control scheme on the real setup. This scheme uses forward dynamics computation of a virtually conditioned twin of the manipulator to solve the inverse kinematics problem. We evaluate our methods with an assembly experiment, in which our algorithm handles part tilting and jamming in order to succeed. The results show that the skill is robust towards localization uncertainty in task space and across different joint configurations of the robot. With our approach, non-experts can easily program force-sensitive assembly tasks in a robot-independent way.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.75,-0.0012820512820512818,0.4102564102564102,1
831,831,Data quality control with multi-source information for FY-3 microwave sounder observations,"Launched in 2013, and 2017 respectively, Chinese Fengyun-3C and 3D meteorological satellites are equipped with two microwave sounders, Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS) and Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2), whose observations play an important role in numerical weather prediction by data assimilation. Data quality control should be carried out before assimilation to filter out bad data, such as cloud-or rain-polluted data and questionable data. This work can't be accomplished purely depending on MWTS or MWHS-2 themselves. MWHS-2 is taken as an example to do quality control in the paper, and the method is suitable for MWTS too. Multi-source information from other instruments onboard FY-3 is extracted to assist in the work. Cloud mask product from VIRR (Visible and InfraRed Radiometer), oceanic cloud liquid water content product from MWRI (Microwave Radiation Imager), and global rain rate product from MWRI are mapped to MWHS-2 for quality control in combination with oceanic rain detection product from MWHS-2 itself. 6 kinds of cloud and rain detection schemes are then designed to get the best choice by analyzing the characteristics of background departure. RTTOV v10 is adopted to simulate brightness temperature of MWHS-2 at all channels. The results suggested that scheme RI RC (MWRI cloud and rain information ingested) and scheme RC (all information ingested) are the two best choices for numerical assimilation application, and scheme RI RC can retain more samples. Questionable data can also be found in the way to help monitor the operational status of instruments.",60073482,National Satellite Meteorological Center Beijing,Beijing,China,['1706'],24.2,0.14566326530612247,0.5279761904761904,1

With a better information preservation in detail, edge and texture of the image, nonlocal information is jointly considered with H-MTV model as NL-H-MTV model. Additionally, the two fast algorithms, namely dual bregman iteration and split bregman iteration, are respectively used for solving the H-MTV and the NL-H-MTV model, leading to a fast and accurate convergence.

For this small samples situation, a new method of individual recognition of wireless network devices based on transfer learning is proposed. We combine a convenient signal processing method with transfer learning in this paper. The acquired signal is divided into source domain and target domain. We extract the feature of transient signal and get the weight of feature. Then we transfer the knowledge of the source domain to the target domain. The training model is reconstructed by adjusting the weight of the source domain samples, which solves the problem of insufficient training samples in the small samples situation. The results show that in the case where the number of target domain samples is less than 30, the recognition rate has improved obviously. It enriches the application of transfer learning in the field of individual recognition.",60010421,Southwest Jiaotong University,Chengdu,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",19.77777777777778,-0.08230027548209366,0.39056473829201105,1

However, with the rapidly expanding search space of these complex and large applications on cloud, the evaluation phase takes inordinate amount of time, rendering Bayesian optimization ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian optimization based framework, called, Adaptive Cloud Application Optimization Framework (ACAOF) to efficiently and optimally tune the performance of cloud workloads via significantly pruning the search space. We conducted extensive evaluations on ACAOF to compare with non-optimized Bayesian optimization on multiple categories of cloud workloads. The results demonstrate that the ACAOF outperforms approximately by up to 218%.

The early detection of anomalies can avoid critical process breakdowns and hence can increase the overall productivity of the system. The availability of labelled datasets for all the possible faulty scenarios is generally not possible, as most of the industrial systems operate in a non-faulty condition. Deep learning architectures that can be trained in an unsupervised setting such as deep autoencoders, denoising autoencoder and variational autoencoder provide an appropriate solution to this problem of unlabelled data for industrial anomaly detection. We investigate and compare the applicability of these architectures on the benchmark Tennessee Eastman fault detection study.

However, because the above three datasets have the characteristics of balanced data categories and simple identification tasks which can't be ignored for classification problems, the SSL algorithm has uncertainties of effectiveness in the case of unbalanced datasets and specific recognition tasks. We analyze the datasets and find that the number of ""disgust"" in expressions dataset is less than other categories, and so is ""discussion"" in the classroom action recognition dataset.

In particular, the precipitation modifies the atmospheric column thermodynamics through the process of evaporation and serves as a proxy for latent heat modulation. For this reason, a correct precipitation parameterization (especially low-intensity precipitation) at global scale, bedsides improving our understanding of the hydrological cycle, it is crucial to reduce the associated uncertainty of the global climate models to correctly forecast future scenarios, i.e. to apply fast mitigation strategies. In this study we developed an algorithm to automatically detect precipitation from lidar measurements obtained by the National and Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) Micropulse lidar network (MPLNET) permanent observational site in Goddard. The algorithm, once full operational, will deliver in Near Real Time (latency 1.5h) a new rain mask product that will be publicly available on MPLNET website as part of the new Version 3 Level 1.5 data. The methodology, based on an image processing technique, can detect only light precipitation events (defined by intensity and duration) as the morphological filters used through the detection process are applied on the lidar volume depolarization ratio range corrected composite images, i.e. heavy rain events are unusable as the lidar signal is completely extinguished after few meters in the precipitation or no signal detected because of the water accumulated on the receiver optics. Results from the algorithm, besides filling a gap in precipitation and virga detection by radars, are of particular interest for the scientific community because will help to better understand long-term aerosol-cloud interactions and aerosol atmospheric removal (scavenging effect) by rain as multi-year database being available for several MPLNET permanent observational sites across the globe.

To determine the PSF, traditional methods treat a fluorescent bead as a point source whose optical field distribution is approximate to it. However, beads with sufficiently small sizes are often difficult to observe in a microscope due to their low brightness. In this paper, we present a new approach to measure the PSF under the condition of non-ideal point sources and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We first recorded a focal stack of fluorescent beads and automatically selected those that met certain requirements. Then, we computed a two-dimensional (2D) PSF for each plane at different defocus distances, some of which were fitted according to Gaussian distribution and the rest were calculated mainly by averaging the beads. Finally, we combined each 2D PSF based on the energy distribution to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) PSF. The proposed algorithm has been tested on the Real-time, Ultra-large-Scale imaging at High-resolution (RUSH) macroscope. By implementing deconvolution using the PSF derived by this method and a traditional method respectively, results show that the proposed algorithm has achieved a more accurate measurement of the PSF.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,['1706'],22.22222222222222,0.014615800865800868,0.5050487012987012,1
847,847,Power-based restoration of haptic teleoperation from communication blackout,"Recently, network-based control systems attract a lot of attentions. One of the applications of such control systems is haptic transmission using a bilateral control system. In order to construct the bilateral control system over the time delayed-network, many researchers have proposed many methods and succeeded to improve the stability and performance of the system. By assuring the system's passivity, some of conventional methods have succeeded to stabilize the system even when the communication blackout occurs. However, the passivity-based methods are conservative and deteriorate the performance. In this paper, the mode shifting method is proposed to deal with the communication blackout without considering the system's passivity. In the proposed method, the bilateral controller is shifted to a local controller when the communication blackout occurs. By shifting to the local controller, the system is not destabilized by the blackout. Moreover, when the communication recovers, the bilateral controller is gradually restored to regulate the robot's output power. Owing to the power regulation, the robots never damage environmental objects during and after the communication blackout. Therefore, the proposed method realizes stable and safe control even under the blackout.

They cause atmospheric pollution which influence negatively on human health and affect the radiation balance of the atmosphere, resulting in climate change. Aerosol distribution in the Earth's atmosphere is studied using measurements from many satellite and ground-based instruments. One of the valuable sources of atmospheric aerosol data is measurements by a ground-based network of sun and sky radiometers AERONET. The AERONET retrieval algorithm provides aerosol volume concentration. However, AERONET observations are sparse in space and time. To obtain information on aerosol volume concentrations with complete spatial and temporal coverage, model simulations can be applied. However, the agreement between model results and measurements is not good enough. To obtain the most likely true estimate on aerosol volume concentration, the optimal interpolation method is used in the present work. This approach is much less computationally expensive than other data assimilation methods. The method of optimal interpolation is based on the minimization of the mean-square error in the estimate. In the present work, the technique is used that combines observational data, statistical mean values, and results of the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem simulation. Implementation of the optimal interpolation method makes it possible to estimate the values of the aerosol volume concentration when measurements are absent.

852,852,A hierarchical storage system for industrial time-series data,"The increasing interest among manufacturers in monitoring and analyzing industrial systems is generating a problem related to the considerable costs associated with the storage of captured data. This paper presents a three-level hierarchical architecture for time-series data storage on cloud environments that helps to decrease those costs. In the first level, new raw time-series data is stored for a short-period of time (e.g., one day) on electronic non-volatile storage such as solid-state drives (SSDs) that provide fast access for real time visualization of the latest data. In the second level, recent time series are stored for a medium-period of time (e.g., one week) on magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs) that are lower-cost devices with slower data transfer speed. In the third level, a reduced representation of the time series obtained by applying time-series reduction techniques are stored in HDDs, for a longer period of time (e.g., one year).

855,855,Nonlinear system identification using a recurrent network in a bayesian framework,"Modern deep neural networks are being widely exploited to solve challenging learning tasks, including nonlinear system identification. Bayesian system identification intrinsically encapsulate uncertainty in model parameters and provides forecasting distribution enabling enhanced analysis, simulation and control system design. Nevertheless, the application of the full Bayesian approach to articulated models as deep neural networks results quite challenging in practice. In this work we propose an identification technique for nonlinear dynamic systems exploiting a deep recurrent neural network with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) units retaining a Bayesian framework. To such an aim, we stacked the recurrent neural network with a probabilistic layer, decomposing the nonlinear dynamic model into a combination of flexible functions. Hence, deterministic and stochastic layers are trained jointly, forcing the learning algorithm to transform the input data sequences into a deterministic feature space encoded by the LSTM, useful for predictions. Besides, we deployed a scalable technique based on Variational Inference to deal with the exact inference intractability. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by the application to a widely exploited open benchmark for nonlinear system identification.",60023256,Politecnico di Milano,Milan,Italy,"['1706', '1710']",22.375,0.12666666666666665,0.42888888888888904,1
856,856,Generation of elemental image array based on photon mapping,"The current algorithms of generating element image array using ray-tracing are complex. Although the quality of images generated by ray tracing is high, it requires a lot of double counting. Therefore, we propose to utilize photon mapping algorithm for generating element image array to reduce a lot of calculations in this paper. First, for a given virtual model, a light source is set, the photon emission vector is calculated and photons are tracked. A global photon map is used to store the energy and incident direction of the photons. Then, we trace rays of light that start from the viewpoint and pass through each pixel into the scene, and record the surface material of the first collision point into the photon map. The image of one view point can be generated according to the estimated rays of light by photon map. The photon map need to be generated only once for all images of different viewpoints. Finally, the images of different viewpoints are converted into an element image array. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the generation speed of element image array significantly in the complex scene, especially for the generation of multiple images. While in the simple scene, the proposed method might be slightly slower for generating one image, but it still shows its advantages in the case of generating multiple images.",60007711,Jilin University,Changchun,China,['1706'],20.454545454545453,0.07128787878787879,0.47752164502164507,1

869,869,Evaluating two semantics for falsification using an autonomous driving example,"We consider the falsification of temporal logic properties as a method to test complex systems, such as autonomous systems. Since these systems are often safety-critical, it is important to assess whether they fulfill given specifications or not. An adaptive cruise controller for an autonomous car is considered where the closed-loop model has unknown parameters and an important problem is to find parameter combinations for which given specification are broken. We assume that the closed-loop system can be simulated with the known given parameters, no other information is available to the testing framework. The specification, such as, the ability to avoid collisions, is expressed using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In general, systems consist of a large number of parameters, and it is not possible or feasible to explicitly enumerate all combinations of the parameters. Thus, an optimization-based approach is used to guide the search for parameters that might falsify the specification. However, a key challenge is how to select the objective function such that the falsification of the specification, if it can be falsified, can be falsified using as few simulations as possible. For falsification using optimization it is required to have a measure representing the distance to the falsification of the specification. The way the measure is defined results in different objective functions used during optimization. Different measures have been proposed in the literature and in this paper the properties of the Max Semantics (MAX) and the Mean Alternative Robustness Value (MARV) semantics are discussed. After evaluating these two semantics on an adaptive cruise control example, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses to better understand the properties of the two semantics.",60000990,Chalmers University of Technology,Göteborg,Sweden,"['1706', '1710']",22.583333333333332,0.06309523809523811,0.5704613095238095,1

The system can recognize human actions successfully when the camera of a robot is moving toward the target person from various directions. Therefore, the proposed method is useful for the vision system of indoor mobile robots. The system uses three types of information to recognize human actions, namely, information from color videos, optical flow videos, and depth videos. First, Kinect 2.0 captures color videos and depth videos simultaneously using its RGB camera and depth sensor. Second, the histogram of oriented gradient features is extracted from the color videos, and a support vector machine is used to detect the human region. Based on the detected human region, the frames of the color video are cropped and the corresponding frames of the optical flow video are obtained using the Farnebäck method (https://docs.opencv=.org/3.4/d4/dee/tutorial-optical-flow.html). The number of frames of these videos is then unified using a frame sampling technique. Subsequently, these three types of videos are input into three modified 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) separately. The modified 3D CNNs can extract the spatiotemporal features of human actions and recognize them. Finally, these recognition results are integrated to output the final recognition result of human actions. The proposed system can recognize 13 types of human actions, namely, drink (sit), drink (stand), eat (sit), eat (stand), read, sit down, stand up, use a computer, walk (horizontal), walk (straight), play with a phone/tablet, walk away from each other, and walk toward each other.

TDC(Timing discriminator) measures the timing difference with specific threshold voltage level called LED (Leading edge discriminator) method. The timing difference varies since the timing at the threshold voltage is different depending on the intensity of the returned signal. This timing error is called walk error. To compensate the walk error, CFD(Constant fraction discriminator) and ZCD(Zero crossing discriminator) methods are used. These methods utilize the peak point. However when the signal is saturated, these methods bring significant error since the peak point can't be found. It is important to prevent the signal to be saturated for high performance of distance accuracy and wide input dynamic range. Walk error compensation methods composed of current sensing circuit and MOSFET will be presented.

They are facing however challenges regarding, autonomy, scalability and efficiency. The pressing question is how to make the IDS capable of extracting the accurate network behavior while being intelligent enough to detect new intrusions. It is therefore, important to explore new possibilities that could lead to a further improvement in that respect. Our research is an inspiration of two fields. Data mining as a field that provide powerful techniques for learning and knowledge extraction and swarm intelligence a field that include collaborative and stigmergic heuristics for search and detection. As we tried to combine these two methodologies for intrusion detection problem, using Particle Swarm Optimization as a detection heuristic we did come up against many nuances that we tried to explain through this paper.

One of the recent topic detection methods is Eigenspace-based Fuzzy C-Means, which is a soft clustering-based topic detection method. In this method, the textual data are transformed into a lower-dimensional Eigenspace using truncated singular value decomposition. Fuzzy C-Means is performed on the Eigenspace to identify the memberships of each textual data to each cluster. Using these memberships, we extract the topics from textual data on the original space. In this paper, we use another approach to extract the topics by transforming back the centroids of the clusters into the positive subspace of the original space.

Among various kinds of SOPs, longterm evolution (LTE) is considered a suitable candidate for a positioning system owing to its high transmission power compared to GNSS signals, high bandwidth, and high data rates. To distinguish LTE signals from each other and to recognize the base transceiver station that transmits each LTE signal, also known as eNodeB, cell identity (cell ID) must be determined. To organize a high-reliability positioning system, the maximum correlation peak value of reference signals and reference signal received quality (RSRQ) can be considered the criteria by which to evaluate the reliability of a determined LTE cell ID.

Stability of the core depends on the strength and control of its muscles. Hemiparesis due to stroke can compromise this control, thus reducing core stability of stroke survivors. Therefore, to allow stroke survivors to safely and independently perform activities of daily living, rehabilitation therapists focus on increasing their core stability. Core rehabilitation involves performing training exercises while sitting on stable or unstable surfaces. This paper presents the development and initial testing of a system that can provide both stable and controlled unstable surfaces for the performance of trunk rehabilitation exercises. It is a 4 DOF system that can gauge the position of the user's center of pressure (COP) using built-in instrumentation and can move according its movements. The system has a graphical interface that is used to provide movement targets to the user which they have to achieve by moving their COP.

In order to handle sparse distributions of points, we further employ radial basis functions (RBF) to compute a local, continuous representation within each voxel. Our approach results in a good volumetric representation that effectively tackles noisy point cloud datasets and is more robust for learning. Moreover, we further introduce group equivariant CNN to 3D, by defining the convolution operator on a symmetry group acting on mathbb{Z}3 and its isomorphic sets.

891,891,Effect of the relative rotation axis position of the stretching machine and ankle,"At the onset of a stroke, paralysis of the lower leg typically causes a foot deformity called the foot drop. Stretching is an effective technique for physical therapy. An automated stretching machine provides the option to incorporate long-term stretching at home. We have remodeled a commercial foot exerciser to function as a stretching machine for ankle dorsiflexion [1]. It is believed that the rotation axis of such machines should be aligned with the biomechanical axis of the human body, which is the design principle our prototype is based on. However, there have been no studies that have investigated the best position of the axis required to achieve effective stretching. In this study, we evaluated several positions of the machine's rotation axis in the sagittal plane with respect to the stretching effect and physical burden (safety). The force applied on the foot and ankle dorsiflexion angle were measured during the stretching experiments. We computed the work involved in ankle dorsiflexion and the force not contributing to the dorsiflexion movement, which served as indicators for the stretching effect and potential physical burden, respectively.

893,893,Exploiting stack-based buffer overflow using modern day techniques," Published by Elsevier B.V.One of the most commonly known vulnerabilities that can affect a binary executable is the stack-based buffer overflow. The buffer overflow occurs when a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations. Nowadays, due to multiple protection mechanisms enforced by the operating system and on the executable level, the buffer overflow has become harder to exploit. Multiple bypassing techniques are often required to be used in order to successfully exploit the vulnerability and control the execution flow of the studied executable. One of the security features designed as protection mechanisms is Data Execution Prevention (DEP) which helps prevent code execution from the stack, heap or memory pool pages by marking all memory locations in a process as non-executable unless the location explicitly contains executable code. Another protection mechanism targeted is the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), which is often used in conjunction with DEP. This security feature randomizes the location where the system executables are loaded into memory. By default, modern day operating systems have these security features implemented. However, on the executable level, they have to be explicitly enabled. Most of the protection mechanisms, like the ones mentioned above, require certain techniques in order to bypass them and many of these techniques are using some form of address memory leakage in order to leverage an exploit. By successfully exploiting a buffer overflow, the adversary can potentially obtain code execution on the affected operating system which runs the vulnerable executable. The level of privilege granted to the adversary is highly depended on the level of privilege that the binary is executed with. As such, an adversary may gain elevated privileges inside the system. Most of the times, this type of vulnerability is used for privilege escalation attacks or for gaining remote code execution on the system.",60107810,Bucharest University of Economic Studies,Bucharest,Romania,['1700'],22.0,0.15522556390977443,0.4466541353383459,0

OptNibors employs an optimization tool to select the best neighbors' list that improves prediction accuracy. Consequently, each individual represents a candidate neighbors list of AU. The proposed method consists of two phases, preprocessing and optimization phases. The preprocessing phase prepares the used seeds for initializing the population in the optimization phase. The executed preprocessing steps differ based on the historical recorded shopping behavior of AU. A set of experiments was conducted to compare OptNibors with alternative methods.

In this paper, we propose a model-free lane keeping system based on long short term memory (LSTM) which considers the time sequential information of data. The dataset was collected by various sensors and reshaped for the training. We can obtain the steering command directly by the end-to-end recurrent network. To validation, the LKS simulation was conducted and we observed that the proposed method is more accurate than the lane keeping by feedback control.",60024872,Hanyang University,Seoul,South Korea,"['1702', '1706']",20.428571428571427,0.0957482993197279,0.4993197278911566,1
908,908,A Portable Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy System Using 4-wavelength LEDs,"Recently many countries are facing the problem of a rapid aging society. Due to the geriatric brain diseases, the research on brain imaging in a normal environment is becoming more important. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has proven its effectiveness in measuring the concentration changes of blood chromophores in the human body. In this study, we develop a light emitting diode (LED) based fNIRS instrument capable of measuring the concentration changes of multiple chromophores. We used 4-wavelength LEDs of 770 nm, 810 nm, 850 nm, and 890 nm for our system for calculating not only the concentrations of hemoglobin, but also the concentrations of oxidizing enzyme which increase or decrease during the oxygen exchange process. Along with calculating more chromophores, this device will provide more accurate oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin values. The LED driver circuit is designed using a serial peripheral interface (SPI) based output expansion chip. Photodiode (PD) is used to measure the intensity of light after absorbing and scattering during passing through the medium. The control system is designed using the microcontroller unit (MCU) and to enable bidirectional communication with the host computer at 4 Hz by using serial communication.

LED light intensity directly correlates to electrical power consumed. Energy consumption is the result of electrical power consumed over a period of time. Three experiments with varying conditions utilizing constant electrical energy consumption were conducted.

Children at primary schools have to face rising cognitive demands that the handwriting represents, and some of them are not able to do so. As a result, they tend to make mistakes and their written product is dysfluent and has poor legibility. HD can also lead them to lower self-esteem, learning difficulties and ultimately to less academic achievements. For this reason occupational therapists are trying to identify HD through examination as early as possible. We extracted online handwriting signals of children using digitizing tablets. Handwriting Proficiency Screening Questionnaire for Children (HPSQ-C) was used to score severity of HD in children's written product. To advance current computerized analysis of online handwriting, we employed fractional order derivative features (FD) together with conventional measures. We selected significant features for HD identification and utilized correlation analysis together with Mann-Whitney U-test to evaluate their discriminative power. We can conclude that FD-based features bring benefits of more robust quantification of in-air movements as opposed to the conventionally used ones.

In particular, this applies to projects that develop solutions for the public sector and test them by means of pilot applications. In these projects, involved stakeholders require meaningful evaluation results to derive lessons learned and to steer future research activities in the right directions. Today, most projects define and apply their own evaluation schemes. This yields evaluation results that are difficult to compare between projects. Sometimes, inconsistent evaluation schemes are even applied within a project. In these cases, even evaluation results of a single project lack comparability. In absence of coherent evaluation schemes, lessons learned from conducted evaluation processes cannot be aggregated to a coherent holistic picture and the overall gain of research projects remains limited. To address this issue, we propose and introduce an evaluation scheme for arbitrary pilot-based research projects targeting the public sector. The proposed scheme follows a hierarchical approach. Concretely, it organizes evaluation criteria on different layers of abstraction. Furthermore, the proposed scheme describes in detail necessary process steps to carry out evaluations using the defined criteria. This way, the proposed scheme enables in-depth evaluations of research projects and their pilot applications. At the same time, it assures that obtained evaluation results remain comparable anytime.

933,933,Development of Polymer Properties Prediction System for Operation of PE Reactor,"Efficient operation of the polyethylene (PE) process is greatly dependent on the correct prediction or estimation of the properties including melt index, density and production rate. However, direct measurement of resin property has limitation due to cost of measuring equipment and long measurement period. Although product drops are made every few minutes to remove resin from a reactor, they vary in size and do not occur at a precisely known frequency. These problems make the difficulty of the real-time control of the product quality and lead to yield off-spec products, resulting in economic losses. For this reason, resin property in polyethylene process must be inferred or calculated from other process variables that are directly measured. The combination of online and offline measurement equipment information based on the process model not only improves the measurement performance of the quality variable but also contributes to the control performance of the product property.

936,936,Upsampling Algorithms for Autoencoder Segmentation Neural Networks: A Comparison Study,This paper compares nine different upsampling methods used in convolutional neural networks in terms of accuracy and processing speed. The process of image segmentation using autoencoder neural networks consists of the image downsampling in the encoder and correspondingly of image upsampling in the decoder part of the network to achieve original image resolution. This paper focuses on the upsampling process in the decoder part of the standard U-Net neural network. Three different interpolations are compared with and without subsequent lxl convolution layers and three transpose convolution layers for image upsampling using different size convolutional cores. The experiment has shown that the best practical results were achieved using simple nearest neighbor interpolation upsampling taking into consideration the computational time needed. The network using nearest neighbor interpolation upsampling achieved pixel accuracy of 99.47% and has shown fast training time and convergence in comparison with other networks using different upsampling methods.

The objective is to minimize the number of handovers in a use-case consisting of a robot equipped with a positioning device, moving along predetermined routes, in two indoor scenarios. The proposed methods predict the next position of the robot. The position is input to functions, constructed by symbolic regression from field measurements, that describe the radio maps for each cell, mapping positions to received powers. The function returning the highest power determines the serving cell. With one of the proposed methods, which implements a neural network, we manage to significantly reduce the number of handovers performed along the routes of the robot. The reduction in handovers allows to save resources, and scale up the use of simultaneous transmissions, which are needed to minimize handover setup times, making possible ultra reliable communications in cellular networks.",60033191,VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland,Espoo,Finland,['1705'],20.857142857142858,0.09375,0.49375,1

943,943,Pedestrian Positon Estimation Using Sensor Fusion Method Considering Gait Phase,"In this paper, we propose a method to mitigate the vulnerability of pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system to drifted position error through sensor fusion method. The heading of various error factors in general PDR system is unobservable, so it is difficult to reduce the error without supplementary information. Although there are many studies to reduce this heading error, a method using building information is generally used. However, since the building information has to be known in advance, the proposed method is a method using only IMU attached to both shoes. The proposed algorithm is based on consensus filtering used in single target tracking. Assuming that the position of the pedestrian is a single target, two estimation results can be obtained through the sensors attached to each shoe. However, since two inertial sensors estimate the position of each shoe, it estimates the position of the moving shoe. In order to assume a single target, we consider the gait phase so that both estimates can estimate the same position. Experimental results show that using the proposed algorithm improves the performance of the PDR system.",60120116,Automation and Systems Research Institute,Seoul,South Korea,"['1702', '1706']",20.22222222222222,-0.017857142857142856,0.4639880952380953,1

We can see only certain constellations in one season because we cannot see the stars during the day. However, we want to see certain constellations throughout the four seasons for entertainment or education purpose. To do this, we need to have the ability to make any constellations in the sky. One way is to use a drone swarm. In order to use the drone swarm as the stars, we extended the equatorial coordinate system on previous research and we flew the drones to the directions of the stars from an observer's points of view using the extended equatorial coordinate system. Furthermore, we calculate the direction of the stars including the additional time in real time and control drones follow these directions of the stars from an observer's points of view.

945,945,New context-based node acceptance cbna framework for mitm detection in SDN architecture," Published by Elsevier B.V.Software Define Networking (SDN) is a paradigm that was developed to cope with the inherent limitations cause by the rigidity and lack of customization of the traditional networking architecture. SDN has my applicational advantages in terms of network management and configuration and has led to a shift in the view of networking as a whole. Despite the benefits, SDN is facing several challenges most of which are concentrated at the level of network management, security and scalability. These challenges have already prompted several researches among academics and industrials worldwide. Even though several solutions have already been proposed and developed, most of the challenges still remain and more research work is still needed in order to address them. We propose in this article, an in-depth study that measures the risks of two attack scenarios, and the possibility of deploying a solution to mitigate intrusions on SDN, as well as the mitigation of the vulnerabilities resulting from the authentication process of new nodes on the network.

946,946,An attention-enhanced recurrent graph convolutional network for skeleton-based action recognition,"Dynamic movements of human skeleton have attracted more and more attention as a robust modality for action recognition. As not all temporal stages and skeleton joints are informative for action recognition, and the irrelevant information often brings noise which can degrade the detection performance, extracting discriminative temporal and spatial features becomes an important task. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end attention-enhanced recurrent graph convolutional network (AR-GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition. An attention-enhanced mechanism is employed in AR-GCN to pay different levels of attention to different temporal stages and spatial joints. This approach overcomes the information loss caused by only using keyframes and key joints. In particular, AR-GCN combines the graph convolutional network (GCN) with the bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN), which retains the irregular joints expressive power of the original GCN, while promoting its sequential modeling ability by introducing a recurrent network.

This has led to a significant increase in generated in mobile network traffic volume, the transmission of which requires not only high network bandwidth but also the ability of operators to provide users services with the required quality of service (QoS) level. In such conditions, there is the problem of frequency spectrum lack, which requires operators and standardization organizations to search for an effective solution. There are two types of these problem solutions: attracting additional resources, for example, using higher frequencies, such as mmWave, or more efficient use of existing ones, for example, through the use of Licensed Shared Access (LSA) or Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) frameworks. We focus on LAA framework that was introduced by the 3GPP consortium as part of LTE Advanced (LTE-A) technology and defined as a system capable of ensuring the coexistence of LTE and Wi-Fi networks in unlicensed bands.

The present study proposes a detection algorithm for small infrared targets based on the spatio-temporal saliency fusion. The contourlet analysis and edge extraction are carried out in the concurrent design. In order to effectively suppress the background and improve the target signal-clutter ratio, the spectral residual method is combined with the abovementioned methods to reconstruct the target fusion saliency image. Then the target motion region is estimated based on the optical flow method for the fusion saliency image and it is matched with the target area of interest to achieve the moving target detection. Moreover, the pipeline filtering is introduced to achieve the target confirmation by multi-frame judgment, reduce false alarm rate and complete the moving target detection for the infrared image sequence.

However, for social systems that thrive on the interaction between and among users, important features are developed based on relationships that evolve over time. Typical learning management systems are designed with the teacher and the student as primary users of the system, my.eskwela is a social learning management system that has been designed for use in public schools in the Philippines with the inclusion of an additional user, the school administrator. Although administrators influence on student learning through mediated effects of instructional leadership, pieces of literature are few that provide evidence of their presence in the learning environment, specifically in the implementation of sLMS. By applying Social Network Analysis in the interaction logs from a sLMS that includes instructional leaders in its implementation, this paper aims to answer the question: Can instructional leadership be manifested in social system interactions? Using measures of centrality in social network analysis, results show that administrators play a key role in the network as main drivers of the network information flow. The results affirm the explicit presence of instructional leadership in the implementation of my.eskwela.

958,958,Comparing SVM and GLM in calculating insurance premium for flight delay,"The development of land transportation in Indonesia does not discourage users to use flight transportation modes. This is due to the shorter travel time and the high safety factor. Sometimes flight delay and cancelation cannot be avoided, which cause the airline's company must give compensation to customers. However, customers feel dissatisfied because compensation is considered inadequate even though it has followed government regulations. Airlines, on the other hand, also feel reluctant to improve their services, one of the possible reasons is the cost of customer compensation is far cheaper than the cost of improving services. The purpose of this study is to propose a premium calculation to overcome this problem to satisfy both parties. If the premium is purchased by users whose price is included in the ticket price, the airline can receive additional funds to improve their services. There are several premium calculation techniques, this paper discusses three calculation models. They are standard deviation, Generalize Linier Model, and Support Vector machine.

961,961,Data-Driven Quadratic Optimization for Tracking Problems with Application to a Tray Indexing System,"Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) algorithm explores the correlation between the cost function and the parameters of the controller. It introduces one data-driven approach to derive the gradient of the cost function with respect to the controller parameters and provides an iterative numerical method for the controller parameters optimization. However, classical IFT algorithms require three experiments to be conducted at one iteration, and one special experiment is included in the three experiments. That means the reference signal is changed during the iteration because of the special experiment, which restricts the application of the IFT algorithm in many areas. Besides, in many process control applications with long duration, IFT algorithm is much more time-consuming than many other tuning algorithms. In this paper, a novel IFT algorithm is proposed. For each iteration, no special experiment is required, which means parameters of the controller can be tuned when the system is running normally.

Defects in operation are principally identified through changes in the neutron ux, as captured by detectors placed at various points inside and outside of the core. While wavelet-based analysis of the measured signals has been thoroughly used for anomaly detection, it has yet to be coupled with deep learning approaches. To this end, this work presents a novel technique for anomaly detection on nuclear reactor signals through the combined use of wavelet-based analysis and convolutional neural networks. In essence, the wavelet transform is applied to the signals and the corresponding scaleograms are produced, which are subsequently used to train a convolutional neural network that detects possible perturbations in the reactor core. The overall methodology is experimentally validated on a set of simulated nuclear reactor signals generated by a well-established relevant tool.

RPM-Net is a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), composed of an encoder-decoder pair with interleaved Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) components, which together predict a temporal sequence of pointwise displacements for the input point cloud. At the same time, the displacements allow the network to learn movable parts, resulting in a motion-based shape segmentation. Recursive applications of RPM-Net on the obtained parts can predict finer-level part motions, resulting in a hierarchical object segmentation. Furthermore, we develop a separate network to estimate part mobilities, e.g., per-part motion parameters, from the segmented motion sequence.

978,978,Bilinear Robust Control Design for Virotherapy Model,"In this paper we concerned with the application bilinear robust control for virotherapy model. In designing the controller, it requires a solution to the state dependent algebraic Riccati equation (SDARE). However, it is difficult to solve the SDARE. Successive method is one of the methods that can be used to solve this issue. The idea of this method is converting the bilinear systems into time-varying linear system. This method has the following step: firstly, we need to obtain the robust control for the linear system by ignoring the multiplicative term of bilinear system. Second, convert the bilinear systems into the time-varying linear systems using the previous result, and then solve the SDARE by the new performance index and the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. Last, iterate the steps until the convergence of state satisfied. The virotherapy model has been widely developed and can be considered as a model in bilinear system. There are four groups in this model: quiescent cells (Q), cancer cells (S), virus (V), and infected cells (I). Virus are injected into the human body as the control input to control the amount of the cancer cells. In this case, virus can only infect the cancer cells, and the infected cells will die when the lysis process occurs. Virus, as a control, is given with the aim of minimizing the energy used in the system. In this model we consider the body's immune response as an additive disturbance to the model. From the simulation results, it is shown that virotherapy can reduce the number of cancer cells in the body on day 50th, so the number of cancer cells in the body is only 16.6%.

990,990,Consistency and Availability in Microservice Architectures,"For the most part, the first instances of microservice architectures have been deployed for the benefit of the so-called Internet-scale companies in contexts where availability is a critical concern. Their success in this context, along with their promise to be more agile than competing solutions in adapting to changing needs, soon attracted the interest of very diverse classes of business domains characterized by different priorities with respect to non-functional requirements. Microservices embraced this challenge, showing a unique ability to allow for a plethora of solutions, enabling developers to reach the trade-off between consistency and availability that better suits their needs. From a design point of view this translates into a vast solution space. While this can be perceived as an opportunity to enjoy greater freedom with respect to other architectural styles it also means that finding the best solution for the problem at hand can be complex and it is easier to incur in errors that can put a whole project at risk.

Furthermore, an analysis of the walking data obtained from traditional walking trolleys revealed that 80% of the subjects walked at a speed of 2.5 km/h or more.

Only the leader robot has the authority to make decisions. It possesses the main controller and is capable of navigating through an unknown environment using the data provided by on-board sensors. In the proposed system, a vision-based feedback method is combined with an explicit control method that oversights the virtual trailer between the leader and the follower. The parameters required to maintain a constant distance between the two robots are computed by the leader and transmitted to the follower directly. A fiducial marker is mounted on the front of the follower robot and is captured by a camera attached to the leader robot. Information exchanging methods based only on impedance control can be expensive because of the need of high-level controllers and force/torque sensors for both robots. Furthermore, the visual response scheme adds robustness to the system by reducing the limitations of sole explicit control methods.

The methodology proposed in this paper aims at a reduced turn-around time for evaluating different design choices of hardware and software components of DNN systems.

Deep learning compilers introduce hardwarespecific transformations and are, therefore, considered a part of the design flow of virtual system models to extract end-to-end performance estimations.

Such incomplete caging is often called as partial caging, and in which the object can escape from the cage of robots. And then the object is prevented from moving by both geometrical constraints and mechanical effects. The former can be discussed with arrangements of robots and environments, and the latter is investigated with static/dynamic analyses of contact forces.

These characteristics generate similar signal patterns for the same fault. However, signals in poor installation maintenance depend on how to install them. This means that a different signal pattern occurs in the same fault state. In this paper, DT-CNN (Decision Tree Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm is proposed to solve the above problems in applying deep learning to motor fault diagnosis. The supervised learning cannot verify outlier data. The proposed algorithm complements this disadvantage by using over fitted CNN in the selection process of the decision tree. In order to verify the performance of this algorithm, normal and gear fault data were collected. The data were collected by varying the motor installation state.

However, despite the many advantages provided by this service in terms of cost reduction and efficiency, DBaaS raises many security issues regarding data privacy. The protection of privacy has been addressed by several research contributions proposing efficient solutions such as encrypted databases and blind queries over encrypted records. However, access control techniques still suffer from a lack of efficiency especially when dealing with encrypted databases. In this latter context, almost all proposed schemes consider an architecture of a single user (the data owner) that queries his encrypted database that he is the only one capable of decrypting. From a practical perspective, a database system is set up to support not only a single user but multiple users initiating multiple queries. However, managing multiple accesses to an encrypted database introduces several challenges like key sharing, key revocation, and data re-encryption. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient proved protocol that allows multiple users to query the same database and decrypt the retrieved results without getting access to the secret key. In this protocol, the data owner is not risking the data privacy since he does not need to share the secret key to enable a multi-party collaboration.",60011066,University Ibn Tofail,Kenitra,Morocco,['1700'],24.555555555555557,-0.00394420394420395,0.46044171877505213,0
1015,1015,Detection of timestamps tampering in ntfs using machine," Published by Elsevier B.V.During a digital investigation, the recorded time of activity on the system is crucial for solving the case. But file times may be subject to user manipulation for deceptive reasons. Detecting such timestamps change, in a none-automatic way, will come to finding a needle in a haystack. Many ways can lead to timestamps manipulation: The presence of anti-forensics tools, unusual timestamp differences in the volume shadow copies, the system restore points and the filesystem metadata, inconsistencies in the filesystem timestamps or with the established rules of normal time behavior, timeline analysis, etc. However, while reviewing the literature, we found little use of the capabilities of machine learning algorithms in such detection. In this paper, a machine learning approach for the automatic detection of timestamps tampering is proposed to reduce the required manual search for such manipulation. Put differently, the approach predicts a classification of input files in whether they have been timestamp tampered or not. Furthermore, the process of a synthetic dataset collection, features engineering and extraction, dataset manipulation, training, and model evaluation is presented.

In addition, the movement of tuna follows the pattern of changes in Earth's temperature, so determining its position clearly requires adequate equipment. The original purpose of Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) is for enforcement and control of vessel sailing. In this paper, we use VMS to find the position of tuna to reduce fishing costs for Indonesia tuna fishermen such as fuel and labor costs. This study does three things. Firstly, conduct tracking modeling of the movements of each type of fishing vessel in Indonesian waters, and use crossreference with weather data and earth conditions, then filtering the data for fishing tuna vessel only. Secondly, develop visualization techniques resulting from algorithms by programming Python Dash.

In a truly Conversation Web, websites and users implicitly “discuss” in the form of clicks, mouse scrolls and movements, as well as page views and product purchases. Websites use this information for decoding user interests and profile and provide customized one-to-one services. In this work we proposed an integrated architecture for the conversational Web; consequently we propose a novel hybrid approach for recommendations using offline and online analysis, as well as we propose a novel personalized search strategy that takes into account the strict time performance limitations applied in e-commerce. We evaluate the proposed methods on three different datasets and we show that our personalized search approach provides considerably improvements in search results while being suitable for near real-time search in commercial environments.

This paper proposes a novel method for batch selection, that involves replacing easy training examples with difficult ones every epoch, which results in an acceleration of the training process of deep networks. The resulting algorithm was tested on four datasets, representing both regression (Boston Housing) and image classication (MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100) problems.

In order to take advantage of CNNs in predictive modeling with audio data, standard FFT-based signal processing methods are often applied to convert the raw audio waveforms into an image-like representations (e.g. spectrograms). Even though conventional images and spectrograms differ in their feature properties, this kind of pre-processing reduces the amount of training data necessary for successful training. In this contribution we investigate how input and target representations interplay with the amount of available training data in a music information retrieval setting. We compare the standard mel-spectrogram inputs with a newly proposed representation, called Mel scattering. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of additional target data representations by using an augmented target loss function which incorporates unused available information.

1028,1028,Edge computing with embedded AI: Thermal image analysis for occupancy estimation in intelligent buildings,"With the rise of the IoT, there has been a growing demand for people counting and occupancy estimation in Intelligent buildings for adapting their heating, ventilation and cooling systems. This can have a significant impact on energy consumption at a global scale as such systems consume about 40% of electricity and create about 36% of the CO2 emissions in Europe. Previous approaches to occupancy estimation either utilize methods that do not ensure people's privacy when obtaining high accuracy estimations, such as RGB cameras, or utilize thermal or radar sensors with lower accuracy. Thermal vision for people detection has several advantages. It protects people's privacy while being less affected by changes in the environment. In addition, most of the previous image processing approaches rely on streaming the data to the cloud to be analyzed. However, with the development of the more distributed network paradigms edge and fog computing, there has been a trend in moving computation towards the edge of the network. This process of embedding intelligence into end-devices enables more efficient energy consumption and network load distribution.

These devices are not only sensors nodes that collect the non-private data, but also are devices that process sensitive information that has higher requirements into security and privacy. Unique and qualified identification and high-secure authentication are essential basics to facilitate these requirements in security and privacy. While security and privacy are widely described and examined for applications used on personal computers, the situation is more demanding for smart-devices. Due to the steadily increasing number and the continuous enhancement of smart-devices, there will be no stable technology over the years.

Currently, many classification methods have been used for defect diagnosis using images inside pipelines. However, most of these classification models train the classifier with the goal of maximizing accuracy without considering the unequal error classification cost in defect diagnosis. In this study, the authors analyze the characteristics of sewer pipeline defect detection and design an automated detection framework based on the cost-sensitive deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The method makes the CNN network cost sensitive by introducing learning theories at the structural and loss levels of the network. To minimize misclassification costs, the authors propose a new auxiliary loss function Cost-Mean Loss, which allows the model to obtain the original parameters of the network to maximize the accuracy and improve the performance of the model by minimizing total misclassification costs in the learning process. Theoretical analysis shows that the new auxiliary loss function can be applied to the classification task to optimize the expected value of misclassification costs. The inspection images collected from multiple drainage pipes were used to train and test the network. Results show that after the cost-sensitive strategy was added, the defect detection rate decreased from 2.1% to 0.45%.

1057,1057,Attack Resilient State Estimation by Sensor Output Coding,"Designing control systems with a level of resilience against malicious attack has become an important problem because a number of attack incidents recently occurred resulted in significant damages. Resilient state estimation refers to a method of correctly estimating plant states in spite of attacks on sensors. The underlying principle for the majority of existing resilient state estimation methods is to take advantage of redundancies in sensing. More specifically, in order to tolerate (i.e., correctly estimate the plant states) attacks on up to q sensors, the plant must satisfy 2q-redundant observability. In this work, we propose a sensor output coding based resilient state estimation that tolerates the same level of attacks but requires the plant to satisfy a relaxed condition of q-redundant observability. The coding based mechanism identifies the attacked sensors and invokes a state estimator that uses only intact sensors. This enables a correct state estimation even if more than half the sensors are corrupted, which is not possible in most existing works.

The process model allows for the representation of a diverse array of algal co-firing scenarios by the characterization the parameters at each step of algal cultivation and processing. As the flue gas composition changes with the introduction of algal biomass fuel, the closed loop iteratively solves the model until the change in flue gas composition falls under a set tolerance. Evaluation of a 1 GW PC power plant with 10% co-firing showed that despite a reduction in specific global warming emissions from 282.9 kg CO2-eq/GJe to 254.0 kg CO2-eq/GJe, LCOE rose from 36.6/GJe to 38.6/GJe resulting in a baseline avoidance cost of 69/ton CO2. Due to the reliance on preliminary experimental data for parametric inputs, uncertainty was propagated with Monte Carlo simulations. The Monte Carlo distribution ranges for sustainability metrics revealed wide ranges with varying degrees of feasibility. Key RD parameters were identified by performing sensitivity analysis.

This applies not only to single-robot cases but also for multi-robot systems. When initial relative poses between robots are unknown, inter-robot loop closures must be found in order to merge their local maps and produce a global map. This becomes an even more challenging issue in the presence of perceptual aliasing that arises from repetitive features and patterns in highly structured settings such as indoor environments.

In the traditional fault diagnosis, most of the past researches focus on the I-V curve to determine the PV arrays state. However, most inverters as smart meters cannot obtain data in high frequency and high volume in order to calculate the I-V curve, and the information usually cannot be retrieved conveniently. In this paper, we evaluate various Recurrent Neural Network Models' from the recent advances in the deep learning field and their abilities in predicting PV arrays power generation. The results show the Encoder-Decoder model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the decoder and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) are more effective in predicting the PV arrays solar output production and can be used as the foundation for fault diagnosis and prediction.",60027709,National Taiwan University of Science and Technology,Taipei,Taiwan,['1705'],28.4,0.1689523809523809,0.49485714285714283,1

To solve the above problem, the discrete clutter determination method based on filtering response loss is proposed. Firstly, the power of the potential target is calculated after clutter suppression, and then the power loss of the potential target is obtained by giving comparison to the initial power. Finally, in accordance with the criterion that power loss of discrete sidelobe clutter is high while that of the moving target is low after clutter suppression, with which the discrete sidelobe clutter can be identified based on the adaptive threshold.

A key challenge towards this goal is how to accommodate diverse shape variations, including both continuous deformations of parts as well as structural or discrete alterations which add to, remove from, or modify the shape constituents and compositional structure. Such object structure can typically be organized into a hierarchy of constituent object parts and relationships, represented as a hierarchy of n-ary graphs. We introduce StructureNet, a hierarchical graph network which (i) can directly encode shapes represented as such n-ary graphs, (ii) can be robustly trained on large and complex shape families, and (iii) be used to generate a great diversity of realistic structured shape geometries. Technically, we accomplish this by drawing inspiration from recent advances in graph neural networks to propose an order-invariant encoding of n-ary graphs, considering jointly both part geometry and inter-part relations during network training. We extensively evaluate the quality of the learned latent spaces for various shape families and show significant advantages over baseline and competing methods. The learned latent spaces enable several structure-aware geometry processing applications, including shape generation and interpolation, shape editing, or shape structure discovery directly from un-annotated images, point clouds, or partial scans.",60022148,UCL,London,United Kingdom,['1704'],32.0,0.10167748917748919,0.4279761904761905,1

In order to compensate for the disturbance of an autonomous driving vehicle, we exploit Deep Neural Network(DNN). It is well-known that we cannot compute the control command that completely compensates for any unmatched disturbance. In vehicle lateral dynamics using a lane keeping system with a look-ahead distance, there always exists the disturbance caused by a curvature of road. Thus, it is inevitable that the lane keeping system only with a feedback control has steady-state error in the lane center on a curved road. To resolve this problem, we utilize the feedback control system with DNN. The proposed method is unique in compensating for the unmatched disturbance in lane keeping system. From a simulation study, we observed that the proposed method could reduce lateral tracking error up to a half on a curved road.",60024872,Hanyang University,Seoul,South Korea,"['1702', '1706']",18.875,0.01203703703703704,0.6407407407407407,1

To this end, we estimated the word error rate (WER) of each system. The results showed that a double-radar-based SSR system produced better WER output.

Thus, tech companies gather huge data and exercise their powers to digitalize the information to capture and utilize the knowledge within their reach. Information management enables firms to improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue, understand customer behavior, mitigate risk assessment, making a multidisciplinary approach. Another approach is to be able to identify business strategies. Information management researches (using machine learning algorithm) can help the field to discover what is significant on a customer behavior and reduce costs to its clients. Over the recent years, information management and machine learning algorithms are getting more and more close and on topic. Since, information management and machine learning intensely concerns with domain knowledge. Artificial Intelligence allows the machines to accumulate knowledge and adapts it. Information management and machine learning are affected by several factors such as business strategies, customer behavior, effectively using knowledge.

The ANF includes a frequency estimator which estimates the frequency of the vibration in the input signal in real time and automatically filters it out. Because the ANF is designed in the continuous-time domain, a discretization process is required for digital implementation. However, the discretization error may restrain the performance of the ANF, especially when the resonance frequency is near the Nyquist frequency. This paper develops the discretization method for the ANF that combines a modified bilinear transform method with a compensation method for the frequency and damping ratio warping, and a phase compensation technique. The proposed method reduces the magnitude and phase error near Nyquist frequency, and thus the discretized ANF can suppress the resonance in relatively high-frequency.

We demonstrated the gesture reconfiguration from joint failure on the Namo robot, which is a semi-humanoid robot for performing emblematic gestures as a receptionist robot. Four emblematic gestures, including the Thai greeting, salute, bye, and side invite gestures, were demonstrated. The experimental results showed that the BFOA-based gesture reconfiguration could generate a suitable gesture configuration for all four gestures; the resulting gestures are close to the original gestures. We investigated further on tuning the number of population size in BFOA. We varied the number of population size as 15, 25, 50, and 100 and found that although the larger population size could result in better gestures than the smaller size, the improvement in gesture similarity were not significant so it may be more efficient to use the smaller size.

Traditionally, sea turtle individuals are identified through the application of external flipper tags or internal passive integrated transponders. However, such devices might be lost. This paper proposes a method to perform sea turtle identification using image recognition technique. This idea could be possible because each sea turtle has a unique postorbital facial pattern. To avoid light condition and color problem, we create a mesh of facial pattern, and use it as an image for matching process. The proposed method uses a modification of SIFT feature extraction technique to extract feature vector from the input facial image.

1106,1106,IoT Protocols for Low-power Massive IoT: A Communication Perspective,"The constantly growing number of resource-limited MTC (Machine-Type Communication) devices is challenging both the telecommunication operators as well as industrial companies to efficiently design communication technologies, protocols, and end-devices for data transmissions in the upcoming 5G and beyond wireless communication networks. As the communication technologies for mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications)/massive IoT (Internet of Things) attracted significant attention over the past years due to the extended communication range and improved lifetime of battery-operated devices, the debate turned from the communication parameters of available Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWA) technologies towards the implementation issues related to efficient data transmissions with respect to certain level of Quality of Service (QoS). In this regard, this paper aims to analyze already introduced communication protocols (i.e., TCP, UDP, CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)) possible to use for data transmission in massive IoT scenarios. Along with the highlights of the protocols in question, a practical implementation is done using the emerging cellular IoT standard, namely, NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT).

1108,1108,An ensemble method with cost function on churn prediction,"Accurate customer churn classification is vital in any business organisation due to the higher cost involved in getting new customers. In telecommunication businesses, companies have used various types of single classifiers to classify customer churn, but the classification accuracy is still relatively low. However, the classification accuracy can be improved by integrating decisions from multiple classifiers through an ensemble method. Despite having the ability to produce higher classification accuracy, the ensemble method tends to produce similar or redundant classifiers. Therefore, this paper aims to achieve higher classification accuracy and at the same time, minimising ensemble classifiers by constructing a new ensemble method based on dimensionality reduction in soft set theory. The combination of ensemble classifier is calculated based on the simple majority voting algorithm. The performance measure used in determining the optimal subset of classifiers is the combination of Accuracy (ACC), True Negative Rate (TNR) and True Positive Rate (TPR). The proposed soft set ensemble methods (SSPN and SSSC) are systematically evaluated using customer churn data set taken from one of the local Telco companies in Malaysia. The selection and combination algorithm (SSSC) has proven its supremacy by producing accuracy (ACC) of 87.0% for local Telco data set and 94.0% for UCI data set, which is better than any other single classifier. This work proved that the proposed soft ensemble method could search for the minimum number of classifiers in the ensemble repository while at the same time improving the classification performance. In conclusion, the proposed soft ensemble method not only reduces the number of members of the ensemble but is also able to produce the highest classification accuracy.",60103919,Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin,Kuala Terengganu,Malaysia,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.454545454545453,0.0924107142857143,0.3874560335497835,1

In this paper, we experimentally study the performance of a LoRaWAN network composed of multiple end devices and two independently operating gateways (GW) for the case of uplink-only and uplink-downlink traffic. Our results demonstrate that even though the spatial diversity due to the use of multiple GWs improves the performance of the network for the packet error rate, it still does not guarantee low packet loss under heavy uplink network traffic. Nonetheless, when the downlink traffic is present, a second GW operating in the uplink-only mode can dramatically increase the uplink packets delivery rate in the network. Therefore, we consider that spatial decoupling of receiver and transmitters, or addition of uplink-only GWs may become an efficient way to improve the performance of LoRaWAN networks with downlink traffic. Even though the limited laboratory environment might have affected the results of our measurements, we expect that many of the observed trends will also stand for the real-life LoRaWAN deployments.

It has been particularly used to define cryptocurrencies. While inherently secure against classical single node attacks, the blockchain cryptocurrencies have recently been subject to attacks by malwares able to capmre a single user wallet and its included keys. In this work we propose the use of biometric crypto systems to control the access to the wallets on single machines. After a brief description of the blockchain. the cryptocurrencies and the possible attacks, the paper describes the use of convolutional neural network face recognition as a tool to extract biometric features that help in a key binding approach to protect the personal data in the wallet. Experiments have been conducted on three independent face datasets and the results obtained are satisfactory. The equal error rate between false acceptance and false rejection is negligible when testing on images from the same dataset used for the training of the convolutional neural network. This generalizes well when experimenting on two other independent datasets. These results prove that face crypto systems can be used to protect the access on sensitive data existing in the wallets of many cryptocurrencies.",60068775,University of Balamand,Al Koura,Lebanon,['1700'],20.9,0.023761904761904765,0.4153809523809524,0
1112,1112,Time to Lane crossing estimation using deep learning-based instance segmentation scheme,"The main goal of this paper is to develop a deep-learning-based instance segmentation of lane detection for time to lane crossing (TLC) estimation. As is well known, the TLC strategy can build lane departure warning systems (LDWs) with enhanced predictive capabilities which play the role of security early warning in order to prevent dangerous driving situations. LDWs quite relies on the accurate detection of the road markings. Instance segmentation is a task to detect specific objects in an image and create a mask around the object. We use an evolved fully convolutional networks (FCNs) based instance segmentation to yield the highquality segmentation maps with finer details. It is an effective approach to providing us the high accurate lane detection for LDWs. Time to lane crossing (TLC) is a kind of lane departure indicator in LDWs. For TLC computation, both straight and curved vehicle paths are considered. Thus, the road curvature is an important variable in computations. In this paper, a lane mark fitting algorithm based on inverse perspective mapping (IPM) and sliding window technologies are proposed to compute the road curvature. TLC is duration available for the driver before any lane boundary crossing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based instance segmentation can significantly detect the lane. The experiment results illustrate that the proposed TLC estimation strategy can significantly enhance the lane marks recognition accuracy and then provide drivers with timely warnings to avoid unintentional lane departure.",60017511,National Chung Hsing University,Taichung,Taiwan,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",18.384615384615383,0.24568627450980393,0.5891176470588236,1

This paper proposes to combine human-following control with obstacle avoidance, so that the robot can avoid obstacles while simultaneously follow the target person. In this design, obstacle as well as human features are obtained by using a RGB-D camera. A deep neural network(DNN) model works to detect and identify the user in the environment.

This model, together with its variants, is able to provide theoretical feasible solutions to hard computational problems. NPEPE is a software engine able to simulate NPEP which is deployed over Giraph, an ultra-scalable platform based on the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) programming model. Rather surprisingly, the BSP model and the underlying architecture of NPEP have many common points. Moreover, these similarities are also shared with all variants in the NEP family. We take advantage of these similarities and propose an extension of NPEPE (named gNEP) that enhances it to simulate any variant of the NEP's family. Our extended gNEP framework, presents a twofold contribution. Firstly, a exible architecture able to extend software components in order to include other NEP models (including the seminal NEP model and new ones). Secondly, a component able to translate input configuration files representing the instance of a problem and an algorithm based on different variants of the NEP model into some suitable input files for gNEP framework. In this work, we simulate a solution to the ""3-colorability"" problem which is based on NPEP. We compare the results for a specific experiment using NPEPE engine and gNEP.

This platform was developed based on Vygotsky∗s socio-historical theory in order to promote the affective state of interest and joint attention scenes in children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD leads the child to developmental deficit condition, with manifestation scale in the behavioral, communicative and in some cases cognitive domains. Hie interest and joint-attention deficits in children with ASD are also manifestations widely mentioned in the literature. The qualitative methodology is used with case study of multiple cases. An educational storytelling activity was developed using a product called Electronic Puppet, created on the Asistranto Platform. Four storytelling with Electronic Puppet was presented to four autistic students from 7th and 8th grade, limited to 16 cases. The results showed that Asistranto's Electronic Puppet promoted over 80% of joint attention scenes, and an increase of three positive cases without technology to nearly 10 with Electronic Puppet, representing a gain of over 200%.

To accomplish this, we adopt a point cloud deep network to learn the shapes of objects and recognize their surfaces from the partial view. Afterwards, the grasp candidates are inferred based on the object models and reference grasping configuration sets.

An integral indicator of the body's status as a biosystem is the weight, the changes of which often correlate with the processes occurring in this organ. Using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient in studying the effects of iodine-correction of model iodine deficiency has made it possible to establish that the weight of the adrenal glands and liver of rats is associated with the change in the weight of their thyroid glands.

1158,1158,Detection of Facial Symmetric Plane Based on Registration of 3D Point Cloud,"Cleft lip is a birth defect that occurs when the lips are not completely formed during healing of the face of the fetus. In Japan, it occurs in about 1 in 500 people. Although treatment is performed to form a symmetrical outer nose, it is necessary to evaluate the degree of symmetry of the surgical site quantitatively because it is based on the judgment criteria that depend on the doctor's subjectivity. In this paper, we propose a method to detect the plane which is the symmetry basis of the face to analyze the symmetry of the operation site. In the proposed method, the face organ is detected as points from 3D point cloud of the face. Then, the mirror image inversion excluding the area affected by shape change due to cleft lip is aligned with the original point cloud. Next, a symmetric plane is set by finding a plane that bisects vertically between one point in the original point cloud and the corresponding point in the mirror image. As a result of applying the proposed method to real 3D point cloud, we could detect the symmetric plane with good accuracy.",60031838,Kyushu Institute of Technology,Kitakyushu,Japan,"['1702', '1706']",23.75,0.18437499999999998,0.5218750000000001,1

Parts are given and students assemble the parts according to set examples. However, students cannot develop creativity simply by following fixed examples. In order to foster creativity, it is necessary to make mechatronic systems based on students' own ideas. Students also need to study production costs, schedule management, team work etc. These skills are important when becoming engineers in companies after graduation. In order that students can use their own ideas, fabricate mechatronic systems, understand production costs, deal with deadlines and develop a team ethos, we have started a compact electric vehicle competition, named 'pico-EV Eco Challenge', and implemented it. In the competition, a one person small electric vehicle using only small rechargeable batteries (7.2V, 1000mAh in total) is fabricated and runs a 60m circuit.

For all-day vision, a fusion of CCD and Infrared (IR) sensors are inevitable, and fusion of heterogeneous data based on a Convolutional neural network (CNN) is only based on the feature map concatenation of parallel CNN architecture. However, concatenation that is simply applied has a problem in that it can not fully utilize multispectral data in a deep network architecture. Therefore, this paper proposes a method called Feature Map Swap (FMS) of swapping feature maps in addition to concatenation. The proposed method can use multispectral data more efficiently by facilitating learning, by swapping the different domain weights of feature maps besides to concatenation. Also, the proposed method does not require any modifications, such as adding or removing layers to an already configured network architecture. Experimental results show that the performance of the KAIST multispectral pedestrian dataset is improved by about 7-10% based on log-average miss rate compared to simple concatenation.",60001170,Yeungnam University,Gyeongsan,South Korea,"['1702', '1706']",23.142857142857142,0.06,0.5114285714285715,1

The mobile robot is implemented in an open-source robot operating system called ROS to take advantage of open-source packages associated with autonomous navigation. To perform autonomous navigation and provide mobility to the system, it comprises six components: mapping, localization, occupancy grid map, global path planning, local path planning, and ROS communication. The mapping component builds a global map by simultaneous localization and mapping. The localization component estimates the mobile robot's pose within the global map by the adaptive Monte Carlo localization approach. The occupancy grid map component builds a local map for nearby surroundings including dynamic objects. The global path planning component optimizes a route to reach a given target pose. The local path planning component generates a trajectory to reach a local goal while conducting collision avoidance and then produces control commands to follow the trajectory. Last, the ROS communication component connects the mobile robot with the system.

Promoting data sharing, without compromising data sovereignty and traceability, is fundamental since it provides a heterogeneous ecosystem with the potential to enrich the variety of applications and services that take part in this digital revolution. In this scope, the use of secure and trusted platforms for sharing and processing personal and industrial data is crucial for the creation of a data market and a data economy. Protecting data goes beyond restricting who can access what resource (covered by identity and access control respectively): It becomes necessary to control how data are treated, which is known as data usage control. Data usage control provides a common and trustful security framework to guarantee the sovereignty and the responsible use of organizations' data by third-party entities, easing and ensuring data sharing in ecosystems such as industry or smart cities.

1214,1214,Minimum classification error training with speech synthesis-based regularization for speech recognition,"To increase the utility of Regularization, which is a common framework for avoiding the underestimation of ideal Bayes error, for speech recognizer training, we propose a new classifier training concept that incorporates a regularization term that represents the speech synthesis ability of classifier parameters. To implement our new concept, we first introduce a speech recognizer that embeds Line Spectral Pairs-Conjugate Structure-Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction (LSP-CS-ACELP) in a Multi-Prototype State-Transition-Model (MP-STM) classifier, define a regularization term that represents the speech synthesis ability by the distance between a training sample and its nearest MP-STM word model, and formalize a new Minimum Classification Error (MCE) training method for jointly minimizing a conventional smooth classification error count loss and the newly defined regularization term. We evaluated the proposed training method in an isolated-word, closed-vocabulary, and speaker-independent speech recognition task whose Bayes error is estimated to be about 20% and found that our method successfully produced an estimate of Bayes error (about 18.4%) with a single training run over a training dataset without such data resampling as Cross-Validation or the assumptions of sample distribution. Moreover, we investigated the quality of the synthesized speech using LSP parameters derived from the trained prototypes and found that the quality of the Bayes error estimation is clearly supported by the speech synthesis ability preserved in the training.",60010726,Doshisha University,Kyoto,Japan,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",54.75,0.20044063079777366,0.5218769325912183,1

Specifically, the network is trained to generate a spatial arrangement of closed, deformable mesh parts, which respects the global part structure of a shape collection, e.g., chairs, airplanes, etc. Our key observation is that while the overall structure of a 3D shape can be complex, the shape can usually be decomposed into a set of parts, each homeomorphic to a box, and the finer-scale geometry of the part can be recovered by deforming the box. The architecture of SDM-NET is that of a two-level variational autoencoder (VAE). At the part level, a PartVAE learns a deformable model of part geometries. At the structural level, we train a Structured Parts VAE (SP-VAE), which jointly learns the part structure of a shape collection and the part geometries, ensuring the coherence between global shape structure and surface details. Through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state-of-the-art deep generative models of shapes, we demonstrate the superiority of SDM-NET in generating meshes with visual quality, flexible topology, and meaningful structures, benefiting shape interpolation and other subsequent modeling tasks.",60030904,Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1704'],26.571428571428573,-0.019642857142857146,0.2720238095238095,1

A Safe Experimentation Dynamics (SED) algorithm is utilized as a model-free optimization tool to find the optimal PA-PID controller parameters such that the integral square of error and input are reduced. The essential feature of the PA-PID controller is that the parameters of proportional, integral and derivative gains are adaptive to the error variations according to the Piecewise Affine (PA) function. Moreover, the proposed PA function is expected to produce better control accuracy than the conventional PID controller. In order to justify the efficacy of the PA-PID controller, a widely known nonlinear model of DPOC plant is considered. The performances of the proposed controller are observed based on the integral square of error and input, and the responses of the cart position, the hook and load sway angle and the control input.

Eight subjects participated in two experimental sessions of mental arithmetic tasks. The obtained signals are processed by the correlation based signal improvement (CBSI) method and the newly proposed method, respectively. We evaluate accuracy of the hemodynamic response estimation using the correlation between the CBSI estimation and the DEKF estimation while that of the path-lengths using a left-tail t-test on the relative errors between sessions. The noise-resistant performance is validated using the metrics of correlation coefficient analysis and within-subject standard deviation (SD).

In a given application, the multi-dimensional force sensor is always coupled with a load by the screw thread, which may result in a totally different dynamic behavior from a bare force sensor. It is the key data for deeply understanding the dynamic performance to have information about the structural distribution of stiffness and mass of the multi-dimensional force sensor. To address this need, the approach of model-based load characteristic analysis of the multi-dimensional force sensor is presented in this paper. Dynamic behavior of the force sensor in a given load is described by a lumped mass model consists of spring-mass-damper elements and characterized by the model parameters that describe the dynamic correlation distribution of mass, stiffness, and damping.

In this strategy, the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of lignocellulosic biomass are catalytically converted to y-valerolactone (GVL) using the biomass derived GVL as a solvent. To generate the integrated strategy, we develop separation subsystems to achieve high purity of product. Importantly, GVL can be upgraded to 5-nonanone with high yield in a single reactor using a dual catalyst bed of Pd/Nb20s plus ceria-zirconia.

1221,1221,The Influence of Structural Dynamics on Cascaded Joint Position Control of a Flexible Beam with a Compliant Gear,"The structural dynamics of a robot manipulator can have a large influence on its overall dynamic behavior. They can cause unwanted resonances, limit the control bandwidth and lead to instability. For this reason, a significant amount of research has focused on the development of advanced control methods which consider the structural dynamics of a robot. These techniques are, however, still rarely employed in practice due to their complex nature and reliance on accurate models. A popular decentralized control scheme for robot joints is cascaded position, velocity and current control of the motor. The goal of this paper is to visualize the influence of the structural dynamics of a flexible beam and flexible harmonic drive gear on this type of joint controller. The derived effects are explained by mainly relying on simulated and measured transfer functions, without the use of the typical equations. The difference between closing the control loop with position feedback from the motor side or on the joint side after the flexible gear is also investigated.

Cloud computing is often the only possible strategy which allows processing these big amount of information due to the associated costs. However, data owners remain reluctant to outsource their data to a cloud which may read, use or even sell these data leading on user privacy leakage. These threats have been already observed by EU organization and reflected in many regulations and strategies.This paper present data splitting techniques as one of the most promising technology for privacy-preserving computation in a cloud.

The camera is manually operated by the operator. So, there is a problem that some persons are assigned to the camera operators and a difference in work efficiency is caused depending on their skill level. In order to solve this problem, we are developing an automatic tracking camera control system for construction machine operators by using image processing. It works well like manual camera operation. However, the reproduction of the skilled camera operation is still not enough. Therefore, we aimed to improve the system.

We obtained benchmark sound datasets in an outdoor environment that comprises 18 grid points of 40 m width and 30 m depth. For direction estimation, no detection angle error occurred at 9 points.

Due to weak hemodynamic response (HR) signal, the achieved classification accuracies using MI are not sufficiently high. In this study, the enhancement in HR was investigated during motor imagery tasks of ball squeezing with the right hand. Brain signals in the form of concentration changes in oxy-hemoglobin (ΔHbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (ΔHbR) from the left sensorimotor cortex were obtained using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The experiment was separated in two sessions: In the first session the MI task was performed without a visual aid, and in the second session of the same task, the visual aid was provided: A video was played on a screen that showed a person continuously squeezing the ball, which can help in enhancing the imagination, thus improvement in HR. Later the features of averaged ΔHbO were used for classification. The active channels were selected on the basis of t-values and trials of those channels were mean to obtain averaged ΔHbO. Consistent with literature, imagery task with visual aid, showed increased activation in ΔHbO. Moreover, linear discriminant analysis was used to classify signals by taking the mean and peak of the averaged ΔHbO resulting in average classification accuracies of approximately 66% and 77% for MI task, with and without visual aid, respectively.

To realize this goal without unrealistically long training repetitions and strict parameter assumptions, the Bayes Boundary-ness-based Selection (BBS) method was recently proposed and its effectiveness was clearly demonstrated. However, the BBS method remains cumbersome because it consists of two stages: the first generates many candidate sets of trained parameters by carefully controlling the training hyperparameters so that those candidate sets can include the optimal target parameter set; the second stage selects an optimal set from candidate sets. To resolve the BBS method's burden, we propose a new one-stage training method that directly optimizes a given classifier parameter set by maximizing its Bayes boundary-ness or increasing its accuracy during Bayes error estimation. We experimentally evaluate our proposed method in terms of its accuracy of Bayes error estimation over four synthetic or real-life datasets.

However, to promote continuous therapy, the use of robots could be extended for assisting parents or caregivers as well. Our group developed a robot called BLISS, which is a mobile robot with friendly toy-like appearance and sensors, to interact with children. The BLISS robot has been used to assist in learning interventions for autistic children through games. Previous studies showed that children paid attention and responded to the robot differently. Inexperienced parents often struggle to provide therapy to their autistic child. If the robot could learn to detect child attention and interact with the child appropriately, could the robot better help maintain child attention to the activity in therapy session? In this study, we developed an attention detection model based on child behavior during activity with the robot. We collected the child behavior data and the child psychologist evaluation for the behavior. We built the attention detection model for 2 levels of attention (high and low) by using k-nearest neighbor classifier, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest. From the experiment, the random forest model returned the highest accuracy at 70%. We employed the model in the adaptive interaction system where the robot selects action based on child attention.

Early detection and early treatment of lung cancer are important. Especially, early detection of the abnormalities on thoracic MDCT images detection of small nodules is required in visual screening. Although a CT apparatus is used for the examination, the burden on the image interpretation doctor is large due to the high performance of the CT, so the diagnostic accuracy may be reduced. In this paper, we propose an image analysis method to detect abnormal shadows from chest CT images automatically. The initial lesion candidate areas are extracted by using temporal subtraction technique that emphasizes temporal change by subtracting from a current image to previous one which is obtained same subject. The image of the area is given as input and classification is performed by CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).

The longitudinal length of the dynamic zone has flexible distances. To make the decision of lane change, collision risk assessment index (CRAI) and vehicle cooperative interaction index (VCII) are proposed to evaluate the driving situations. The CRAI is computed as a ratio of distance collected by automotive radar sensors and pre-defined distance of the dynamic zone. The VCII is available by analyzing an interaction with surrounding vehicles. To verify the methodology, scenario-based experiments were performed in real time with test vehicles in proving ground.

1246,1246,Optimal placement of charging stations for electric vehicles in large-scale transportation networks," Published by Elsevier B.V.This paper presents a new practical approach to optimally allocate charging stations in large-scale transportation networks for electric vehicles (EVs). The problem is of particular importance to meet the charging demand of the growing fleet of alternative fuel vehicles. Considering the limited driving range of EVs, there is need to supply EV owners with accessible charging stations to reduce their range anxiety. The aim of the Route Node Coverage (RNC) problem, which is considered in the current paper, is to find the minimum number of charging stations, and their locations in order to cover the most probable routes in a transportation network. We propose an iterative approximation technique for RNC, where the associated Integer Problem (IP) is solved by exploiting a probabilistic random walk route selection, and thereby taking advantage of the numerical stability and efficiency of the standard IP software packages. Furthermore, our iterative RNC optimization procedure is both pertinent and straightforward to implement in computer coding and the design technique is therefore highly applicable. The proposed optimization technique is applied on the Sioux-Falls test transportation network, and in a large-scale case study covering the southern part of Sweden, where the focus is on reaching the maximum coverage with a minimum number of charging stations. The results are promising and show that the flexibility, smart route selection, and numerical efficiency of the proposed design technique, can pick out strategic locations for charging stations from thousands of possible locations w ithout numerical difficulties.",60016636,Blekinge Tekniska Högskola,Karlskrona,Sweden,['1700'],30.875,0.11113481756338897,0.4116852195423624,0
1247,1247,Capturing smoker in non-smoking room,"In developing countries legal actions regarding violations of smokers in non-smoking areas are still weak. This will be very disturbing especially those who care for their own health. Eastern cultures are generally reluctant to treat smokers who violate the rules directly. Therefore, other methods are needed, such as creating a set of cigarette smoke detection systems that can warn smokers not to do it in a place that is forbidden to smoke. This device is expected to detect cigarette smoke, then at the same time take photos of suspected smokers as evidence of violations. Warnings will be carried out by authorized persons, if the alarm signal of cigarette smoke is not also heeded. The device consists of NodeMCU, MQ-2, piezo speakers, and ArduCAM OV2640. When the device detects cigarette smoke, it will push a beep sound, capture images of the room, and immediately send images to the Cloud database. A few moments later the mobile phone supervisor of the room will get a proof of the incident and immediately take an action to reprimand and arrest the perpetrators. The testing of cigarette smoke detection devices was carried out in a cardboard room with a volume of 50cm x 50cm x 75cm. Detection was carried out at 4 different points from the source of cigarette smoke each of 6 x experiments or 24 x experiments. It was found, that the speed of detection of cigarette smoke was achieved on average 14.4 seconds with the device located above the source of cigarette smoke (75cm).",60070441,Universitas Pelita Harapan,Tangerang,Indonesia,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.0,-0.010526315789473679,0.4118421052631579,1

Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) was used to learn denial-of-service attack and distributed denial-of-service attack. It analyzes packet states to determine the nature of an attack and adds that piece of information to the flow table entry. The proposed Secured-OF model in Ryu controller was evaluated with several performance metrics. The analytical evaluation of the proposed Secured-OF scheme was performed on an emulated network.

Unlike other cooperative methods such as slung-load transportation and aerial manipulator, the system can accommodate simpler mechanism by directly attaching cargo to the multirotor body. We build the dynamic model of the system and design a trajectory tracking controller considering low-level control. Dynamic equations show that the system is overactuated and it can follow arbitrary twice-differentiable trajectory if input and mechanical feasibilities are satisfied. For tracking control, linear control methods with linear quadratic regulator(LQR) and PID are sufficient for stable and efficient tracking.

The key is to establish nonlinear regression model since the uncertainty of measurement error. In this paper, the Support Vector Regression(SVR) methodology was adopted to estimate the true location of target based upon the measurement results of multi-source radar. We uniquely identify a region by a sequence of radar id which means a target can be detected in this area by radars with id listed in the sequence. Different regression model was established in different region which are independent of each other. Since the coordinate system used by radar data and ADSB data is different, we mapped all the data into the same twodimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

It becomes even more acute when using the existing toolkit for the processing and transmission of encrypted images with the fluctuation intensity function. Hie authors developed a modification of the RSA algorithm to use it in relation to the above-mentioned images. It is proposed a conceptual view for the joint use of quaternary fractional-linear transformations with elements of the basic RSA algorithm. The application of this mathematical apparatus in the basic RSA algorithm avoids contours of image objects in an encrypted sample. In addition, this combination provides additional stability to the basic RSA algorithm for unauthorized decryption. The simulation of the method was earned out in two described by the authors algorithms: Using one line and four lines of the image matrix, for grayscale and color images.

Our work proposes similarity metrics that are extended for a weighted bipartite social network to predict prospective links in the social network by applying a supervised machine learning scheme. Link (edge) weights in the network could provide valuable information for prediction as they express the strength of relationships between nodes (person, item etc.). The target attribute of prediction is a label that shows the existence or absence of a link between two nodes in the network. The feature attributes of the machine learning model are similarity/centrality metrics calculated from the current social network. Particularly, a weighted bipartite graph was built from the MovieLens dataset by connecting users to movies via the users' movie ratings; then new links were attempted to predict for a later time. Several types of machine learning algorithms for link prediction on this bipartite graph were applied by using network similarity metrics and a binary supervised classifier. The combination of four network centrality metrics provided higher prediction performance compared their individual performances on the bipartite movie ratings network.

This have created a growing need to improve our online networks performance and their immunity to online network attacks and anomalies. One approach to improve the network's performance is to predict future bandwidth demands. With accurate forecasting and comparing the forecasted network with real time bandwidth measurement, network management techniques such as resource allocation, traffic engineering, and detection of anomalies become less complex. To this end, a twostage network analysis model is proposed. In the first stage, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to predict future bandwidth demands. The ANN is trained using a set of data collected from a local network over the period of five months. The forecasting ANN is tested for different prediction periods. The results are compared to real-time bandwidth measurements. The comparison shows that the forecasting ANN achieves an accuracy level of at least 96.7% for normal network operation. In the second stage, another ANN is used to classify the behavior of the network as normal or anomaly. In this work, the anomalies considered are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and link failures. Experimental DDoS attacks and link failures were performed to measure the network's behavior. The ANN in the second stage is trained and tested using the difference between the forecasted and real time bandwidth for different periods of time.

1279,1279,Efficiently predicting frequent patterns over uncertain data streams," Published by Elsevier.recent decades, frequent pattern mining has become popular in real time computing because it helps users extract meaningful business or technical trends over uncertain data streams. Generally, mainstream frequent pattern mining approaches can accurately explore frequent patterns whether the approaches are used in expected support or prob-abilistic frequentness mechanisms. However, whichever are implemented, they all have time issues when extracting frequent patterns if there exists a volume of data tuples in each time instance. To explore frequent patterns over uncertain data streams efficiently, we propose a predicted approach for forecasting frequent patterns with hidden Markov models. The model consists of a construction phase and a testing phase. In the former phase, the hidden Markov model is constructed by the history of past data, and in the latter phase, the results of evaluations and adjustments of transition probabilities occur. By constructing models of patterns, frequent patterns can be easily obtained. Experimental results show the proposed approach can save time cost when exploring frequent patterns and provide approximate 72% average accuracy in 50 sequential predictions; thereby, our approach can efficiently and accurately predict frequent patterns over uncertain data streams.",60012392,National Taipei University of Technology,Taipei,Taiwan,['1700'],23.75,0.09038461538461542,0.37756410256410255,0

Further, in order to follow the mainstream neural network architecture, we define a favorable activation function and corresponding loss function for the clustering iteration.

The individual measurement of the object pose is assumed to be Gaussian (on SE(3)). We investigate an iterative scheme for the agents to cooperatively compute the optimal pose of the object, which minimizes a maximum likelihood cost, in a distributed fashion. By linearizing the pose perturbations at the optimal pose we formulate the problem as a linear maximum likelihood (ML) estimation at each iteration.

Then, comprehensive optimization of slip ratio error with its change rate is taken as control objective, and analytical solutions of optimal slip ratio and traction control torque are derived through minimum principle. And then, real time cooperative computation of traction torque without any adhesion coefficient information of complex road conditions can be accomplished by utilizing analytical solution of optimal slip ratio with feedback signals such as traction acceleration, vehicle speed and angular velocity of tire. Effectiveness of proposed optimal control for tracing different target slip ratios in different complex road conditions is investigated through MATLAB/Simulink numerical evaluation. It can be concluded that feedback slip ratio synchronizes with target slip ratio at any specified time, and also slip ratio error is determined by its initial value and ratio between weight of slip ratio error and that of its change rate in control objective functional. Besides, inevitable chattering of feedback slip ratio along sliding mode surface occurred in sliding mode control processes for slip ratio tracking is prohibited.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) Peer-review under responsibility of the Conference Program Chairs.In developing countries, it is often difficult to use web content for e-learning because Internet accessing is unavailable or limited. To support education in such a situation, the authors previously proposed a system that uses a delayed update-tolerant web cache server and a wireless LAN. This system stores e-learning webpages requested by free school children in a cache memory, which is then carried to the free school so that the children can access the webpages in an off-line environment. The present paper proposes a cache deletion algorithm that reflects children's requests for content retention in the cache server. It is called a user-oriented least recently used (LRU) algorithm. We have developed an experimental system that implemented this algorithm and carried out a learning experiment under conditions that simulated actual usage.

1298,1298,Data Preprocessing Method in Motor Fault Diagnosis Using Unsupervised Learning,"Motor failure diagnosis using the existing deep learning is a lot of research using the CNN algorithm. Supervised learning is an algorithm in which a user specifies a correct answer of data and learns based on the correct answer. Therefore, CNN is very clear to classification of characteristics data. However, data that is not learned cannot be classified. The existing fault diagnosis using CNN failed to verify the data even if only the sensor measuring vibration in the same environment was changed. In this paper, a research was conducted using the K-means algorithm, which is unsupervised learning. In order to apply K-means to fault diagnosis, FFT data is divided by frequency. The center point is calculated by applying K-means algorithm for each frequency. The correct data set was determined based on the input data. Using the input data, the answer data set is calculated similarity and distance to the centroid of the cluster classified by each frequency, and the data with high probability are selected to classify the correct answer data set classified as K-means as normal or fault. By using the above method, even if the sensor is changed, it is possible to verify the data of similar trend. In order to verify the proposed algorithm, data were collected using different sensors and compared with the conventional CNN algorithm. The CNN failed to classify the data when the sensor was changed, but the proposed algorithm classified the data and showed high accuracy.",60024472,Hoseo University,Asan,South Korea,"['1702', '1706']",18.692307692307693,-0.05997023809523808,0.45065476190476184,1

But the existence of malicious nodes, this information will be deleted from the network.

This has become a problem in our society, especially because this is raising a level of risk for other people within the intersection. This means that bikers, walkers, and other cross-traffic drivers are placed in an unfair position because of the decisions and actions of drivers who choose to illegally cross the intersection at a red light. Therefore, this system was put in place to help prevent this and hold drivers accountable in order to ensure that, despite law enforcement not being in place to monitor the situation, consequences are given to those that did not follow this traffic regulation. This allowed for drivers to become aware of the red light cameras and follow the rules, as well as making it possible to give tickets to the drivers that continued to break the rules. While this is the first approach to further developing tracking systems for this type of illegal activity, the cameras remain basic enough that they do not always capture correct image processing.

1327,1327,Shapeglot: Learning language for shape differentiation,"In this work we explore how fine-grained differences between the shapes of common objects are expressed in language, grounded on 2D and/or 3D object representations. We first build a large scale, carefully controlled dataset of human utterances each of which refers to a 2D rendering of a 3D CAD model so as to distinguish it from a set of shape-wise similar alternatives. Using this dataset, we develop neural language understanding (listening) and production (speaking) models that vary in their grounding (pure 3D forms via point-clouds vs. rendered 2D images), the degree of pragmatic reasoning captured (e.g. speakers that reason about a listener or not), and the neural architecture (e.g. with or without attention). We find models that perform well with both synthetic and human partners, and with held out utterances and objects. We also find that these models are capable of zero-shot transfer learning to novel object classes (e.g. transfer from training on chairs to testing on lamps), as well as to real-world images drawn from furniture catalogs. Lesion studies indicate that the neural listeners depend heavily on part-related words and associate these words correctly with visual parts of objects (without any explicit supervision on such parts), and that transfer to novel classes is most successful when known part-related words are available. This work illustrates a practical approach to language grounding, and provides a novel case study in the relationship between object shape and linguistic structure when it comes to object differentiation.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,"['1712', '1707']",22.0,0.12678571428571428,0.4194940476190476,1

In this regard, the optimal design of traffic light settings plays a fundamental role in the definition of solutions to achieve a safe and sustainable mobility in urban environments. The efficient operation of the traffic light network involves different approaches that can be classified in terms of the considered network configuration, modelling framework and strategy. In this paper, a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperation for traffic management is considered, in order to maximize the intersection capacity. Thus, the flow variability detected through V2I communications is taken into account by the responsive traffic light plans. The proposed strategy is compared with a video analytics-based solution performed by cameras monitoring the intersection, with the aim to evaluate the performance robustness of both camera and V2I-based approaches.

The original DSMC with DDC method has several features such as excellent trajectory tracking, easy implementation, and robustness to disturbances. However, when the system suffers from ramp-type disturbance such as viscosity friction, position error remains and overshoot arises at the end of motion. They are highly undesirable in position control applications such as robot manipulators and manufacturing systems. In this paper, a new structure of DSMC with DDC is developed to reduce the overshoot. An outer loop is added to the original DSMC with DDC structure, which provides asymptotic convergence of the error state subject to ramp-type disturbance. A transfer function is derived to analyze the overshoot performance. Experiments are performed on an industrial linear motor system to demonstrate the improved overshoot performance.",60120116,Automation and Systems Research Institute,Seoul,South Korea,"['1702', '1706']",18.25,0.11759740259740259,0.5353246753246752,1

For wiring harness assembly tasks, knowing the accurate pose of the grasped cable connector in the gripper is very critical for the successful mating process, and conventional mating processes rely on force control or mechanical passive compliance. Nowadays, we notice that collaboration robotic manipulators or small size industrial robotic manipulators attain high accuracy and repeatability levels (sub-millimeter) thus demonstrate very precise position control capacities. Using those capacities of the robotic manipulator, we analyze the permissible error range of connector for the mating process. For that reason, we propose a new design of a gripper for an accurate alignment and holding of the position between the cable and the gripper. Therefore, if we know the exact position of the connector in reference to the gripper, and the tolerance between the connectors is larger than error position of the robot arm, the mating process can be achieved by just using position control of conventional industrial robots.",60072061,Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral Ecuador,Guayaquil,Ecuador,"['1702', '1706']",33.0,0.13427849927849925,0.5627801827801828,1

However, V2V channels over mmWave have not been well studied as of yet due to the complexity of measurements, especially if there is a need to estimate the contribution of adjacent interfering vehicular transceivers. Moreover, the channel models that are currently in use consider vehicles on the road according to a certain distribution, which may not be accurate in practice. Also, past models do not take into account the effects of reflection, diffraction, and transmission through obstacles, as well as the physical properties of vehicles themselves.

The proposed design condition is bilinear in the decision variables, and hence we provide an iterative algorithm to solve the design problem. At each iteration, the design condition can be cast as standard convex optimization using the sum-of-squares technique and thus can be efficiently solved via the existing software tools.

1375,1375,Frequency-domain Analysis of A Modified Active Disturbance Rejection Control with Application to Superheated Steam Temperature Control,"Superheated steam temperature (SST) systems face many control difficulties caused by unknown disturbances and high order dynamics. This is becoming more and more severe due to the rapid growing of intermittent renewable generation. To improve the tracking and disturbance rejection performance of SST systems, a modified active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is proposed. Based on its equivalent structure, this paper develops the frequency-domain analysis of the modified ADRC to present the influence of parameters on the control performance. Then the modified ADRC based on the frequency-domain analysis is applied to the SST control to verify the superiority of the modified ADRC. Based on the results of the simulation and the field application on a power plant simulator, the modified ADRC can obtain the best tracking performance with a small overshoot and short settling time compared with other comparative controllers. Besides, the modified ADRC has the smallest fluctuation range of SST under the input disturbance and load varying conditions. The superiority of the modified ADRC ensures the satisfactory control performance and shows a great potential in industrial applications.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"['1702', '1706']",22.125,0.2117777777777778,0.506,1

1377,1377,Method for removing motion blur from images of harmful biological organisms in power places based on improved cyclegan,"Nowadays, the automatic detection of harmful organisms in power places has attracted attention due to the extensive unattended way of power places. However, surveillance pictures are prone to motion blurring and harmful organisms cannot be effectively detected due to their frequent and fast movements in power places. On the basis of the improved Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) model, we propose a method for removing motion blur from the images of harmful biological organisms in power places. This method does not require paired blurred and real sharp images for training, which is consistent with actual requirements. In addition, our method improves the classical CycleGAN model by combining cycle consistency and perceptual loss to enhance the detail authenticity of image texture restoration and improve the detection accuracy. The model uses Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) as a loss function to train the depth model. Given the existence of the GAN itself, the entire real image distribution space is difficult to fill with the generated image distribution space. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves the detection accuracy of harmful organisms in power places.",60017605,Fuzhou University,Fuzhou,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",23.0,0.07416666666666666,0.48388888888888887,1
1378,1378,Sensitivity Analysis of Generalized Gaussian Process Models for Variable Importance Measure,"In machine learning, Gaussian process regression (GPR) has been gaining popularity due to its nonparametric Bayesian form. However, the traditional GPR model is designed for continuous real-valued outputs with a Gaussian assumption, which does not hold in some engineering application studies. For example, when the output variable is count data, it violates the assumptions of the GPR model. Generalized Gaussian process regression (GGPR) can overcome the drawbacks of the conventional GPR, and it allows the model outputs to be any member of the exponential family of distributions. Thus, GGPR is more flexible than GPR. However, since GGPR is a nonlinear kernel-based method, it is not readily accessible to understand the effect of each input variable on the model output. To tackle this issue, the sensitivity analysis of GGPR (SA-GGPR) is proposed in this work. SA-GGPR aims to identify factors that exert higher influence on the model output by utilizing the information from the partial derivative of the GGPR model output with respect to its inputs. The proposed method was applied to a nonlinear count data system. The application results demonstrated that the proposed SA-GGPR is superior to the PLS-Beta, PLS-VIP, and SA-GPR methods in identification accuracy.",60011001,Kyoto University,Kyoto,Japan,"['1702', '1706']",19.6,0.11183035714285713,0.5071428571428571,1

Due to decoupling the spatial streams by linear precoding, an adaptation at the transmitter side is enabled which targets a constant minimum distance of all constellation sets at the receiver side. Indeed, this fact supports the distinctiveness of different modulation schemes at the receiver. Simulations of typical indoor propagation scenarios reveal an increased modulation classification reliability compared to previous methods. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed adaptive transmission scheme clearly outperforms both a signaling-based adaptive and a non-adaptive concept, especially at lower signal-to-noise power ratios.",60014264,Universität Duisburg-Essen,Essen,Germany,['1705'],23.8,-0.051190476190476175,0.4797619047619048,1

However, creating a new font for Chinese characters takes a lot of e-ort because the language contains over 20 thousand character with complex morphological structures. Current font completion methods have many disadvantages. To address this problem, we propose StarFont, a font completion system that can automatically complete a whole font using a few-shot learning method. Our model takes several examples of a new font, learns the design style and applies it to the remaining characters to complete the font. Unlike existing models proposed for font generation, we treat each character not the font as a class and abandon reconstruction loss because the font's ground truth is easier to obtain. Moreover, we combine multiple input images to generate new images, while existing methods use a one-toone approach. Compared to other deep learning-based font completion methods, our model requires fewer examples of the new font and generates better results.

Indeed, reuse supports the semantic interoperability among different datasets and applications, increases accuracy, and reduces engineering costs and efforts. Nevertheless, many problems aiise during the process since the latter is far from being automated, and instead requires significant commitment from the knowledge engineer. Inconsistencies have to be resolved when the same concepts are differently represented in different ontologies or some parts reused have to be altered.

However, it is hard for inexperienced beginners to control the welfare vehicle in narrow places such as rooms and corridors. For the problem, the driving assist system for the welfare vehicle which is steered from an objective viewpoint with a transmittable Head Mounted Display (HMD) has been proposed in complex driving areas. Also, the autonomous driving system which can be used in safe areas for the driver has been studied. The advanced function which switches the driving assistance and the autonomous driving is needed because the welfare vehicles drive in the complex driving situations. In this paper, an autonomous driving system is proposed using the wearable MR-device which has collision avoidance function using the spatial mapping. As the system uses the virtual vehicle to avoid the obstacle, this system will be easy to switch the driving assistance and the autonomous driving. The obstacles are modeled by the spatial mapping installed in wearable HMD. Using the virtual vehicle drawn by the hologram, the autonomous system is steered using A∗ and NavMesh system on Unity.

1387,1387,Information protection service using topological image coverage," Published by Elsevier B.V.Information protection services based on the use of elements of the RSA algorithm are quite reliable because the cryptostability of this method is high (RSA keys from 2048 bits and more). However, in terms of image encryption, in some cases, this algorithm leaves outlines of objects in an encrypted image. This imposes a number of additional limitations on the application of this algorithm. Avoiding partially saving contours in encryption using RSA can be by splitting the initial image into paits so that the image coating is topologically locally finite, that is, compact. The paper proposes a method of encryption-decryption using elements of the RSA algorithm and the topological image coverage. Such a combination will provide both a avoiding of the aforementioned disadvantage and an additional increase in cryptostability. The simulation of the method was done on grayscale and color images using two developed algorithms. Hie absence of contours of objects of input images in encrypted images of both types is experimentally established.

The results show that the BBV weighted network is easier to accelerate knowledge diffusion, and the community knowledge variance is smaller. Knowledge absorptive capacity of community users is conducive to knowledge growth, but knowledge variance increases accordingly.

1403,1403,A New Semantic Descriptor for Data Association in Semantic SLAM,"To successfully implement SLAM based on semantic information, object recognition is essential. In our semantic SLAM approach, the robot should localize itself knowing only the pose of the surrounding objects. The implicit information in TOSM contains conceptual knowledge, in which we stored data that cannot be perceived by sensors only. However, it needs to distinguish not only an object class, but also which specific object instance a given detected object is related to. In many approaches, objects are recognized by detecting feature points and representing them as descriptors. There are several types of descriptors for feature points, such as SIFT and SURF.

The aforementioned robust control scheme involves an observer-based input-output exact feedback linearization (EFL) controller, a robust feedback controller, and an observer. The gain of the robust feedback controller and the observer is a binomial coefficient-type gain. In addition, through an quasi-similarity transformation (QST), the robust control scheme is applied to an observer-based approximate feedback linearization(AFL) method.

1405,1405,Energy-efficient sensor-based EEG features' extraction for epilepsy detection," Published by Elsevier B.V.The deployment of wireless body sensor (WBS) in e-health systems represents an attractive solution due to the low-cost and the wearability of these devices. WBS(s) can be used for automatic detection of epileptic seizures which can considerably improve the patients' quality of life. However, the main challenge that faces the sensor-based solution is the energy efficiency. In this context, this paper proposes a new energy efficient scheme for onset epilepsy seizure detection for non-invasive EEG using wireless body sensor networks. This new scheme is based on local features' extraction using Haar wavelet transform of the segmented EEG signal. If the epilepsy seizure is detected, a notification is then transmitted to a remote server. The paper discusses the design of this scheme. It also presents the performances' analysis for epilepsy detection and its energy efficiency when implemented in sensors. The results show that for 10 sec segments, the proposed scheme has sensitivity of 97% and it saves 46% sensor energy compared to full streaming of the raw EEG data to remote server.",60029533,King Saud University Medical College,Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,['1700'],19.444444444444443,0.07566343912497756,0.3906894387663619,0

1410,1410,Learning adaptive hierarchical cuboid abstractions of 3D shape collections," Publication rights licensed to ACM.Man-made 3D objects as assemblies of primitives, i.e. , shape abstraction, is an important task in 3D shape understanding and analysis. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning method for automatically constructing compact and expressive shape abstractions of 3D objects in a class. The key idea of our approach is an adaptive hierarchical cuboid representation that abstracts a 3D shape with a set of parametric cuboids adaptively selected from a hierarchical and multi-level cuboid representation shared by all objects in the class. The adaptive hierarchical cuboid abstraction offers a compact representation for modeling the variant shape structures and their coherence at different abstraction levels. Based on this representation, we design a convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting the parameters of each cuboid in the hierarchical cuboid representation and the adaptive selection mask of cuboids for each input 3D shape. For training the CNN from an unlabeled 3D shape collection, we propose a set of novel loss functions to maximize the approximation quality and compactness of the adaptive hierarchical cuboid abstraction and present a progressive training scheme to refine the cuboid parameters and the cuboid selection mask effectively. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on various 3D shape collections and demonstrate its advantages over the existing cuboid abstraction approach. We also illustrate applications of the resulting adaptive cuboid representations in various shape analysis and manipulation tasks.",60098464,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,China,['1704'],25.77777777777778,0.21111111111111114,0.6000000000000001,0

The method admits anomalous measurement errors in the measurement channels (the azimuth and the angle of elevation) of particular system locators such that neither the number of uncertain channels neither the time moments of the appearance of these errors are known (only the greatest possible number of uncertain channels is known).

Beside the classic task scheduling activity, handling input data for tasks becomes one of the most challenges towards intensive-data applications. In fact, input data should normally be gathered on the same datacenter where the task is scheduled for execution. So, to meet that, migration strategies are required for distant data and should be as efficient as possible. Data migration strategies consist on moving data across geographically distributed data centers in order to execute tasks in the cloud. Therefore, we need to know statistics about the entire mechanism, which has led us to extend Cloudsim, a popular simulation toolkit for large scale cloud computing infrastructures and application services. In this paper, we show how Cloudsim can be investigated to provide a scalable module able to simulate and perform data migration in cloud applications.

1415,1415,Mathematical modeling and prediction of the effectiveness of surgical treatment in surgery of the spine and pelvic complex," All rights reserved.Based on the study of the literature on the quality assessment of operative treatment in reconstructive surgery of the spine and pelvic complex, it can be concluded that, as a rule, multiple linear or logistic regression, a decision tree, is used to predict the quality of operative treatment. Neural networks are less commonly used. Forecasting is performed on the basis of a comparison of the pre- and postoperative condition of the patient, assessed according to various ordinal and quantitative scales as a result of interviewing the patient. With a relatively small number of analyzed cases of the disease (several tens or hundreds) and a small number of indicators (no more than two or three dozen), the use of neural networks seems premature for two reasons: a small amount of data allows analyzing them with classical methods of mathematical statistics, and identifying dependencies on a given stage requires constant ""manual"" intervention, taking into account information from the subject area. The application of statistical analysis methods to data on the treatment of chronic injuries showed the presence of standard problems for medical data. This is the presentation of the initial information in nominal or ordinal scales, the subjective nature of some indicators, as well as the interdependence of the presented characteristics, which reduces the quality of research. The search for the objective function that characterizes the quality of surgical treatment has shown the ambiguity of solving this problem even for a highly specialized situation. The identification of objectively present relationships also revealed a large number of problems, especially related to the choice of the type of surgical treatment, which is largely determined by the experience of the surgeon. Based on the study, it was proposed to build a model for predicting the quality of surgical treatment, based on expert assessments in the form of a forecast tree with recommended surgical treatment options and a statistical forecast based on the available experience. It is assumed that the model will be dynamic with feedback and be able to self-update. To predict the quality of surgical treatment in reconstructive surgery of the spine and pelvic complex, it is advisable to use a forecast tree, which allows us to recommend the type of surgery for a specific case of injury or disease and calculate the predicted values of quality of life indicators.",60068671,Saratov State University,Saratov,Russian Federation,['1712'],35.36363636363637,-0.02659863945578232,0.2802551020408164,0
1416,1416,Analysis of the evolution of the Spanish labour market through unsupervised learning," All rights reserved.Unemployment in Spain is one of the biggest concerns of its inhabitants. Its unemployment rate is the second highest in the European Union, and in the second quarter of 2018 there is a 15.2% unemployment rate, some 3.4 million unemployed. Construction is one of the activity sectors that have suffered the most from the economic crisis. In addition, the economic crisis affected in different ways to the labour market in terms of occupation level or location. The aim of this paper is to discover how the labour market is organised taking into account the jobs that workers get during two periods: 2011-2013, which corresponds to the economic crisis period, and 2014-2016, which was a period of economic recovery. The data used are official records of the Spanish administration corresponding to 1.9 and 2.4 million job placements, respectively. The labour market was analysed by applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to obtain a clear and structured information on the employment generation process and the underlying labour mobility. We have applied two clustering methods with two different technologies, and the results indicate that there were some movements in the Spanish labour market which have changed the physiognomy of some of the jobs. The analysis reveals the changes in the labour market: the crisis forces greater geographical mobility and favours the subsequent emergence of new job sources. Nevertheless, there still exist some clusters that remain stable despite the crisis. We may conclude that we have achieved a characterisation of some important groups of workers in Spain. The methodology used, being supported by Big Data techniques, would serve to analyse any alternative job market.",60033284,University of Seville,Sevilla,Spain,['1700'],22.666666666666668,0.12822966507177033,0.26778309409888357,0
1417,1417,"Development of applications for humanoid robots using multiple platforms, tools, and cloud data sharing","This paper describes the procedure followed for using third-party tools and applications, avoiding the development of complex communication software modules for data sharing. A common practice in robotics is the use of middlewares to interconnect different software applications, hardware components, or even complete systems. It allows code and tool reuse minimizing the development effort. In this way, applications developed for one middleware can be shared with others by means of establishing communication bridges among them. The most extended procedure is the development of software modules that use the low-level communication resources that middlewares provide. This procedure has many advantages but a clear disadvantage: the complexity of development. The procedure proposed is based on the use of cloud technologies for data sharing without the development of middleware bridges. The way of inter-relate different middlewares is by means of the development of a compatible robot model.

The NFS represents a multivariate function of state variables which carries useful information of a target system for control. The main idea of the proposed optimal estimation algorithm includes two stages: the optimal Kalman estimate of a state vector computed at the first stage is nonlinearly transformed at the second stage based on the NFS and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Some challenging theoretical aspects of analytic calculation of the optimal MMSE estimate are solved by usage of the multivariate Gaussian integrals for the special NFS such as the Euclidean norm, maximum and absolute value. The polynomial functions are studied in detail. In this case the polynomial MMSE estimator has a simple closed form and it is easy to implement in practice. We derive effective matrix formulas for the true mean square error of the optimal and suboptimal quadratic estimators. The obtained results we demonstrate on theoretical and practical examples with different types of NFS. Comparison analysis of the optimal and suboptimal nonlinear estimators is presented.

Accordingly, we design two customized modules, cascade corner pooling, and center pooling, that enrich information collected by both the top-left and bottom-right corners and provide more recognizable information from the central regions. On the MS-COCO dataset, CenterNet achieves an AP of 47.0 %, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors by at least 4.9%.

1423,1423,Assessing reliability of big data stream for smart city,"Proliferation of IoT (Internet of Things) and sensor technology has expedited the realization of Smart City. To enable necessary functions, sensors distributed across the city generate a huge volume of stream data that are crucial for controlling Smart City devices. However, due to conditions such as wears and tears, battery drain, or malicious attacks, not all data are reliable even when they are accurately measured. These data could lead to invalid and devastating consequences (e.g., failed utility or transportation services). The assessment of data reliability is necessary and challenging especially for Smart City, as it has to keep up with velocity of big data stream to provide up-to-date results. Most research on data reliability has focused on data fusion and anomaly detection that lack a quantified measure of how much the data over a period of time are adequately reliable for decision-makings. This paper alleviates these issues and presents an online approach to assessing Big stream data reliability in a timely manner. By employing a well-studied evidence-based theory, our approach provides a computational framework that assesses data reliability in terms of belief likelihoods.

Automatic bone age evaluation is an example of the implementation of this technology in the medical field. The automated assessment is done based on the left-hand X-ray images. This assessment helps the radiologist and pediatrician evaluate children's growth. A system that can generate a precise and reliable prediction is essential. Thus the main challenge is to determine the suitable technology that can generate a reliable forecast, mainly when working with a large quantity of data. Big data is a growing trend; practical computing challenges created by data streams can be found in several types of applications. It is known that data streams are usually obtained from sensors and monitors which accumulatively can make data very large in volume. This can result in the inability of real-time processing to be carried out. In this paper, the data stream technique is utilized to assess and predict bone ages. The analysis process is carried out in real-time when the data arrives so that the process of storing new data is done after the data is analyzed. A 9 GB sized-dataset consisting of 12,611 images were used. The images have various resolutions. We extracted and analyzed image features by using Canny Edge feature extraction. To predict bone age from those extracted features, we enhance the data stream mining technique base on tree stream mining. We use MAE or Mean Absolute Error, RMSE or Root Mean Squared Error, and MAPE or Mean Absolute Percentage Error as metrics in this measurement.

The memory devices comprising a typical sandwich structure of Ag (top)/ZrO2 (active layer)/Ti (bottom) are fabricated using a facile spin-coating method. The optimized device exhibits a high resistance state/low resistance state resistance difference (about 10 Ω), a good cycle performance (the number of cycles larger than 100), and a relatively low conversion current (about 1 µA).

1428,1428,The vision 2030: Corporate governance perspective in Saudi Arabia," All rights reserved.This paper reviews the relationships between the prevention system of Corruption, corporate governance (CG) and economic development in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The drive behind the Saudi transformational-economic started is attributable to a spread of things just like the drop in the oil prices in 2015-2016, OPEC’s member’s disagreement on reducing productions, the invention of oil in North America etc. In spite of the new changes on Kingdom of Saudi Arabia main oil-revenue generating mechanism, McKinsey’s report of 2015 is suggesting that their planned “productivity-led transformation model of the Saudi economy” is capable of 1) changing the sector of the Saudi economy 2) developing new productivity and growth venues 3) doubling Saudi brand value, 4) inventing as many as six million new Saudi jobs by 2030. Moreover, such social enterprise is calculable by McKinsey to cost $4 trillion in investments. To boot, McKinsey’s report allegedly highlights eight existing sectors namely: mining & metals, petrochemicals, producing, retail and wholesale trade, business enterprise and welcome, health care, finance, and construction and turning out with are capable of tributary over hour of the overall growth needed to double Saudi worth by 2030. Moreover, the McKinsey report signifies the grouping responsibility and responsibility to accelerate and reach the desired goals of their “comprehensive model that integrates the Kingdom’s economic, marketplace, and public finance perspectives” via a collective effort. Not entirely that but the report to boot signifies the roles Saudi private companies and international companies can play in reworking the Saudi economy and “accelerate the Kingdom’s modernization”. Above all, the special company governance issues with banks, family-owned firms, and state-owned firms are not well understood; neither square measure the character and determinants of public and private group action.

1429,1429,MPCC - Generic secure multi-party computation in centralized cloud-based environments,"Comparing business KPIs with other market participants through benchmarking is a means for companies to optimize costs. Those collaborative optimizations require data of all participating actors that might include business secrets and, therefore, must be kept private in many cases. This demonstrates the demand for privacypreserving Big Data analytics. Over the last decades, a variety of mechanisms and protocols that enable privacy-preserving collaborative computations have been presented such as trusted third party (TTP) approaches or secure multi-party computation (MPC). However, existing solutions for privacy-preserving benchmarking often only compute a fixed set of arithmetic functions and usually follow a decentralized communication scheme among all peers. We will instead investigate a generic secure MPC system that (1) can compute more general functions, (2) discuss benefits of a service-provider oriented centralized setup and (3) determine the class of arithmetic functions that the selected secure computation mechanism can compute feasibly in practice. Our solution proposes an architecture that can calculate functions containing an arbitrary number of additions, subtractions and multiplications, which is capable to operate in scalable cloud environments with also a larger number of peers with the objective to deliver computation results within 24 hours.",60008069,Technische Universität Chemnitz,Chemnitz,Germany,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",27.428571428571427,0.10375000000000001,0.3883333333333333,1

Large quantities of the process data are collected from different sensors during the PECVD process, which are high-dimensional and highly correlated. Most existing research only focus on the analysis of single sensor data instead of multi-sensor data. However, the information contained in single sensor data is incomplete. In this paper, the method of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is adopted to analysis multi-sensor big data form PECVD process. The regression model between the multi-sensor data and the quality of solar cells is established for quality prediction.

1432,1432,SmartPaint: a co-creative drawing system based on generative adversarial networks,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a significant role in imitating and producing large-scale designs such as e-commerce banners. However, it is less successful at creative and collaborative design outputs. Most humans express their ideas as rough sketches, and lack the professional skills to complete pleasing paintings. Existing AI approaches have failed to convert varied user sketches into artistically beautiful paintings while preserving their semantic concepts. To bridge this gap, we have developed SmartPaint, a co-creative drawing system based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), enabling a machine and a human being to collaborate in cartoon landscape painting. SmartPaint trains a GAN using triples of cartoon images, their corresponding semantic label maps, and edge detection maps. The machine can then simultaneously understand the cartoon style and semantics, along with the spatial relationships among the objects in the landscape images. The trained system receives a sketch as a semantic label map input, and automatically synthesizes its edge map for stable handling of varied sketches. It then outputs a creative and fine painting with the appropriate style corresponding to the human’s sketch. Experiments confirmed that the proposed SmartPaint system successfully generates high-quality cartoon paintings.",60117933,"State Key Lab of CAD&amp;CG, Zhejiang University",Hangzhou,China,"['1711', '1708', '1705']",19.0,0.22374999999999998,0.5770833333333333,1

Tile boundaries are dynamically shifted depending on the tile cost, a value that denotes predicted computational complexity of a single tile in a frame. The overall cost of a tile is determined as a combination of costs of three computationally most expensive and resource-hungry operations in HEVC encoding: prediction, transformation, and entropy coding. The algorithm aims at exploiting different types of processing architectures, from homogeneous multicore CPU architectures to heterogeneous architectures in the actual conditions in which streaming servers operate. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms uniform tiling, by up to 5.5% in processing time, while maintaining the same video quality and bitrate. Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves up to 8.85% speedup depending on the number of videos that are being encoded concurrently on a video streaming server.",60008408,University of Zagreb,Zagreb,Croatia,['1700'],26.5,0.002857142857142861,0.28059523809523806,1

We found that practical math understanding was gained while playing Minecraft but transferred poorly to evaluation items that measured traditional conceptual understanding. Participants used spatial geometry concepts effectively in their camp activities, as evidenced in their digital artifact creations, but post-test math scores did not improve significantly.

1446,1446,An energy constraint approach to improve lifetime and reduce routing overhead in heterogeneous MANET,"Heterogeneous Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (H-MANET) contain different configuration nodes, each of which communicates over a wireless channel and is capable of movement. Heterogeneous wireless networking has attracted lot of interest from consumers in the previous few years for its applications in mobile and personal communications. One of the main constraints in MANET is the high probability of failure due to energy-exhausted nodes. So if the path selected for communication has low battery life then the path breaks prematurely and the re-discovery phase starts, which costs more overhead in the network. Therefore, there is unequal consumption of node energy, which must be prevented. The energy expenditure of the nodes should be balanced in order to minimize path breakage. This can be done by finding the communication path that is the most energy-efficient among alternative disjoint paths. This approach reduces path breakage and routing overhead caused by nodes with low battery life dying in the communication path, thus increasing the network’s lifetime.",60120915,Galgotias University,Greater Noida,India,['1700'],20.0,0.05525641025641025,0.3626923076923076,1

However, the actual (serious) game application in schools is still limited, partly because teachers consider their use as a complex process. To increase game adoption, the integration of Game Learning Analytics (GLA) can provide teachers a thorough insight into the knowledge acquired by their students and usually presented through a visual dashboard. Although it is possible to provide a useful general metrics and a prefab dashboard, it may not fully cover teachers’ expectations. In this paper, we study the ad-hoc adaptation of generic dashboards to increase their effectiveness through three case-studies. In these experiences, we adapt dashboards for teachers to include detailed information for more-focused analysis. With the positive results obtained from these scenarios, we have identified a methodological process to create ad-hoc GLA dashboards and extracted some lessons learned for dashboard development: Simple but useful dashboards can provide a higher added value for stakeholders compared with more complex dashboards; teachers and game developers should be involved in dashboard design for better results; and, if possible, ad-hoc developed dashboards should be used as they have proved to be more effective than generic dashboards.",60027282,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,Madrid,Spain,['1700'],30.142857142857142,0.06696248196248196,0.4172222222222223,1

There are several applications that use paraphrasing, for example linguistic steganography, recommender systems, machine translation, etc. One method for paraphrasing sentences is by using synonym substitution, such as the NGM-based paraphrasing method proposed by Gadag et al. The weakness of this method is that ambiguous meanings frequently occur because the paraphrasing process is based solely on n-gram. This negatively affects the naturalness of the paraphrased sentences. For overcoming this problem, a contextual synonym substitution method is proposed, which aims to increase the naturalness of the paraphrased sentences. Using the proposed method, the paraphrasing process is not only based on n-gram but also on the context of the sentence such that the naturalness is increased.

1456,1456,Implementing flipped classroom that used a context aware mobile learning system into learning process,"UCS.While some studies indicate that Hipped classrooms offer many positive educational outcomes, other studies draw attention to limitations associated with Hipped classroom (students’ limited preparation prior to class, students’ need for guidance at home, students’ inability to get immediate feedback while they study at home, and little research has focused on students’ learning outcomes, such as: Satisfaction and motivation). This paper attempts to address several of these limitations through exploratory studies conducted in an Algerian University. The approach proposed in this paper called Flipped classroom based on Context- Aware mobile learning system (FC-CAMLS) aims to provide learners with an adapted course content format based on their feedback and context. The latter has a significant influence on multimedia content in adaptive mobile learning. The system was implemented in an English Language course. It was expected that the FC-CAMLS increased the management of students’ heterogeneity. A quantitative analysis by means of structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the causal relationships between knowledge, skills, motivation and students’ satisfaction. The results show that the system has positive effects on students’ knowledge, skills, and motivation. Finally, our research provides useful results that the use of the context dimensions and learner’s feedback in adaptive mobile learning is more beneficial for learners especially in the Hipped classroom.",60102124,Université Fédérale Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées,Toulouse,France,['1700'],23.444444444444443,0.11292720437457279,0.38861927546138075,1
1457,1457,Modified predictive torque control method of induction machines for torque ripple reduction,"Direct torque control, model predictive control and field oriented control are control methods mostly used in high performance induction machine drives. In the direct torque control method, control variables are estimated from the stator variables, and the only parameter required is the stator resistance. The predictive torque control with horizon one has recently attracted much research attention but it requires the use of the induction machine speed, and both the stator and the rotor parameters, usually requires adjustment of the weighting factors, and has high computational burden. This paper proposes a modified predictive torque control method of induction machines. The estimated and predicted values are calculated from the stator variables, and the method uses the cost function without the weighting factor. When the two-level three-phase voltage source inverter is analyzed, it is shown that the predicted values should be calculated for three voltage vectors. The modified predictive torque control results in a better steady state performance regarding torque ripple in comparison with the conventional direct torque control and the predictive torque control methods. Simulation and experimental results for the main propulsion drive of the low-floor tram are presented in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",60098308,"KONČAR - Institut za elektrotehniku, d.d.",Zagreb,Croatia,['1700'],24.75,0.12403174603174608,0.43803174603174605,1
1458,1458,"Computational personality recognition from Facebook text: psycholinguistic features, words and facets","Advances in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning fields have led to the development of automated methods for the recognition of personality traits from text available from social media and similar sources. Systems of this kind exploit the close relation between lexical knowledge and personality models–such as the well-known Big Five model–to provide information about the author of an input text in a non-intrusive fashion, and at a low cost. Although now a well-established research topic in the field, the computational recognition of personality traits from text still leaves a number of research questions worth further exploration. In particular, this paper attempts to shed light on three main issues: (i) whether we may develop psycholinguistics-motivated models of personality recognition when such knowledge sources are not available for the target language under consideration; (ii) whether the use of psycholinguistic knowledge may be still superior to contemporary word vector representations; and (iii) whether we may infer certain personality facets from a corpus that does not explicitly convey this information.

1460,1460,Adaptive normalization in streaming data,"In today's digital era, data are everywhere from Internet of Things to health care or financial applications. This leads to potentially unbounded ever-growing Big data streams and it needs to be utilized effectively. Data normalization is an important preprocessing technique for data analytics. It helps prevent mismodeling and reduce the complexity inherent in the data especially for data integrated from multiple sources and contexts. Normalization of Big Data stream is challenging because of evolving inconsistencies, time and memory constraints, and nonavailability of whole data beforehand. This paper proposes a distributed approach to adaptive normalization for Big data stream. Using sliding windows of fixed size, it provides a simple mechanism to adapt the statistics for normalizing changing data in each window. Implemented on Apache Storm, a distributed realtime stream data framework, our approach exploits distributed data processing for efficient normalization. Unlike other existing adaptive approaches that normalize data for a specific use (e.g., classification), ours does not. Moreover, our adaptive mechanism allows flexible controls, via user-specified thresholds, for normalization tradeoffs between time and precision. The paper illustrates our proposed approach along with a few other techniques and experiments on both synthesized and real-world data. The normalized data obtained from our proposed approach, on 160,000 instances of data stream, improves over the baseline by 89% with 0.0041 root-mean-square error compared with the actual data.",60021285,Texas Tech University,Lubbock,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",18.5,0.0625,0.3566071428571428,1

Such a finite population coincides with those coherent previsions of a univariate random quantity representing all possible alternatives considered “a priori”. We consider a discrete probability distribution of all possible samples. We approximately get the standardized normal distribution from this probability distribution. Within this context an event is not a measurable set so we do not consider random variables viewed as measurable functions into a probability space characterized by a σ-algebra. Anyway, a parameter space is always provided with a metric structure that we introduce after studying the range of possibility.

1469,1469,Closed vortex lines in fluid and gas," All rights reserved.Continuous fluid and gas flows with closed vortex tubes are investigated. The circulation along the vortex line of the ratio of the density of the resultant of all forces (applied to the fluid or gas) to the density of the fluid or gas is considered. It coincides with the circulation (along the same vortex line) of the partial derivative of the velocity vector with respect to time and, therefore, for stationary flows, it is equal to zero on any closed vortex line. For non-stationary flows, vortex tubes are considered, which remain closed for at least a certain time interval. A previously unknown regularity has been discovered, consisting in the fact that at, each fixed moment of time, such circulation is the same for all closed vortex lines that make up the vortex tube. This regularity is true for compressible and incompressible, viscous (various rheologies) and non-viscous fluids in a field of potential and non-potential external mass forces. Since this regularity is not embedded in modern numerical algorithms, it can be used to verify the numerical calculations of unsteady flows with closed vortex tubes by checking the equality of circulations on different closed vortex lines (in a tube). The expression for the distribution density of the resultant of all forces applied to fluid or gas may contain higher-order derivatives. At the same time, the expression for the partial derivative of the velocity vector with respect to time and the expression for the vector of vorticity (which is necessary for constructing the vortex line) contain only the first derivatives; which makes it possible to use new regularity for verifying the calculations made by methods of high and low orders simaltaniously.",60069256,Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University),Moscow,Russian Federation,['1712'],31.22222222222222,0.006195569136745609,0.3610090399796282,0

1481,1481,FASTER: Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner for Flights in Unknown Environments,"High-speed trajectory planning through unknown environments requires algorithmic techniques that enable fast reaction times while maintaining safety as new information about the operating environment is obtained. The requirement of computational tractability typically leads to optimization problems that do not include the obstacle constraints (collision checks are done on the solutions) or use a convex decomposition of the free space and then impose an ad-hoc time allocation scheme for each interval of the trajectory. Moreover, safety guarantees are usually obtained by having a local planner that plans a trajectory with a final 'stop' condition in the freeknown space. However, these two decisions typically lead to slow and conservative trajectories. We propose FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to overcome these issues. FASTER obtains high-speed trajectories by enabling the local planner to optimize in both the free-known and unknown spaces. Safety guarantees are ensured by always having a feasible, safe back-up trajectory in the free-known space at the start of each replanning step. Furthermore, we present a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program formulation in which the solver can choose the trajectory interval allocation, and where a time allocation heuristic is computed efficiently using the result of the previous replanning iteration. This proposed algorithm is tested extensively both in simulation and in real hardware, showing agile flights in unknown cluttered environments with velocities up to 3.6 \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}.",60022195,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",24.77777777777778,0.06462450592885376,0.4480237154150198,1

1484,1484,Periodically varied initial offset boosting behaviors in a memristive system with cosine memductance,"A four-dimensional memristive system is constructed using a novel ideal memristor with cosine memductance. Due to the special memductance nonlinearity, this memristive system has a line equilibrium set (0, 0, 0, δ) located along the coordinate of the inner state variable of the memristor, whose stability is periodically varied with a change of δ. Nonlinear and one-dimensional initial offset boosting behaviors, which are triggered by not only the initial condition of the memristor but also other two initial conditions, are numerically uncovered. Specifically, a wide variety of coexisting attractors with different positions and topological structures are revealed along the boosting route.

The boundary conditions on the propagating growing surface (PGS) is the fundamental problem of this branch of mechanics. Results from the algebra of rational invariants are used for deriving constitutive equations on PGS. Geometrically and mechanically consistent differential constraints are obtained on PGS. Those are valid for a wide range of materials and metamaterials. A number of constitutive equations on PGS of different complexity levels are proposed. The boundary conditions simultaneously can be treated as differential constraints within the frameworks of variational formulations. The differential constraints imply an experimental identification of constitutive functions. For this reason, the obtained results furnish a general ground in applied problems of the MGS.",60014483,Ishlinsky Institute for Problems in Mechanics of the Russian Academy of Sciences,Moscow,Russian Federation,['1712'],14.88888888888889,0.05000000000000001,0.35833333333333334,0

Learning style of specific users in an online learning system is determined based on their interaction and behavior towards the system. The most common online learning theory used in determining the learning style is the Felder-Silverman’s Learning Style Model (FSLSM). Many researchers have proposed machine learning algorithms to establish learning style by using the log file attributes. This helps in determining the learning style automatically. However, current researches still perform poorly, where the range of accuracy is between 58%-89%. Hence, RF(Xgb) is proposed to help in improving the learning style prediction. This hybrid algorithm was further enhanced by optimizing its parameters. From the experiments, RF(Xgb) was proven to be more effective, with accuracy of 96% compared to J48 and LSID-ANN algorithm from previous literature.",60000906,Universiti Sains Malaysia,Gelugor,Malaysia,['1702'],16.77777777777778,0.05069444444444444,0.5076388888888889,0

1489,1489,Stochastic models of just-in-time systems and windows of vulnerability in terms of the processes of birth and death," All rights reserved.The paper proposes a method for constructing models based on the analysis of birth and death processes with linear growth in semimartingale terms. Based on this method, stochastic models of simple just-in-time systems (analyzed in the theory of productive systems) and windows of vulnerability (widely discussed in risk theory) are considered. The main results obtained in the work are presented in terms of the average values of the time during which the processes reach zero values. At the same time, they are considered and used in the study of assessment models for local times of the processes. Here, simple Markov processes with a linear growth of intensities (perhaps, depending on time) are analyzed. At the same time, the obtained and used estimates are of theoretical interest. Thus, for example, the average value of the stopping time, at which the process reaches zero, depends on functions such as the harmonic number and the remainder term for the logarithmic function in the Taylor theorem. As the main result, the method of mathematical modeling of just-intime systems and windows of vulnerability is proposed. The semimartingale description method used here should be considered as the first step of such a modeling, since, being a trajectory method, it allows diffusion (including non-Markov processes) generalizations when constructing stochastic models of windows of vulnerability and just-in-time. In the theoretical part of the article, we formulate statements for the average values of the local time and the stopping times when the birth and death processes reach a given value. This allows us to uniformly present estimates for the models of the just-intime system and for windows of vulnerability, the result for which is given in the form of a limit theorem. The main results are formulated as theorems and lemmas. The proofs use semimartingale methods.",60069249,Ulyanovsk State University,Ulyanovsk,Russian Federation,['1712'],23.076923076923077,0.009999999999999998,0.2548809523809524,0

The motivation of this work was to solve the issue of the gain of LNAs designed using the most commonly used technique, i.e. simultaneous conjugate match (SCM), which often produce an increase of other parameter values, i.e. noise figure and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR). Prior to hardware implementation, the circuit simulation software Advanced Design System (ADS) was applied to design the two-stage S-band LNA and to determine the desired trade-off between its parameters. The proposed two-stage S-band LNA was deployed on an Arlon DiClad527 using a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), type BFP420. Meanwhile, to achieve impedances that match the two-stage S-band LNA circuit, microstrip lines were employed at the input port, the interstage, and the output port. Experimental characterization showed that the realized two-stage S-band LNA produced a gain of 22.77 dB and a noise figure of 3.58 dB at a frequency of 3 GHz. These results were 6.1 dB lower than the simulated gain and 0.76 dB higher than the simulated noise figure respectively.",60110394,Pakuan University,Bogor,Indonesia,['1700'],21.444444444444443,0.09166666666666667,0.3638888888888889,1

Profiling and analysis of the encoding process identified Discrete cosine transform (DCT) as one of the key kernels that consume most of the time in the application’s runtime. Therefore, high-throughput, fully-pipelined hardware accelerator was designed in FPGA and integrated into MANGO platform. MANGO platform is heterogeneous HPC system that consists of different types of nodes, from general purpose nodes (GN) to heterogeneous nodes (HN). While executing specific kernels on GN nodes is a straightforward process, executing kernels on accelerator-based HNs is a more complex procedure and requires specific integration to successfully exploit heterogeneous architecture. This paper presents performance-efficient integration of DCT hardware accelerator in MANGO platform, focusing on the performance of the encoder while maintaining coding efficiency and video quality of the encoded bitstream.

For more effective tracking and attack against a submarine the depth of the target is a critical factor. However, it has been difficult to find out the depth of a submarine until now. In this paper a possible solution to the depth estimation of submarines is proposed utilizing DIFAR (Directional Frequency Analysis and Recording) sonobuoy information such as contact bearings at or prior to CPA (Closest Point of Approach) and the target's Doppler signals. The relative depth of the target is determined by applying the Pythagorean theorem to the slant range and horizontal range between the target and the hydrophone of a DIFAR sonobuoy. The slant range is calculated using the Doppler shift and the target’s velocity. the horizontal range can be obtained by applying a simple trigonometric function for two consecutive contact bearings and the travel distance of the target. The simulation results show that the algorithm is subject to an elevation angle, which is determined by the relative depth and horizontal distance between the sonobuoy and target, and that a precise measurement of the Doppler shift is crucial.",123864612,Korea Navy Airwing 6 Operations Department,Pohang,South Korea,['1711'],24.875,0.058333333333333334,0.49940476190476185,0

1499,1499,Autonomous underwater vehicle depth control based on an improved active disturbance rejection controller,"Large fluctuation, large overshoot, and uncertain external disturbance that occur when an autonomous underwater vehicle is in deep motion are difficult to address using the traditional control method. An optimal control strategy based on an improved active disturbance rejection control technology is proposed to enhance the trajectory tracking accuracy of autonomous underwater vehicles in actual bathymetric operations and resist external and internal disturbances. First, the depth motion and mathematical models of an autonomous underwater vehicle and propeller are established, respectively. Second, the control rate of the extended state observer and the nonlinear error feedback of the traditional active disturbance rejection control are improved by using a new nonlinear function. The nonlinearity, model uncertainty, and external disturbance of the autonomous underwater vehicle depth control system are extended to a new state, which is realized by an improved extended state observer. Third, the improved nonlinear state error feedback is used to suppress residual errors and provide high-quality control for the system. Simulation and experimental results show that under the same parameters, the traditional active disturbance rejection control has a small overshoot, fast tracking ability, and strong anti-interference ability. The optimized active disturbance rejection control and traditional active disturbance rejection control are applied to the deep-variation motion of autonomous underwater vehicles.

Like most machine learning and data mining algorithms, Apriori algorithm is designed for in-memory data. One natural way to cope with this limitation and emerging Bigdata challenges is to adapt the algorithm to parallel and distributed computing infrastructures, particularly a widely used Map-Reduce model. Much research has developed a variety of MapReduce-based Apriori algorithms. However, most have focused on either improving performance over that of the original Apriori algorithm or mechanisms MapReduce infrastructure. This paper presents yet another MapReduce-based Apriori algorithm. Unlike most traditional MapReduce-based Apriori that mimics incremental level-wise computation of the original Apriori, our MapReduce-based algorithm opportunistically exploits the map's keys for non-level-wise parallelism to fully benefit of parallel processing to gain efficiency. The paper describes our proposed approach and shows an empirical evaluation of its performance compared with that of the representative traditional MapReduce-based algorithm. The results show significant improvement with an average reduction of the execution time of about 70%, over 50,000-200,000 transactions on one to three machines, with 10% of support threshold.

Accuracy of mid-term rainfall prediction on islands with complex orography is generally low when carried out with atmospheric models.

When comparing the proposed models, we evaluated accuracy, kappa and interpretability of the model obtained, as well as the relevance of the predictors used.

1509,1509,Segmentation and classification of cervical cells using deep learning,". All rights reserved.Cervical cancer is the fourth most prevalent disease in women. Accurate and timely cancer detection can save lives. Automatic and reliable cervical cancer detection methods can be devised through the accurate segmentation and classification of Pap smear cell images. This paper presents an approach to whole cervical cell segmentation using a mask regional convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) and classifies this using a smaller Visual Geometry Group-like Network (VGG-like Net). ResNet10 is used to make full use of spatial information and prior knowledge as the backbone of the Mask R-CNN. We evaluate our proposed method on the Herlev Pap Smear dataset. In the segmentation phase, when Mask R-CNN is applied on the whole cell, it outperforms the previous segmentation method in precision (0.92±0.06), recall (0.91±0.05) and ZSI (0.91±0.04). In the classification phase, VGG-like Net is applied on the whole segmented cell and yields a sensitivity score of more than 96% with low standard deviation (±2.8%) for the binary classification problem and yields a higher result of more than 95% with low standard deviation (maximum 4.2% in accuracy measurement) for the 7-class problem in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, h-mean, and F1 score.",60069380,Universitas Gadjah Mada,Yogyakarta,Indonesia,['1700'],21.666666666666668,0.15873015873015875,0.2992063492063492,1

In this paper, we propose a combined structure of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and MultiTask AutoEncoder (MTAE) as deep learning architecture that integrates the strength of MTAE and WGAN respectively such that it estimates not only noise but also speech features from noisy acoustic source. The proposed MTAE-WGAN structure is used to estimate speech signal and the residual noise by employing a gradient penalty and a weight initialization method for Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (LReLU) and Parametric ReLU (PReLU). The proposed MTAE-WGAN structure with the adopted gradient penalty loss function enhances the speech features and subsequently achieve substantial Phoneme Error Rate (PER) improvements over the stand-alone Deep Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), MTAE, Redundant Convolutional Encoder-Decoder (R-CED) and Recurrent MTAE (RMTAE) models for robust speech recognition.",60005273,Korea University,Seoul,South Korea,['1711'],39.5,0.04285714285714286,0.5071428571428571,0

Because the spatial characteristics, attribute characteristics, associations, etc. of information objects change with time dimension, various topological relationships are intertwined. The existing spatiotemporal data structure model is difficult to express the temporal and spatial characteristics of information objects and the dynamic evolution of spatiotemporal relationships. Not conducive to the query of time and space nodes. On the other hand, the space-time model mostly stays in the theoretical stage and lacks practical application. The main work of this research is as follows:1. For the spurious coupling of spatiotemporal relationship of existing spatiotemporal data, reconstruct spatiotemporal data, design spatiotemporal data structure, and sort out spatiotemporal relationship. 2.A multi-timeline ground state correction model based on region contour is proposed, which reduces the storage redundancy of spatial information, improves the efficiency of information query, and improves the scalability of the system. 3.Design and implement a time-space-based hierarchical spatiotemporal correlation information system, which flexibly switches the spatiotemporal background of information objects at different time nodes, realizes the dynamic linkage of spatiotemporal data, and facilitates data analysis and data mining of spatiotemporal objects.",60108071,"Shandong University, Weihai",Weihai,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",18.9,0.0046296296296296285,0.4157407407407408,1

1514,1514,Synthesis of the Optimal Control of the Spacecraft Orientation Using Combined Criteria of Quality,"Abstract: The dynamic problem of a spacecraft’s (SC) rotation from an arbitrary initial angular position to a given final angular position is considered and solved. The case is investigated when the control is limited, and the minimized functional combines, in a given, proportion, the time of the maneuver and the integral of the energy of rotation. The construction of the optimal control is based on the quaternionic differential equation relating the vector of the angular momentum of the SC with the quaternion of the orientation of the body-related coordinate system. The control law is formulated in the form of an explicit dependence of the control variables on the phase coordinates. The analysis of the special control regime of the SC is carried out. Based on the conditions of transversality, as the necessary conditions for optimality, the optimal value of the kinetic energy of rotation when moving in a special control regime is determined. The created control algorithms allow turning of an SC with a kinetic rotation energy, which does exceed a predetermined level. For a dynamically symmetric SC, the problem of spatial reorientation is solved completely. The results of the mathematical modeling of the motion of an SC under the optimal control are presented, demonstrating the practical feasibility of the developed algorithm for controlling the spatial orientation of the SC.",106591407,Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1710', '1707', '1705']",24.444444444444443,0.06753246753246754,0.43203463203463205,1

The gravitational and restoring aerodynamic torques acting on the satellite are taken into account. Based on the principles of the proportional-differential regulator, we construct the control laws for the gyrostatic momentum, which allow, without its accumulation, maintaining a long and sufficiently accurate orientation of the satellite in the vicinity of gravitationally stable and unstable rest positions that exist in the simplified problem (the satellite moves in a fixed circular orbit under the action of the gravitational torque only; the gyrostatic momentum is zero).",60010862,Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1710', '1707', '1705']",34.0,-0.005555555555555548,0.4703703703703705,1

All rights reserved.DNS DDoS attacks may severely affect the operation of computer networks, prompting the need for methods able to timely detect them, and then to apply mitigation countermeasures. Visual models have been used to detect an ongoing DDoS attack, but often demand continuous attention from IT staff. However, machine learning techniques could complement a visual model with further information and with on-time alerts that could help IT officers give attention only when an attack is in progress at its very early stage. In this paper, we present DNS-ADVP, a DNS Anomaly Detection Visual Platform, which, in an integrated manner, provides a novel visualisation that depicts on-line DNS traffic, and a one-class classifier that deals with traffic anomaly detection. Using the visual mode, an IT officer may interpret the current state of traffic for an authoritative DNS server; the model comes with visual semaphores, controlled by the one-class classifier. Due to the highly dynamic nature of DNS traffic, our classification method continuously updates what counts as normal behaviour; it has been successfully tested on synthetic attacks, with an 83% of the area under the curve (AUC).

1523,1523,High-level synthesis of multiclass SVM using code refactoring to classify brain cancer from hyperspectral images," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Currently, high-level synthesis (HLS) methods and tools are a highly relevant area in the strategy of several leading companies in the field of system-on-chips (SoCs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). HLS facilitates the work of system developers, who benefit from integrated and automated design workflows, considerably reducing the design time. Although many advances have been made in this research field, there are still some uncertainties about the quality and performance of the designs generated with the use of HLS methodologies. In this paper, we propose an optimization of the HLS methodology by code refactoring using Xilinx SDSoCTM (Software-Defined System-On-Chip). Several options were analyzed for each alternative through code refactoring of a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier written in C, using two different Zynq®-7000 SoC devices from Xilinx, the ZC7020 (ZedBoard) and the ZC7045 (ZC706). The classifier was evaluated using a brain cancer database of hyperspectral images. The proposed methodology not only reduces the required resources using less than 20% of the FPGA, but also reduces the power consumption −23% compared to the full implementation.

1524,1524,Design and implementation of moving object visual tracking system using µ-synthesis controller,"Considering the increasing use of security and surveillance systems, moving object tracking systems are an interesting research topic in the field of computer vision. In general, a moving object tracking system consists of two integrated parts, namely the video tracking part that predicts the position of the target in the image plane, and the visual servo part that controls the movement of the camera following the movement of objects in the image plane. For tracking purposes, the camera is used as a visual sensor and applied to a 2-DOF (yaw-pitch) manipulator platform with an eye-in-hand camera configuration. Although its operation is relatively simple, the yaw-pitch camera platform still needs a good control method to improve its performance. In this study, we propose a moving object tracking system on a prototype yaw-pitch platform. A µ-synthesis controller was used to control the movement of the visual servo part and keep the target in the center of the image plane.

The method build up from the ideas behind the TV-L1 approach introduced by Zach, Pock and Bischof in 2007 but incorporating information that allows to detect occlusions. This information is based on the divergence of the flow and the proposed energy favors the location of occlusions on regions where this divergence is negative. The implemented variational method uses three consecutive frames. The energy functional is composed of regularization terms using the total variation, a data term using the L1 norm, and a term dealing with the occlusions. In the present implementation, we solve the stationary system of partial differential equations arising from the dual minimization problem associated with the TV operator by a variation of the box relaxation numerical scheme proposed by Garamendi, Gaspar, Malpica and Schiavi.

The mechanism of thermal conductivity is considered as simple thermodiffusion. Hemitropic constitutive constants are reduced to a minimum set nevertheless retaining hemitropic constitutive behaviour and thermoelastic semi-isotropy. Solutions of thermoelastic coupled equations in the form of propagating plane waves are studied. Their spatial polarizations are determined. An algebraic bicubic equation for the determination of wavenumbers is obtained. It is found that for a coupled thermoelastic wave actually there are exactly three normal complex wavenumbers.

1527,1527,TASED-net: Temporally-aggregating spatial encoder-decoder network for video saliency detection,"TASED-Net is a 3D fully-convolutional network architecture for video saliency detection. It consists of two building blocks: First, the encoder network extracts low-resolution spatiotemporal features from an input clip of several consecutive frames, and then the following prediction network decodes the encoded features spatially while aggregating all the temporal information. As a result, a single prediction map is produced from an input clip of multiple frames. Frame-wise saliency maps can be predicted by applying TASED-Net in a sliding-window fashion to a video. The proposed approach assumes that the saliency map of any frame can be predicted by considering a limited number of past frames. The results of our extensive experiments on video saliency detection validate this assumption and demonstrate that our fully-convolutional model with temporal aggregation method is effective. TASED-Net significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on all three major large-scale datasets of video saliency detection: DHF1K, Hollywood2, and UCFSports.

The one-parameter bifurcation with respect to externally applied current stimuli suggests a periodic window between two stable fixed point solutions in the HH model.

1531,1531,Analyses on limitations of binaural sound based on the first order Ambisonics for virtual reality audio," All rights reserved.This paper analyzes the limitations of binaural sound that is reproduced with headphones based on Ambisonics for Virtual Reality (VR) audio. VR audio can be provided with binaural sound that compensates head rotation of a listener. Ambisonics is widely used for recording and reproducing ambient sound fields around a listener in VR audio, and the First order Ambisonics (FOA) is still being used for VR audio because of its simplicity. However, the maximum frequencies with this order is too low to perfectly reproduce ear signals, and thus the binaural reproduction has inherent limitations in terms of spectrum and sound localization. This paper investigates these limitations by comparing the signals arrived at ear positions in the reference field and the reproduced field. An incidence wave is defined as a reference field, and reproduced over virtual loudspeakers. Frequency responses, inter-aural level differences, and inter-aural phase differences are compared. The results show, above the maximum cut off frequency in general, that the reproduced levels decrease, and the horizontal localization can be provided only around the forward direction.",60028270,Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science,Yusong,South Korea,['1711'],22.125,0.2545454545454545,0.47575757575757577,0
1532,1532,Bird sounds classification by combining PNCC and robust Mel-log filter bank features," All rights reserved.In this paper, combining features is proposed as a way to enhance the classification accuracy of sounds under noisy environments using the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) structure. A robust log Mel-filter bank using Wiener filter and PNCCs (Power Normalized Cepstral Coefficients) are extracted to form a 2-dimensional feature that is used as input to the CNN structure. An ebird database is used to classify 43 types of bird species in their natural environment. To evaluate the performance of the combined features under noisy environments, the database is augmented with 3 types of noise under 4 different SNRs (Signal to Noise Ratios) (20 dB, 10 dB, 5 dB, 0 dB).

1534,1534,Performance evaluation of a modified waveform shaping filter for the underwater acoustic communication," All rights reserved.The transmitted acoustic signals are severely influenced by multiply reflected signals from boundaries, such as sea surface and bottom in the shallow water. Very large reflection signals from boundaries cause inter-symbol interference so that the performance of the underwater acoustic communication is degraded. Usually, the waveform shaping filters are used to prevent the reflected signals under this kind of acoustic channel. Especially, the raised cosine filter is widely used, which can also be used to restrict the bandwidth of the transmitted signal. In this study, we evaluate the raised cosine filter for image data transmission in the shallow water, and propose a new modified raised cosine filter. The QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) system is used for the underwater acoustic communication simulations with different distances and symbol rates.

Today, big data has relevant applications in the industry due to improvements in the system performance and by turning information into knowledge. Big data challenges include the lack of strategies to process computational cost and the large amount of data when computing machine learning predictions. To overcome these scalability issues, it is convenient to work with distributed and parallelized architecture across multiple nodes. The approach is based on Apache Spark, an in-memory distributed application that offers extensive machine learning libraries. The main contribution of the study is to measure the scalability by calculating the execution time that a classifier achieves with larger workloads. We validate our classifier models with experiments on logistic regression and random forest by studying their adaptability to the Apache Spark framework. The present work expects to combine the areas of big data and machine learning on scalability, and the use of optimization methods, cache and persist.

In this paper, a novel approach to extract course patterns from AIS data of vessels is presented. From machine learning and natural language processing principles, a topic model might be used for extracting implicit patterns underlying massive and unstructured collection of incoming data. To apply topic model to AIS data, PQk-means vector quantization to convert AIS data record to code documents is introduced. Then, a topic model is applied to extract course patterns from AIS data. In fact, courses, not only encompasses trajectory locations, but also headings and speeds, are recognized by the proposed algorithm.

Organizations started accelerating project schedules and challenging the V-model typically used in space product development. The need of a faster and more adaptive response to changing customer needs within an improved development productivity made Agile process a potential key enabler of New Space sector. On the other hand, space system projects are typically executed in multi-party consortia. Each organization in a consortium adopts its own product development process and interprets “New Space” differently. For this reason, the implementation of Agile is not seamless as it requires coordination with traditional systems engineering approaches. This setup is what we refer to as “hybrid Agile product development process”. This paper provides a first definition of the architecture of hybrid product development process targeted toward systems development and lifecycle management of hardware projects developed by multi-party consortia. We consider this discussion in the context of the development of spaceflight hardware in the New Space industry.

In this context the adoption of the Community of Practice (CoP) model can enhance the learning process. Although existing web portals provide STEM educational material and teamwork tools to active members they fall short to support state of the art trends in science education. To advance STEM education a fusion of diverse tools like learning management systems, computer-supported collaborative learning, online CoP management and contemporary technological platforms (e.g. Internet of Things, mobile and pervasive computing technologies) is advocated.

1546,1546,The routing problems with optimization of the starting point: Dynamic programming Маршрутная задача с оптимизацией стартовой точки: динамическое программирование,"G. Chentsov, P.A. Chentsov.The extreme routing problem focused on engineering applications in mechanical engineering is considered. We mean the well-known task of tool controlling in the CNC sheet cutting machines. A mathematical model is presented which includes a system of megalopolises (nonempty finite sets) and cost functions depending on the list of tasks. Megalopolises are constructed on the basis of discretization of equidistant curves of part contours. The dependence on the list of tasks is connected with reasons associated with the dynamic constraints that arise in the process of task completion. Among all restrictions, the conditions of precedence are distinguished (earlier cutting of the inner contours and more earlier cutting of large parts). Rational consideration of the precedence conditions allows one to reduce the complexity of calculations when widely understood dynamic programming (DP) is used in the implementation that develops R. Bellman’s scheme. This approach makes it possible to solve the problem of optimizing complexes, which include the initial state (starting point), the method of numbering megalopolises in the order of their visits, and the specific trajectory of the process. For a problem complicated by the dependence of the terminal function on the initial state, a decomposition algorithm is used, which allows, in a substantial part of the procedure, the application of a single (for all initial states) DP scheme. The optimal algorithm based on DP is implemented as a program for PC; a computational experiment is conducted.",60103702,Ural Federal University,Yekaterinburg,Russian Federation,['1703'],18.307692307692307,-0.09975649350649353,0.4388798701298702,1

To represent the room filters in the STFT domain, instead of the widely used narrowband assumption, the authors propose to use a more accurate model, i.e. the convolutive transfer function (CTF). At each frequency band, the CTF coefficients of the mixing filters and the STFT coefficients of the sources are jointly estimated by maximising the likelihood of the microphone signals, which is resolved by an expectation-maximisation algorithm.

Usually magnetically-induced birefringence is low owing to the low magnetic energy of molecules and to the averaging effect due to thermal agitation. At the same time, the response is usually very fast given the typical timescales of molecular orientational dynamics (nanoseconds). However, we show that the dibutyl phosphate/propylamine liquid mixture is characterized by an extremely slow response (hours) to the magnetic field and by an intense overall effect (∆n/λ ≈ −0.1m− 1 at 1 Tesla). This surprising behavior has been interpreted as a manifestation of a novel phenomenon of progressive building up of larger and larger internally ordered hetero-associates driven by the magnetic field and involving strongly interacting amphiphiles.",60021199,Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,Rome,Italy,['1700'],29.8,0.08758333333333333,0.41941666666666666,0

In the second verification stage, each of the emojis and non-emojis are classified by using proposed features with a decision tree classifier. Experiments were conducted to evaluate each stage independently and assess the performance of the proposed algorithm completely by using a self-collected dataset. The results showed that the proposed RGB-channel analysis method achieved better performance than the Niblack and Sauvola methods.

The electrical conductivity of the fluid is determined depending on the concentration of the electrolyte and, accordingly, the electrostatic field that occurs when the fluid flows. The effect of the electrostatic field on the bubble formation dynamics has shown that the radius of the gas bubbles and the dynamics of its expansion, formed by the pressure difference, can be regulated by the potential difference parameter.

This paper discusses a method of classifying paintings into two art movements, namely Cubism and Romanticism, using two texture descriptors: Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The paper also extends the applicability of the method to different classifiers. Some classifiers used for classification are KNN, NuSVC, LinearSVC, GaussNB, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost and Gradient Boost. A subset of the Pandora database is used as a dataset. From the results, it can be inferred that using the Gradient Boost classifier gives the highest overall accuracy for Cubism and Romanticism when LBP and HOG are used as texture descriptors. Moreover, it can be seen that LBP emerges as the best feature for classifying paintings into the Cubism and Romanticism Art Movements.",60109348,"Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani – Dubai Campus",Dubai,United Arab Emirates,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",19.555555555555557,0.16666666666666666,0.3166666666666667,1
1559,1559,Wearable sensors to characterize the autonomic nervous system correlates of food-like odors perception: A pilot study," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: The sense of smell has been recently recognized as one of the most important sensory features in the human being, representing a reliable biomarker for a number of clinical conditions. The relationship between olfactory function and the person’s attitude towards food has frequently been investigated, often using questionnaires. The administration of minimally invasive methods for characterizing autonomic nervous system (ANS) functionality could help in objectivizing such measurements. Methods: The present study assessed ANS activation through the analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals, in response to olfactory stimuli using non-invasive wearable devices. The ANS activation was also studied with respect to the odor familiarity, as well as with other olfactory and food dimensions (e.g., odor identification, odor pleasantness, food neophobia). Results: We demonstrated a significant activation of the ANS, in particular of its sympathetic branch, during the olfactory stimulation, with the ECG signal seen as more sensitive to detect ANS response to moderate olfactory stimuli rather than the GSR. Conclusions: When applied to a greater number of subjects, or to specific groups of patients, this methodology could represent a promising, reliable addition to diagnostic methods currently used in clinical settings.",60028868,Università di Pisa,Pisa,Italy,"['1711', '1708', '1705']",28.428571428571427,0.16403508771929826,0.4978070175438597,0

In this work, we propose a generic approach called Human Importance-aware Network Tuning (HINT) that effectively leverages human demonstrations to improve visual grounding. HINT encourages deep networks to be sensitive to the same input regions as humans. Our approach optimizes the alignment between human attention maps and gradient-based network importances - ensuring that models learn not just to look at but rather rely on visual concepts that humans found relevant for a task when making predictions. We apply HINT to Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning tasks, outperforming top approaches on splits that penalize over-reliance on language priors (VQA-CP and robust captioning) using human attention demonstrations for just 6% of the training data.",60019647,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,United States,"['1712', '1707']",28.4,0.08947368421052632,0.26973684210526316,1

The obtained method makes it possible to effectively generate the rule bases with the optimal consequents for the Mamdani-type fuzzy systems in the following cases: at insufficient amount of initial information (under conditions of a high degree of information uncertainty); at a sufficiently large number of rules for which the development of a rule base based on the knowledge of experts is not always effective; at different levels of experts qualification. The study of the effectiveness of the proposed method in this work is carried out at the development of the rule base of the Mamdani-type fuzzy controller for the automatic control system of the reactor temperature of the specialized pyrolysis complex, that is intended for utilization of polymer waste. At the same time, the generation of the consequents of the rule base of this fuzzy controller was carried out with various adjustable parameters of the method, such as the total number of agents and the number of elite agents in the population. Based on the analysis of the results of the conducted experiments, the optimal configuration of the population of agents of the method was determined, for which the optimal vector of the consequents of the rule base can be found at the lowest computational and time costs. Also, the results of computer simulations of transients showed that the automatic temperature control system with the developed fuzzy controller rule base based on the proposed by the authors method with the optimal configuration of parameters has a significantly lower value of the objective function and higher control quality parameters than the system with the rule base on the basis of experts knowledge, which, in turn, confirms the high efficiency of this method.",60087519,Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University,Mykolaiv,Ukraine,"['1712', '1710']",52.666666666666664,-0.11362857142857141,0.5943428571428572,1

Kaliwlingi, a coastal village in Brebes, lies on the estuary of Pemali River in the north of Java Island, Indonesia. Disaster preparedness and climate change mitigation are one of the five aspects factored in coastal disaster resilience assessment at the village level. This quantitative research was designed to determine the coastal community resilience in Kaliwlingi by analyzing disaster preparedness and climate change mitigation. The variables were grouped into infrastructure and non-infrastructure. While the former consists of early warning systems and physical infrastructure, the latter includes government responsibility and regulations on disaster preparedness. The questionnaire items were encoded to the Likert scale, and then the data were analyzed to understand how the community perceived the prevailing disaster and climate change preparedness. The results showed that the community had substantial knowledge of emergency food stockpiles and proper recognition on shoreline structures and early warning system but poor comprehension of available shelter, emergency actions by the local government, and disaster preparedness. Based on these indicators, this community was concluded as moderately resilient. Also, gender seemed to be the strongest determinant of resilience index.

Global rice production and consumption involve more than 250 million farmers and 3.3 billion consumers, respectively. The most common pest that frequently attacks rice is brown planthopper or BPH (Nilaparvata lugens Stal). The objective of this study was to estimate area infested by BPH by using satellite spectral data analysis. The methods consisted of five stages, i.e. data preparation, field checking, determination of planting dates, Vegetation Index (VI) analysis, and estimation of infested area. Data preparation included data downloading and projecting, image cropping and digitizing. Field checking was carried out to validate the data and to get historical data of BPH infestation. The planting dates were determined by investigating the annual pattern of VI and rice plant development. VI analysis was using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). Estimation of infested area consisted of 4 procedures i.e. data normalization, Vegetation Index Unit (VIU) calculation, infested area estimation, and comparison of NDVI-EVI value. This study indicated that satellite spectral data analysis could be used to estimate the area infested by BPH.

1586,1586,Reliable real-time ball tracking for robot table tennis,"Robot table tennis systems require a vision system that can track the ball position with low latency and high sampling rate. Altering the ball to simplify the tracking using, for instance, infrared coating changes the physics of the ball trajectory. As a result, table tennis systems use custom tracking systems to track the ball based on heuristic algorithms respecting the real-time constrains applied to RGB images captured with a set of cameras. However, these heuristic algorithms often report erroneous ball positions, and the table tennis policies typically need to incorporate additional heuristics to detect and possibly correct outliers. In this paper, we propose a vision system for object detection and tracking that focuses on reliability while providing real-time performance. Our assumption is that by using multiple cameras, we can find and discard the errors obtained in the object detection phase by checking for consistency with the positions reported by other cameras. We provide an open source implementation of the proposed tracking system to simplify future research in robot table tennis or related tracking applications with strong real-time requirements. We evaluate the proposed system thoroughly in simulation and in the real system, outperforming previous work. Furthermore, we show that the accuracy and robustness of the proposed system increases as more cameras are added. Finally, we evaluate the table tennis playing performance of an existing method in the real robot using the proposed vision system. We measure a slight increase in performance compared to a previous vision system even after removing all the heuristics previously present to filter out erroneous ball observations.",60030569,Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems,Tubingen,Germany,['1702'],23.636363636363637,-0.014916666666666656,0.4136666666666667,1

1589,1589,A critical review of research on language learning strategies used by Arab learners of English," All Rights Reserved.More than four decades have passed since the language learning strategy (LLS) concept was first brought to wide attention by Joan Rubin (1975). Although LLS research is prolific, it has faced challenges regarding its conceptual and methodological nature. These apparent weaknesses have encouraged some proponents of LLS research (e.g. Oxford, 2011; Rose et al, 2018) to conduct a systematic review of previous LLS research, with the aim of identifying the nature of the vigorous attempts to abandon the construct of LLS in research studies. Surprisingly, perhaps, these reviews did not include any LLS research studies concerning Arab learners. Therefore, this paper examines previous research into the LLSs used by Arab learners of English taken from different databases. The analysis has indicated that the majority (22 out of 27) of studies discovered were exclusively quantitative, using Oxford’s (1990) Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL). These quantitative studies correlated the Arab participants’ LLS use with other individual learner variables, especially those related to gender and language proficiency. The other five were qualitative studies, and no study had adopted a mixed-method approach.

1592,1592,"Ecological restoration planning based on multi-criteria approach in landscape of South Tapanuli Regency, Indonesia","Deforestation is one of the largest issues in Indonesian forests. Between 2001 and 2017, South Tapanuli, one of regency in North Sumatera Province, Indonesia, experienced the largest forest loss in 2011. One of the best way to improve the quality of deforested landscape is ecological restoration. In order to get the comprehensive understanding for landscape restoration planning, identifying the Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) should be considered. This study aimed to provide a foundation to support new decision-making tools for policymakers to plan the ecological restoration for South Tapanuli. Multi criteria approach combined with participatory planning of local stakeholders were applied for developing criteria. The criteria were selected based on biophysical characters derived from regulations and were converted into boolean map. Then, ESA model was obtained from overlaid of those boolean map which is identified the level of sensitivity area including level 1 (highest), 2, 3, and 4 (lowest). Sensitivity level 1 were dominated in Muara Batang Toru, Batang Toru, Angkola Selatan, and Angkola Sangkunur consisted of 5,340.78 ha (25,14%); 3,129.07 ha (14,73%); 2,911.29 ha (13,7%); and 2,708.51 ha (12,75%), respectively.

1593,1593,A model free control algorithm based on the sliding mode control method with applications to unmanned aircraft systems,"Control methods require the use of a system model for the design and tuning of the controllers in meeting and/or exceeding the control system performance objectives. However, system models contain errors and uncertainties that also may be complex to develop and to generalize for a large class of systems such as those for unmanned aircraft systems. In particular, the sliding control method is a superior robust nonlinear control approach due to the direct handling of nonlinearities and uncertainties that can be used in tracking problems for unmanned aircraft system. However, the derivation of the sliding mode control law is tedious since a unique and distinct control law needs to be derived for every individual system and cannot be applied to general systems that may encompass all classifications of unmanned aircraft systems. In this paper, a model-free control algorithm based on the sliding mode control method is developed and generalized for all classes of unmanned aircraft systems used in robust tracking control applications. The model-free control algorithm is derived with knowledge of the system's order, state measurements, and control input gain matrix shape and bounds and is not dependent on a mathematical system model. The derived control law is tested using a high-fidelity simulation of a quadrotortype unmanned aircraft system and the results are compared to a traditional PID controller for tracking performance and power consumption. Realistic type hardware inputs from joysticks and IMUs was simulated for the analysis. Finally, the model-free control algorithm was implemented on a quadrotor-type unmanned aircraft system testbed used in real flight experimental testing. The experimental tracking performance and power consumption was analysed and compared to a traditional PID-type controller.",60001777,Rochester Institute of Technology,Rochester,United States,['1702'],27.4,0.07845804988662132,0.5128684807256236,1

The deep belief network is applied to extract features between status monitoring data and the performance degradation in different failure components. To calculate the path weight of failure propagation, the Bayesian structural equation model is proposed to study the relationship among different fault modes. After getting the performance degradation of each fault through DBN and calculating the path weight of fault propagation by BSEM, it is available to get the overall reliability of the system. The aircraft landing gear system with 19 fault patterns is selected to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed deep fusion model. The results demonstrate that the overall reliability of the system can be obtained by analysing the fault propagation of multiple fault patterns, and the proposed model has a lower deviation than traditional back propagation neural network.",60021666,Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Nanjing,China,['1706'],26.5,-0.036666666666666674,0.3233333333333333,0
1595,1595,Evaluation of Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) schemes in simulating heavy rainfall events over Central Java using high resolution WRF model,"A realistic realization of heavy rainfall in the mountainous region in Java is important for weather forecasts and climate simulations due to its potential disaster caused such as flashfloods and landslides. To study the relation between heavy rainfall events and such impacts, high resolution simulations are necessary to account for the appropriate representation of the geographical features and as well as the convection that typically occurred in such settings which lead to heavy rainfall events. The planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme in a numerical model is a sensitive aspect which may lead to very different results of the rainfall simulation in a mountainous region setting. While such study of the PBL are still quite rare, in this study high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations were carried out for different schemes of the PBL, i.e. Yonsei University (YSU) and Shin-Hong (SH) schemes, for a heavy rainfall event during 28 - 30 November 2018 over Central Java. The numerical model employs nesting with horizontal resolutions of 9 km, 3 km and 1 km for the outer, middle and inner domains, respectively. Some satellite observations, i.e. Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), CPC Morphing Technique (CMORPH) Global Precipitation Analyses, and Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), were used to compare with the model results. The results showed that the heavy rainfall simulated with the SH scheme was closer to both the TRMM and CMORPH dataset than simulation result with the YSU scheme, although both schemes resulted in a similar spatial rainfall pattern. The findings suggest that the SH scheme can be used at a kilometer resolution to adequately replicate the scale and evolution of the observed rolls in heavy rainfall events in the mountainous area with steep slopes.

The sample included 200 participants (146 males and 54 females) working as researchers in government scientific institutions with service experience ranging from two to 30 years. The participants were administered with standardised measures of obsolescence, work engagement, work motivation, resistance to change, organisational climate, human resource management (HRM) Policies and Practices, and Self Esteem. The obtained data were analysed with correlation and regression analyses. The findings revealed that in the target population obsolescence due to both organisational and individual level factors was found significantly and positively correlated with amotivation and resistance to change; whereas, negatively correlated with work engagement, organisational climate, HRM policies and practices, intrinsic motivation, and self-esteem. Regression analyses indicated that adequate recognition of efforts, better training and development, qualitative work availability (pressure), and enhanced concern to optimally maintain the intrinsic motivation and dedication of employees are significant factors for keeping check on obsolescence.

1609,1609,Interleaved Sketch: Toward Consistent Network Telemetry for Commodity Programmable Switches,"Network telemetry is vital to various network applications, including network anomaly detection, capacity planning, and congestion alleviation. State-of-the-art network telemetry systems are claimed to be scalable, flexible, all-purpose, and accurate. They adopt interval approaches that track network traffic in each interval and collect statistics for analysis at a specific epoch. However, interval methods are impaired by collecting inconsistency and clearing inconsistency, which pollute statistics. Moreover, The state-of-the-art centralized controllers have long latency, which aggravates the discrepancy. Accordingly, we propose the interleaved sketch, a consistent and decentralized network telemetry system across all switches. Each switch has two asymmetric sketches that work in an interleaved fashion, and is self-supervised to improve consistency. The distributed control plane extracts the flow characteristics and provides network-wide telemetry with low latency. We build a P4 prototype of our proposed interleaved sketch and test it on a Barefoot Tofino switch. Experimental results demonstrate that our interleaved sketch achieves ideal accuracy at line speed, with 6% resource overhead.",60024350,National University of Defense Technology,Changsha,China,['1700'],16.0,0.1888888888888889,0.4453703703703703,1

Moreover, the ambiguity and precision error are common in handwritten words. In addition, among the huge amount of complex shaped characters, some are very similar in shape those possess severe difficulty to recognize handwritten Bengali characters. Bearing in mind the complexity of the problem, an efficient approach for recognizing handwritten Bengali alphabet is proposed in this work. This proposed approach for identifying Bengali characters is based on character geometry-oriented feature extraction for different handwritten characters. In this paper, different image processing steps are used including image acquisition, digitization, preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction for tackling the difficulty. Most importantly, the geometry based feature extraction method has been employed to extract the effective features from the Bengali characters for the classification purposes. Then, the classification result was measured for SVM and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based classifiers on self-generated training and testing data sets which contain 2500 different samples of 50 characters in the Bengali character-set.

Since all primary level teachers must teach Irish, becoming a primary teacher in Ireland is bound up in complex ways with the process of becoming a teacher of a minority language and with personal attitudes to, and views on, the language itself. The current study analyses similarities and differences in views relating to teachers’ role in promoting the language, as well as issues in proficiency in the language, at the beginning and end of initial teacher education. Also examined is the extent to which above-average self-reported proficiency in Irish influences the experience of teaching Irish. Data is derived from responses to closed and supplementary open-ended questionnaire items administered to two different groups of pre-service teachers: at the beginning (n=75) and the end of initial teacher education (n=91), and is supplemented with data from interviews conducted with a subgroup of Group 2 (n=30).

These devices demonstrated drastic improvements in performance in the past several years and can produce broadband and narrow-linewidth single-mode terahertz emission with power output sufficient for spectroscopic applications. Recent efforts in the wavefunction engineering using an active region design based on a dual-upper-state concept led to a significant enhancement of the optical nonlinearity of the active region for efficient terahertz generation. Dual-upper-state terahertz quantum cascade laser sources exhibit the power of >0.3 mW. Here, we report low frequency generation from terahertz quantum cascade laser sources based on intra-cavity nonlinear frequency mixing.

1617,1617,Reliable integrated satellite/terrestrial communications using mimo for mitigation of microwave absorption by earth’s oxygen," But as microwaves pass through the Earth’s atmosphere, the oxygen gas absorbs microwave. In this 5G era, when the whole world is moving towards high data-rates and reliable communications, this absorption affects the data transmission in integrated satellite/terrestrial communication (ISTC) systems, which leads to degradation of the system performance. However, the superior data-rates and better transmission reliability requirements of modern and future (5G and beyond) practical wireless communication systems may easily be acquired by using the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) techniques. The authors investigate MIMO diversity results by considering the effect of varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value on key performance indicators block error rate (BLER), throughput and error vector magnitude (EVM).

DRDO driven R&D efforts have catalysed the growth of domestic defence and civilian industries in the country as well. The overarching endeavours of DRDO encompassing academia, private industry and Defence PSUs have helped in establishing a self-reliant defence industrial ecosystem and collectively all have contributed in the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of “skill development” and “Make-in-India”.

1622,1622,Terahertz wave transmission and reflection characteristics in plasma,"After entering the near space, a layer of plasma sheath is formed outside the hypersonic vehicles due to the hightemperature and high-pressure environment. The plasma sheath, which characteristic frequency is similar to microwave, will cause serious impediment to communication signal. This phenomenon is known as the blackout problem. With the rapid development of aerospace industry, plasma sheath blackout has become an urgent problem to be solved. Current research shows that increasing the frequency of electromagnetic wave higher than the plasma characteristic frequency can effectively reduce the shielding effect of plasma. The frequency of terahertz (THz) wave is much higher than microwave, it can propagate through plasma sheath, which provides an effective method to solve the problem of plasma sheath. In this paper, a theoretical model of plasma is established, and the transmission properties of THz wave in plasma is simulated using scattering matrix method. Then a kind of plasma jet is produced in laboratory environment according to dielectric barrier discharge. And the experiments of a broadband THz source and THz time-domain spectrum transmission in this kind of plasma and a 2.52 THz wave reflection imaging of target under plasma shelter are carried out respectively. The transmittance increases with frequency under 0.5 THz and becomes stable at 100% over 0.5 THz, and the result of experiments and simulation are in good agreement.

Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), spectral reflectance short-wave band (SWIR), were used from satellite data derived from Landsat 8-OLI/TIRS data.

In this study, we demonstrated a highly sensitive detection method of glycerol-water solutions using terahertz metamaterials fabricated on silicon substrate with metal arrays of the asymmetric double split-ring resonator structure. We measured the transmitted spectra of the metamaterial to detect the water-glycerol solutions at different concentrations by the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system. With the increasing of glycerol concentration, resonant dips of metamaterial exhibit the blue-shift phenomena and transmittance at the resonance frequency simultaneously enhance. The movement of resonant dips and the change of transmittance shows that these resonators are sensitive to the variation of glycerol concentration. The finite-difference time-domain simulation agree well with the experimental data, and the simulation of surface current and electric field distribution at resonance dips can further understand the resonance modes in transmission spectra.

Besides, the infrared spectral features provide a rare opportunity to discover the exceedingly-evident redshifts of symmetric stretching modes (Symst) in water on forming H-bond, in contrast to the slightly-redshifted asymmetric stretching modes (Asyst) in water. To explain these intriguing behaviors, we further analyzed the nuclear vibrating patterns, which clearly reveal that H-bond retains two unexpected effects on nuclear motions in water: (i) Intensifying donor Symst, and (ii) Inhibiting donor Asyst. Furthermore, we also quantified the impact of anharmonic quantum fluctuations on each hydrogen bond. For the stretching modes involved in H-bonds, red shifts up to more than one hundred wave numbers are observed under anharmonic vibration, explicitly indicating the increased 'covalency' of H-bonds.

1628,1628,Satellite-derived bathymetry to improve bathymetric map of Indonesia,"Satellite imagery along with image processing techniques are essential tools for bathymetry retrieval since they are relatively inexpensive in term of time and budget in comparison to the conventional bathymetry survey. Approximately, 1126 bathymetric maps in various scales were produced by Badan Informasi Geospasial (BIG) covering Indonesia's oceans and coastal waters. Those maps actually only cover 24,9% of total maps required to cover all Indonesia waters. Moreover, gaps in survey data, particularly in shallow water area, are also problematic. Only 12% of Indonesia's waters are covered by a detailed survey. Hence, BIG is exploring remote sensing techniques to help with the improvement of Indonesia's bathymetric maps including Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB). SDB is promising due to its ability to fill the gap of depths derived from conventional hydrographic surveys. This is important for BIG since achieving wide-area depth coverage via the hydrographic surveys is costly in terms of time and money including for the safety of surveyors. This paper focuses on modelling bathymetry from multispectral images along Tanjung Kelayang, Tanjung Priok and Cilamaya shallow water area, Indonesia. A nonlinear machine learning technique was used to derive shallow water bathymetry by combining single beam echosounding measurements and the reflectance of red, green, blue, and near infrared bands of remotely sensed imagery. SVM can work better in a clear water area, for i.e. Tanjung Kelayang with RMSE less than 0.6. Furthermore, higher accuracies were obtained at depth range 0-5 m and 10-15 m for Tanjung Kelayang and Tanjung Priok, respectively. Highest accuracy was given in the depth range 0-5 m when applying SVM using four bands, but when using only three bands lowest RMSE value was obtained in the depth range of 5-10 m. SVM are able to estimate depth information in the shallow water area, especially in the water depth of <6 m (for i.e., Tanjung Kelayang and Cilamaya). However, the SDB results are noisy in the deeper water area >6 m. The inclusion of NIR band to the datasets results in a better accuracy. From results, we can see a correlation between the accuracy of bathymetric model and water clarity. High turbidity impacted the sensitivity of the depth algorithm.

1632,1632,Paddy and non-paddy crops mapping using multioral data of Sentinel-1A in part of Bantul Regency,"Monitoring of rice field, as a place for producing rice is very important to realize one aspect of food security, namely food availability. Modern agriculture has been widely utilize remote sensing data, especially optical images for monitoring agricultural land in various aspects of land management. However, the use of optical images is hampered by cloud cover when monitoring rice fields because most of them located in tropical countries, so there is an alternative to using SAR imagery that has ability to penetrate clouds. One of the SAR image products is Sentinel-1A with band C on its sensors which was launched in 2014 and the data can be utilized by the wider community for free. The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of multitemporal Sentinel-1A SAR imagery in identifying paddy and non-paddy in Bantul Regency's agriculture field which was measured through its mapping accuracy. Sentinel-1A multioral images with ten recording dates from February to May 2018 were used as the main data for this study. The method used is a digital classification with two approaches i.e. parametric with MLC algorithm and non-parametric with k-NN algorithm. In addition, the Sentinel-1A, which consists of VV and VH polarization, performed in three classification schemes (VV multioral, VH multioral, and VV and VH multioral). The classification results show that multioral Sentinel-1A can be used to identify paddy and non-paddy fields with an accuracy of 77.69% (VV multitemporal-MLC), 82.15% (VH multioral-MLC), 88.45% (VV and VH multioral-MLC), 76.64% (VV multitemporal-kNN), 78.47% (VH multioral-kNN) and 79.52% (VV and VH multioral-kNN).",60069380,Universitas Gadjah Mada,Yogyakarta,Indonesia,['1706'],25.5,0.14424242424242426,0.4575757575757576,1

As a follow up to the declaration, the implementation of development in West Papua should refer to the following principles i.e. environmental protection, preservation of biodiversity, management of utilization of natural resources wisely and sustainably, and recovery of the livelihoods and management of important ecosystem that have been degraded. Identifying Environmental Sensitive Area (ESA) should be considered as one of the first steps to realize spatial planning for a conservation province that must prioritize protection zones. Multi criteria approach combined with participatory planning of multi stakeholders were applied for developing criteria. The criteria were selected based on biophysical aspects derived from regulation (Presidential Decree 32/1990 on Protected Areas Management) and were converted into boolean map. Then, landscape models were obtained from overlaid of those boolean map which identified the degree of sensitivity including highly, moderately, and slightly. All three ESA models produce varying percentages of highly sensitive areas at 82.80%; 59.12%; and 32.21% for ESA model-1, model-2, model-3, respectively. Although varied, but found the same three regencies dominated by highly sensitive areas namely the Teluk Bintuni, Kaimana, and Tambrauw regencies.

The parafin-embedded breast tissue samples were adopted in this study and identified as tumor (226 samples), healthy fibrous tissue (233 samples) or adipose tissue (178 samples) based on the histological results. Firstly, the THz pulsed signals of tissue samples were acquired using a standard transmission THz time-domain spectrometer. Then, the signals were decomposed by the wavelet packet transform (WPT) and the features of the WPE were extracted. To reduce the dimensionality of extracted features, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was employed. Six different machine learning classifiers were then performed and compared for automatic classification of different tissue samples. The highest classification accuracy is up to 97% using the fine Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) approach.

Remote sensing technology is able to provide information on LST over a large area so that it can be used to assess the effect of land-cover characteristic of mining-affected landscape on LST. This research used Landsat 8 images to study the relationships between land-use and LST in a coal-mined landscape of a mining company in South Kalimantan. Specifically, this study aimed to examine the effect of different planting years of reclaimed forest on LST and to examine the effect of different dominant tree species of reclaimed forest on LST. Data source for LST calculation was band 10 of Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) from recording years of 2014 and 2018. The images analysis consisted of the following steps: LST data extraction using Avdan and Jovanovska (2016) algorithm, land surface emissivity calculation following Valor and Caselles (1996), and overlay of LST maps with land-cover maps. A field work to measure stand characteristics of reclaimed forests was also conducted. The result shows that reclaimed forests with different planting years tends to have similar temperature-decreasing ability. This is shown by similar average LST values of reclaimed forest stands planted at year 1997, 2014, 2015, and 2016, which were around 27°C at year 2018. Meanwhile, reclaimed forest stands with different dominant trees species and total basal area also tend to similar temperature decreasing ability, being around 4.7-5.7°C after 3-4 years of planting.

Sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite are two very important salts in people's lives. Sodium nitrate is usually used as quick-acting fertilizer in acidic soil, but excessive use will cause certain pollution to the environment. If sodium nitrate is heated, it becomes very stable sodium nitrite, which is usually added to food as a preservative and colorant, but excessive consumption of nitrite can lead to food poisoning and even death. Therefore, it is necessary to detect sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite. Based on THz-TDS system, the spectral characteristics of sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite in 0.1-1 THz band were studied.

1656,1656,Adapting a checklist of materials evaluation for a self-access learning center in Japan," All Rights Reserved.Materials evaluation calls for a systematic and principled approach. In reality, however, materials evaluation in language-learning self-access centers (SACs) is significantly lacking in good models. This paper reports on a project undertaken by SAC facilitators in Japan to investigate whether/how a pre-evaluation checklist developed a decade ago at a SAC in New Zealand (c.f. Reinders & Lewis, 2006) could be adapted to their target context. A mixed methods approach was employed where data was obtained via a Likert-scale questionnaire and follow-up interviews. The survey was adapted from Reinders and Lewis and enrolled 103 Japanese university students. The interviews were conducted to eight randomly selected survey respondents. Results show that the modeled checklist can be used as a basis with modifications allowing for contextual differences. The results suggest that Japanese learners of English value visually stimulating materials and require more guided support for them to effectively use materials beyond the classroom.

1657,1657,Design and selection criteria of main parachute for re-entry space payload," The selection of the main parachute is the most critical and important part of the space module recovery system. Parachute size is restricted by the required landing speed, materials, and weight of the payload. Parachute materials are selected based on the various forces experienced by the parachute. An investigation has been carried out to design a parachute system which gives less impact velocity, less angle of oscillation and less impact load for the landing of a crew module. Therefore, in this paper, selection criteria for the main parachute have been discussed considering recovery of re-entry space payload of 500 kg (unmanned) and 3500 kg (manned) class. Based on analysis carried out on the parachute size, canopy filling time, velocity reduction, peak deceleration, and opening shock, authors have proposed a unique type of solid canopy with slots (slots of the minimum area equivalent to geometry porosity) for the main parachute rather than a complex ringsail or disk-band type canopy. With this new concept, the parachute has been designed, developed and qualified through testing, trials and maiden flight of space capsule in LEO and is propose to use in the next manned space mission program.",60019106,Indian Institute of Technology Banaras Hindu University,Varanasi,India,['1706'],27.714285714285715,0.11831550802139036,0.4208556149732619,0
1658,1658,Estimation of aboveground biomass in urban forest area using SPOT 7 imageries in Tangerang City,"The national law in Indonesia stated that cities are required to have 30% of green open space from the total area. Tangerang City is one of the capital's buffer cities that has been continuously grown since the 1990s. The development of the city is quite rapid, and the emergence of various activities such as household activities, transportation, and industry are encouraging changes in green open space areas. Data from the regional statistic shows that open green space in Tangerang City is only 12.56% (2,319.21 hectares) of the total area. The less open green space area might degrade its main function as an absorber of emissions or pollutants, especially for carbon dioxide gas (CO2). This study aims to estimate the biomass, total CO2 stored by vegetation. This study uses direct measurements and vegetation index to formulate the ideal biomass formula. The pre-field activities begin with the extraction of NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) from SPOT 7 imageries. The biomass allometric formulas used in this study are the Brown and Lugo equation, to find biomass values from tree stand parameters such as diameter breast height (DBH) and tree height.

Karawang regency is part of the region in the Jakarta-Bandung mega-urban corridor. Vegetated lands in Karawang Regency are threatened by land conversion as a result of the Jakarta-Bandung conurbation process which tends to trigger the formation of the Jakarta-Bandung Mega-Urban Region. The increasing population in Karawang Regency has increasingly triggered the conversion of vegetated lands into built-up lands so that it can cause the region to be prone to anthropogenic disasters such as flood because of water catchment areas that reduced. The aims of this study are to analyze the land cover changes that occured in Karawang Regency in 2005-2015 and 2015-2025 and mapping the floodprone areas in Karawang Regency. Land cover changes analysis is carried out by overlapping Landsat Imagery of land cover in the 2005 and 2015 and 2015 and 2025 based on projection results using CA-Markov method.

At present, the terahertz plasmonic metamaterials (TPMMs) are an especially attractive application for biosensing owing to their sharp resonances respond. Compared with traditional biosensors, such as flow cytomertry, the TPMMs biosensors have many unique advantages, containing real-time monitoring, free label and high sensitivity. In this paper, we proposed a TPMMs which is designed by digging out periodically arranged regular hexagonal holes on the metal plate with the thickness of 200 nm.

1666,1666,Graceful degradation: An airborne surveillance radar perspective," Such radars use miniaturised transmit-receive (TR) modules and a failure of few modules does not lead to failure of the mission. For example, in AESA-based ground MTI radar, failure of a few modules does not affect the array performance. In such a case, the static ground clutter is centred on zero frequency does not have a motion dependent Doppler spread. However, in airborne AESA radars, the ground clutter has an angle dependent Doppler frequency due to the platform motion and clutter leaking in through antenna side-lobes. Hence, the antenna side lobe levels dictate the side lobe clutter against which target detection is to be performed. The detection performance is governed by the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). For Airborne surveillance radar the effect of random and systematic failures of TR modules and their effect on SINR is characterised. It is shown that single channel processing does not effectively provide the graceful degradation feature as the SINR loss due to failures is significant. However, the effect of systematic failure on SINR loss is less as compared to random failures.

1668,1668,Why do people use digital applications? a qualitative analysis of usage goals and psychological need fulfillment,"For many people, digital applications, especially messengers, social networks and cloud services, have become an important part of their daily life. Although most users express privacy concerns regarding the use of digital applications, their concerns do not prevent users from sharing personal information with such applications. A reason for this seemingly paradoxical behavior could be that users pursue certain goals when they are using these applications, which possibly overweigh their privacy concerns. We thus conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 users, with most of them being psychology students, to investigate why they use digital applications (i. e., messengers, social networks, cloud services, digital assistants, and Smart TVs) and what psychological needs they aim to fulfill by using these applications. Our study further included a card sorting task, in which the participants ranked the relevance of ten psychological needs for each of the investigated digital applications they reported to use. Using open coding for the analysis of the interview questions, and a quantitative analysis of the card sorting task, we identified four main psychological needs people aim to fulfill by using digital applications: (1) relatedness-belongingness, (2) competence-effectance, (3) pleasure-stimulation, and (4) autonomy-independence, and four additional psychological needs which are application-specific: (5) security, (6) popularity-influence, (7) self-actualization-meaning, and (8) money-luxury. Besides this, we identified several concerns (e. g., data abuse, privacy invasion, and eavesdropping) and reasons why people refrain from using certain digital applications (i. e., the lack of benefits, malfunction, high costs, and the fear of being eavesdropped on). The fulfillment of the psychological needs seem to overweigh those privacy concerns and play a major role for people's intention to use digital applications, which is why users will not use alternative privacy friendly applications if these do not allow for the fulfillment of those needs in the same way established applications do.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,"['1710', '1709', '1705']",27.272727272727273,0.06086385836385835,0.35172771672771663,1

GEOBIA has been utilized for many remote sensing applications with various degree of success. However, from the literature, its application for landform analysis and classification is still rare. This study aims to test GEOBIA interpretation capabilities to identify landform in part of Opak Watershed (Central Java, Indonesia) using Landsat 8 OLI and DEMNAS imagery (30 and 8- meters pixel size, respectively) and evaluate the result. Both image data were fused to create an image with high spectral and spatial resolution and contains elevation data, as an input for the segmentation process. GEOBIA interpretation process was performed gradually; first, initial Multiresolution Segmentation Algorithm was conducted to identify the variation of slope found in the study site. Then, the slope segments/objects were used to identify landform using Ruleset-Based Classification considering the image object information including object values, pattern, shape, and other parameters. The accuracy of the result was evaluated based on the percentage accuracy of the landform classification. From this study, we found that fusion-image and GEOBIA are capable of distinguishing landform elements very well with the percentage of overall accuracy is 88%.

One area that has been known as a source of internal wave generation is the Lombok Strait. The study of the internal wave characteristics in the Lombok Strait has been carried out using satellite data, radar sensor or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Although the internal wave parameter well extracted and described from SAR imagery, however, the information related to the frequency of occurrence and its temporal distribution remains unclear because of the limited spatial and temporal resolution of SAR data used in previous studies. The unprecedented availability of SAR C-band images provided by the Sentinel-1A constellation offers the opportunity to propose a new approach of internal wave occurrence frequency distribution in the Lombok Strait. In this work, 4-year consecutive period SAR images from Sentinel-1A satellite examined. Annual and monthly distribution of internal wave occurrence frequency in the Lombok Strait is discussed. It is found that the yearly distribution of SAR-observed internal wave occurrence frequencies varies each year with the maximum frequency of 33% in the year 2015, implying that large-scale processes changing the SAR observed internal wave occurrence.

1681,1681,Reversible THz modulation device based on VO2 phase transition,"In recent years, terahertz metamaterials have attracted great attention due to their widely application in frequency selector, filter, and other optical devices. Vanadium dioxide as the promising thermal memory material, has been used in making terahertz modulation device because of its well-known insulator-to-metal transition triggered by thermal, optical, and electrical. Here, we designed a composite metamaterial with three rings structure, where outer and inner rings are set to be ideal metallic gold and the middle ring is replaced by VO2. Using finite-difference time-domain method, we theoretically studied the variety of THz transmitted spectra during the insulator-to-metal transition of VO2 and its influence on the resonance coupling effect. When VO2 is in insulating phase, there are two resonant dips in spectrum. However, as VO2 undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition, the low-frequency resonance gradually moves to high frequency and finally splits into two. Our obtained results indicate the reversible terahertz modulation can be achieved by combining metamaterials with phase transition material.",60020256,Capital Normal University,Beijing,China,['1706'],22.571428571428573,0.14250000000000002,0.4547222222222222,1

However, videos captured by such systems suffer characterized Low Resolution (LR), varying illumination and pose challenges of subjects present in the videos. Consequently to manage these limitations, most existing Feature Extraction Techniques (FET) lack support for the limitations inherent in most VSS videos, which accounts for the high computational overhead and low accuracy of most video-based Face Recognition Systems. In this paper, Iterative Back Projection-Maximum A Posteriori (IBP-MAP) resolution reconstruction technique and an ensemble of local and global feature descriptors based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Gabor Wavelet Transform (GWT) were used to realize an improved pose and illumination invariant FET suitable for LR videos. 2900 LR frames were obtained from YouTube Celebrities corpus and a Locally Acquired Video Dataset (LAViD). These frames in the range of 30 pixels to 65 pixels were reconstructed using IBP-MAP. LDA-LBP-GWT ensemble was developed by fusing the facial features of Linear LDA, LBP and GWT into a LDA-LBP-GWT Single Feature Set (SFS). The SFS was dimensionally reduced using particle swarm optimization algorithm. The LR and the reconstructed frames were used as testing sets while locally acquired pose-oriented mugshots constituted the training set. Features of each frame in the testing sets were compared with those in the training set for recognition using Euclidean distance. The developed techniques were implemented in MATLAB 2019. The performance of the developed LDA-LBP-GWT ensemble was compared with the baseline techniques by using False Acceptance (FA), Recognition Accuracy (RA), Recognition Time (RT) and False Rejection (FR) as evaluation metrics.

The area is expected to function as buffer zone, yet local communities utilize this area for agricultural activities, which plays important role in their economics. Such condition creates high risk of erosion that could lead to decline in soil fertility as well as water quality of the pond and nearby streams. This study aimed to estimate the rate of soil loss in Situ Ciseupan area under the current land-use/cover (LU/LC) patterns and hypothetical LU/LC patterns for exploring the impact of land-use/cover conversion on soil loss. Soil loss rate is estimated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The study shows that average soil loss rate under the current LU/LC is 35.3 tons/ha/year. Areas classified as very high and severe erosion contributes 64.71% of the total soil loss. For simulating the impact of LU/LC conversion, we developed five scenarios in which the current LU/LC is converted into five hypothetical LU/LC types, each consists of a single type of LU/LC, i.e. bare soil, settlements, grassland, agriculture land, and forest. The simulation results show that if the current LU/LC is converted into 100 % of bare soil, settlement area, grassland, and agricultural field, the soil loss rate will increase by 1163%, 873%, 520%, and 317%, respectively. In contrast, the soil loss rate will decrease by 93%, if the current LU/LC is converted to 100% forest.",60069382,Institut Teknologi Bandung,Bandung,Indonesia,['1706'],22.181818181818183,0.03732857142857144,0.3753142857142857,1
1688,1688,A data confidentiality system based on trusted platform module in cloud storage environment," A number of methodologies and algorithms are available to prevent privacy vulnerabilities and achieve data security. Existing solutions to protect the data mainly rely on cryptographic techniques. However, these cryptographic techniques add computational overhead, in particular when the data is distributed among multiple Cloud Service Provider (CSP) servers and more precisely Key Management Servers (KMS). File Assured Deletion (FADE) is a promising solution for addressing this issue. FADE achieves assured deletion of files by making them unrecoverable to anybody, including those who manage the cloud storage. The system is built by encrypting all data files before outsourcing, and then using a trusted party to outsource the cryptographic keys. But, this methodology remains weak since its security relies completely on the security of the key manager. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that aims to improve the security of FADE by using the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and the Encrypted File System (EFS).

In the optimization theory, the conjugate gradient method is an efficient computational approach for solving the unconstrained optimization problem, specifically, for quadratic case. Since the linear optimal control problem consists of the quadratic cost function and the linear dynamical system, the practical application of the conjugate gradient method to this kind of problem would be addressed. In our study, the necessary conditions for optimality for the linear optimal control problem are highlighted. Then, the equivalent optimization problem is formulated and the gradient function, which is given by the stationary condition, is evaluated. On this basis, the search direction, which satisfies the conjugacy, is determined definitely. During the iterative procedure, the control sequence is calculated such that the state sequence could be obtained. Once the convergence is achieved, the optimal solution of the linear optimal control problem is obtained. For illustration, the optimal control of damped harmonic oscillator is discussed.

However, in the university where SW education centered on existing major was implemented, the curriculum, evaluation, and education system of SW education centering on the non-major is not yet structured. In this study, the curriculum was designed and systematically organized in the SW education of the non-majors, and the curriculum was created and used in the actual class. The main problem of the SW education of the non-major is that they have a preconceived notion that the SW education is difficult. Based on the previous study, the training should be preceded by a procedural listing of the non-major idea. We designed and taught curriculum based on block-based computing language. After that, we conducted a pre-post evaluation of motivation for learning by non-major. In addition, the algorithm training focused on sequential experience in problem solving and conducted pre-post evaluation. The results show that block-based computing languages have an effect on procedural listing of problem solving, comprehension of computing concepts, and expression of algorithms, but do not affect the choice of efficient algorithms.

In Indonesia, the beginning of rice planting time occurs at the beginning of the rainy season, but a high diversity of rainfall causes the beginning of rice planting to become varies in some areas. In the area that have a same rainfall, however, the beginning of planting time can be also vary due to the rotation of irrigation water distribution. Seeing this phenomenon, the beginning of planting time is very important to be identified, since it can be used to estimate when the harvest time comes and also the production.The purpose of this study were to identify the growth phase of rice crops based on reflectance and vegetation index using Sentinel-2A imageries and distribution of growth phase of rice crops. The research method begins with a transformation of digital numbers into reflectance values in order to correct the effect of a light source, sensor, atmospheric. Analysis of reflectance (NIR) and vegetation index (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) values were carried out on 56 samples spread over five phases of rice growth, i.e. wet fallow, vegetative, generative, harvesting, dry fallow. The results showed that the NDVI can distinguish five phases of rice growth more clearly than EVI, SAVI, NIR.

While there is an abundance of resources available to students online through online writing labs and online writing centers, most of these services only consist of reference materials with no option for advising or language teaching. Furthermore, the few universities that offer language learning services usually implement an asynchronous system through a delayed medium such as email. In this paper, we describe the implementation of online sessions at Osaka Unversity and highlight issues and opportunities for the future based on our experience and observations.",60024322,Osaka University,Suita,Japan,['1706'],26.2,0.03500000000000001,0.35750000000000004,0
1704,1704,Measuring the forest cover change in burned area using change vector analysis approach,"In 2015 the Jambi Province had been suffered from a big fire which destroying about 115.634 ha or 23% of the total area. This paper describes the measurement of the magnitude and direction of forest and land cover changes, especially in the burnt area of Harapan Rainforest, Jambi, occurred in 2015. The main objective of this study is to find out the magnitude as well as the direction of forest cover changes caused by fire. The magnitude and direction of changes were derived by using Change Vector Analysis (CVA) Approach on the basis of medium-resolution of Landsat 8 acquired in 2014 representing before fire condition and Landsat 8 recorded in 2016 representing after fire condition. The study shows that the magnitude of changes in the study site varied widely starting from slightly to heavily changes. The identified direction of the changes could be grouped into positive dan negative directions, where the negative directions include degradation (D1) and deforestation (D2), while the positive directions include regrowth (D3) and revegetation (D4). The area suffering from degradation and deforestation are 3540 ha and 3106 ha respectively, while the area experiencing vegetation the vegetation growth and revegetation are 55 ha and 227 ha. The study concludes that the CVA could be used to find out the magnitude and change direction (positive and negative) effectively.",60069381,IPB University,Bogor,Indonesia,['1706'],27.5,0.009280303030303028,0.41373106060606063,1
1705,1705,Establishment and relevant analysis of plant's spectral reflectivity database in visible and near-infrared bands,"The spectral reflectivity of the visible light bands of a non-self-illuminating object is one of the root causes of the colour formation of an object, and its uniqueness can be used to distinguish objects. Under low illumination conditions, the ability of the visible light image sensor to capture the colour of an object is greatly reduced. However, the object still has near-infrared radiation. The near-infrared radiation of the object collected by the near-infrared image sensor is combined with the visible light information of the object to improve the colour quality of the acquired object. Since the spectral reflectivity information of an object requires professional equipment to collect, it is inconvenient to use. Aim to more convenient use of spectral information data for colour restoration under low illumination conditions. In this paper, a plant's spectral reflectivity database in visible and near-infrared bands was proposed. Firstly, 50 plants samples such as ginkgo were collected from 400 nm to 1000 nm spectral reflectivity data by a full-bands hyperspectral sorter and processed by Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF). Secondly, according to the requirements of this database, the business process, function modules and architecture of the database are designed in detail. Finally, according to the design, use C# and SQL Server to establish the database.

However, any satellite that brings SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload requires much bigger energy storage compared to, for example, one that brings an optical payload for remote sensing mission. This paper addresses an energy balance analysis for microsatellite such that the remote sensing mission using SAR payload is successfully run. A specific LEO orbit, attitude of satellite, and position of solar panel are taken as a constraint in the simulation to obtain data used in potential solar power generated calculation.

1707,1707,310 GHz communication system based on direct spreading sequence,"With the advent of the 5G era, the demand for wireless communication rates is increasing, making high-speed wireless communication become a hot spot and focus. Due to the wider frequency bandwidth and good confidentiality, the terahertz band has attracted wide attention in the field of high-speed wireless communication above Gbps. However, terahertz wave is easily absorbed by water and attenuates seriously when it is transmitted in the atmosphere, which seriously restricts the development of communication in the terahertz band. However, the spread spectrum communication has attracted much attention in the field of terahertz communication because of its strong anti-fading, anti-interference and good confidentiality. In this paper, the simulation model of direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) communication system is established by using MATLAB, and the baseband signal and m-sequence spreading code of different rates are set, and 310GHz is used as the carrier frequency to transmit in additive white Gaussian noise channels with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 17dB to -1dB. Medium transmission, by checking the bit error rate (BER), to verify the anti-interference of the DSSS technology applied in the terahertz band. The simulation results show that when the spread spectrum gain is large, the DSSS can be used in terahertz communication under the same BER to transmit in channels with a SNR of 10dB worse. Therefore, the application of spread spectrum communication technology to terahertz communication has a good development scenario and will effectively promote the development of terahertz communication.",60020256,Capital Normal University,Beijing,China,['1706'],30.0,0.1529448621553885,0.5076441102756892,1

1710,1710,Study on transmission enhancement of air-adsorbed graphene by terahertz spectroscopy,"Graphene, made of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, has already attracted intense research and commercial interest in recent years. Early research focused on its remarkable electronic properties, such as the observation of massless Dirac fermions and the half-integer quantum Hall effect. Now graphene is finding application in touch-screen displays, as channels in high-frequency transistors and in graphene-based integrated circuits. The unique properties of graphene have also attracted various researches on carrier dynamics using THz spectroscopy. Here we present an experimental demonstration of monolayer CVD grown graphene via THz time-domain spectroscopy, as well as optical pump terahertz probe system. We observe that the maximum transmittance of the graphene is nearly 96% compared to the ambient signal. However, under the excitation of different optical pump fluences, it is found that unlike the semiconductor material, its transmitted amplitude is enhanced accordingly. We observed a wide-band modulation of the terahertz transmission at the range of 0.3-1.6 THz and a large modulation depth of 16.4% with a certain optical excitation. We attributed it to suppression of the air-adsorbed graphene photoconductivity due to an increase in the carrier scattering rate induced by the increase in the free-carrier concentration by photoexcitation. The obtained results not only highlight the influence of air conditions on how THz characterizations would guide the design and fabrication of graphene-based terahertz modulators and optoelectronic devices, but also show that graphene exhibits the potential for terahertz broadband transmission enhancement with photoexcitation.",60020256,Capital Normal University,Beijing,China,['1706'],23.9,0.11344537815126052,0.5338235294117647,1

The crab is a species that eats suspended material. Remote sensing can estimate the parameters of Total Suspended Solid (TSS). The purpose of this study was to estimate the distribution and test the accuracy of TSS concentrations in Lancang Island waters extracted from Landsat 8 OLI images by field observations. Statistical test indicators that can be used for accuracy tests include; root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and normalized mean absolute error (NMAE). The results of the RMSE value was 11.5 showed that the size of the error based on the difference between the value of the image and field data. The smaller the RMSE value, means the results of the model estimation produced was more precise with those observations. The MAE value of 1.774 showed the simplest form of error size. The MAE results indicated that it could be seen that the prediction error of the distribution of TSS was too small. It means the prediction of the distribution of TSS in this study had high accuracy. The NMAE of 31.9% shows the error rate that is normalized and expressed in percent (%). The NMAE value below 30% that could be used as proof of the validity of image data.

1713,1713,Comparing per-pixel and object-based classification results using two different land-cover/land-use classification schemes: A case study using Landsat-8 OLI imagery,"Development of satellite sensor systems capable of producing high spatial resolution digital images has led to the emergence of various alternative methods beside the more established per-pixel multispectral classifications. One alternative method is object-based image analysis (OBIA). At the beginning of its development, OBIA was primarily used for high spatial resolution images. However, the OBIA is now widely applied to images with medium- and even low-spatial resolutions. This study aimed to compare the effects of the OBIA and per-pixel classifications using using Landsat-8 OLI medium-spatial resolution image. Since the per-pixel classification relies solely on spectral aspects on various spectral bands, while the OBIA classification made use of spatial aspects as the main criteria, this study also made use of two land-cover/land-use classification schemes as references, i.e. spectral-oriented and spatial-oriented classification systems. The spectral-oriented classification scheme specifies categories from spectral perspective, i.e. pixel values in n-dimensional feature space; while the spatial-oriented one specifies categories with respect to their spatial characteristics. By using Kulon Progo region as a test area, the results showed that the OBIA classification was able to provide higher accuracy than that of per-pixel classification, both by referring to the spectral and spatial dimension classification schemes. The increase in accuracy provided by the OBIA classification proved to be greater when applied with a spatial dimension classification scheme, which was more than 10%, as compared to the improvement obtained by the spectral dimension classification scheme, i.e. 7%. This study also recommends the need for comparison studies using higher-spatial resolution imagery.",60069380,Universitas Gadjah Mada,Yogyakarta,Indonesia,['1706'],19.23076923076923,0.23119047619047617,0.4527380952380952,1
1714,1714,Bayesian Inference for Optimal Risk Hedging Strategy Using Put Options with Stock Liquidity,"This paper considers the problem of hedging the risk exposure to imperfectly liquid stock by investing in put options. In an incomplete market, we firstly obtain a closed-form pricing formula of the European put option with liquidity-adjustment by measure transformation. Then, an optimal hedging strategy which minimizes the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of the hedged portfolio is deduced by determining an optimal strike price for the put option. Furthermore, we provide a new perspective to estimate parameters entering the minimal VaR, since the likelihood function is analytically intractable. A Bayesian statistical method is proposed to perform posterior inference on the minimal VaR and the optimal strike price. Empirical results show that the risk hedging strategy with liquidity-adjustment differs from the hedging strategy based on Black-Scholes model. The effect of the stock liquidity on risk hedging strategy is significant.

This estimation of AGB from remote sensing data is now supported by the availability of the freely available dual-polarization Sentinel 1 SAR data. However, the assessment of the accuracy for measuring AGB from the VV and VH polarization in Sentinel-1 data in Indonesia is still limited. This study aims to assess the performance of VV and VH polarization and the combination with texture data from Sentinel-1 for estimating AGB in tropical forest of Barru Regency, South Sulawesi. The AGB was calculated by using backscatter value from C-band SAR dual-polarization and Grey Level of Measure (GLCM) texture data from Sentinel-1 as the independent variables, and ground inventory plots as the dependent variable. Twenty-three plots of field inventory data were collected whereas 16 plots were used in the regression models and the remaining seven plots were used to validate the result. The allometric equation was used to calculate the biomass value of the field survey data then multilinear regression models were generated by using biomass value, backscatter data from VV and VH polarization, and texture data. The performance of the resulted multilinear regression models was compared by looking at the coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE value using cross-validation. The results demonstrated that combination of VH and GLCM texture suggest as the best to estimate the AGB based on higher value of R2 = 0.44 and SE 83.7 kg/tree. In conclusion, VH polarization usage in vegetation AGB modelling has been able to predict 3 % higher than by using VV polarisation.

Therefore, many mathematical equations and algorithms have been developed and designed to estimate and determine the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration. Remote sensing data are one of the important sources and techniques to estimate spatial variation of various climate elements, including ET. The main objective of this research is to estimate the spatial variation of ET using the SEBAL algorithm and Landsat-8 imagery of a large-scale commercial oil palm plantation, i.e. PT Perkebunan Nusantara VI Batanghari, Jambi Province, Indonesia.

Contactless assessment of vasomotor reactivity in response to thermal exposure is currently not available. The aim of this study is to show the applicability of the imaging photoplethysmography (IPPG) method to measure quantitatively the vasomotor response to local thermal exposure. Seventeen healthy subjects aged 23 ± 7 years participated in the study. A warm transparent compress applied to subject's forehead served as a thermal impact. A custom-made IPPG system operating at green polarized light was used to monitor the subject's face continuously and simultaneously with skin temperature and electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. We found that the thermal impact leads to an increase in the amplitude of blood pulsations (BPA) simultaneously with the skin temperature increase. However, a multiple increase in BPA remained after the compress was removed, whereas the skin temperature returned to the baseline. Moreover, the BPA increase and duration of the vasomotor response was associated with the degree of external heating. Therefore, the IPPG method allows us to quantify the parameters of capillary blood flow during local thermal exposure to the skin.

1726,1726,On the interpretation of EOF analysis of the convectively coupled equatorial waves,"Convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEWs) are often identified by space-time filtering techniques via a fast-Fourier transformation (FFT) that make use of the eigenvalues (frequency and zonal wavenumber) derived from the linear shallow water theory. Here, instead, a method is presented for identifying CCEWs by using a combined FFT and empirical orthogonal function (EOF). We show that this technique is better at isolating CCEW's signals from noises and undesirable spectral mixtures among the modes. In particular, using lag-regression analysis, the structures associated with each eigenvector signal resemble equatorial wave features consistent with a linear wave theory. The first eight EOFs of the Kelvin-filtered outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) at the equator represent Kelvin waves with zonal wavenumbers 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The horizontal structures of MRG (n=0) and ER (n=1) waves are well isolated by only the first two EOFs, while the higher EOF modes capture spectral mixtures among the wave modes. On the other hand, the first ten EOF modes of Tropical Depression (TD)-type-filtered OLR anomalies represent TD-type wave activities across different regions; where the first four modes indicate TD-type wave activity over the South East China, while the modes of 5-6 and 9-10 indicate the TD-type wave activity over Africa and Central America, respectively. This study highlights the importance of the combined space-time FFT-EOFs analysis to better capture the horizontal structures of CCEWs that occur across a range of spatial scales.",60069381,IPB University,Bogor,Indonesia,['1706'],29.125,0.12824074074074077,0.3578703703703703,1
1727,1727,Dynamics of acute hepatitis c virus subject to responses of cytotoxic t lymphocytes and antibodies,"Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is so asymptomatic that it causes the majority of infected people to develop chronic hepatitis and ultimately cirrhotic hepatitis. Although some patients with AHCVI can undergo spontaneous clearance of the virus, most infected people still die of hepatitis C related-complications worldwide. This study proposed a mathematical model to investigate the transmission dynamics of acute hepatitis C virus with responses of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and antibodies. We established the expression for the basic reproductive number, R01 and computed the sensitivity indices of R01 pertaining to some model parameters. We found that the parameters for the production rate of susceptible hepatocytes,; infection rate, ω and virus production rate, β are positively sensitive. Besides, the most negatively sensitive parameter is the natural death rate of hepatocytes, μ while the least negatively sensitive parameter is the natural death rate of the virus, ε. We also performed numerical simulations, which validate the analytical results. Thus, we commend that early strategic intervention should be administered to a patient who is unable to clear the virus spontaneously to fight hepatitis C virus transmission by targeting the most sensitive model parameters. Absolutely, this will prevent disease evolution to more disastrous stages of infection.",60071676,Makerere University,Kampala,Uganda,['1703'],22.333333333333332,0.16956521739130437,0.626449275362319,1

The control chart is an important statistical technique that is used to monitor the quality of a process. Shewhart control charts help to detect larger shifts in the process parameters, but Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) charts are expected for smaller and moderate changes. The CUSUM control chart is normally used in industry for the result of small and moderate shifts in process spot and disparity. It can be shown that if there are sharp, irregular changes to a process, these types of charts are highly effective. On the other hand, if one involved in a small, persistent shift in a process, other types of control charts may be chosen, for instance the CUSUM control chart, originally developed by Page (1954).

For this reason, soil loss due to erosion must be well-known and identified carefully followed by efforts to reduce the amount of soil erosion in all areas that is greater than permissible erosion. To achieve these efforts, application of appropriate technology is needed. The application of drones is very helpful in the preparation and provision of precision agricultural management plans. In addition to being very helpful in estimating the amount of erosion, the use of drones is also very useful for setting recommendations for alternative soil and water conservation measures needed for each land unit.

1740,1740,A combined dynamical and bias correction technique for generating probabilistic daily rainfall forecasts over Indonesia,"Daily rainfall forecast has high importance in Indonesia because of its supporting role in various sectors. However, highresolution forecasts with many ensembles require high computing costs that hamper the development of regional weather/climate forecast, especially in Indonesia. This study aims to develop a daily operational ensemble forecasts with adequate validity and relatively low-computing cost to forecast rain occurrences over Indonesia. The model ensemble forecasts contain 21 ensemble members; each of them is obtained from Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) data. To justify the forecast results, this study used Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite data as a comparison. The forecasting procedure is as follows: First, Global Forecast System data are used as the initial condition of WRF to obtain regional scale forecast. Second, the output from WRF is used to obtain the correction factor by simple delta method. Third, the correction factor is then used to downscale all ensemble members of GEFS data to regional scale. Finally, using all ensemble members, probability of rain occurrences is then calculated. The rain occurrences are divided into six categories: sunny (no rainfall), cloudy, light rainfall, medium rainfall, high rainfall, and very high rainfall. The processes mentioned above are automated, and the outputs are issued daily. Results show that the model forecasts are consistent with GPM satellite data and have adequate forecast skills, especially over land areas. Moreover, the forecasts have a relatively short running time of approximately 22 hours; without the need of supercomputers. These results feature the possibility of low-computing cost of model ensemble daily weather forecasts over Indonesia.",60069381,IPB University,Bogor,Indonesia,['1706'],18.285714285714285,0.08682222222222223,0.32930476190476193,1

The social Internet of Things (IoT) allows products to automatically generate posts, share content and location information, and help build an online community of users based on their company's products, so that marketing personnel can also get useful feedback and understand the user's opinions. In tourism and hospitality industry, to enhance the revisit intention of passengers is an important issue for the purpose of increasing margin. In recent years, related researches had focused on the customers' revisit behaviors and factors. However, few studies have investigated the related issues that travelers do not want to visit again. Failure to revisit may bring a great damage to the company's revenue in the future. To avoid this situation, a text mining based approach will be proposed to identify non-revisit factors from online textual reviews in social media. Because it is impossible to determine whether a passenger has intention to revisit, this study proposed a text mining based approach which uses sentiment of text reviews to identify the passenger's motivations (negative for revisit and non-negative for revisit). Then, feature selection methods, decision tree (DT), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Support Vector Machines Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) will be utilized to discover the important factors of non-revisit factor set. Back-propagation Neural Networks (BPN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) will be employed to evaluate the effectiveness of selected feature sets.

Small crafts designs frequently require interventional changes to realise the desired guaranteed speed with their installed engine power. The appendages namely, the wedge, flap and anti-spray rails are used as retrofit measures or adapted in new hull forms, in isolation or in combination, to improve the drag and bring down the power requirement. A judicious combination of different appendages can result in significantly reduced drag and therefore power saving. The methodology combines the results of numerical and experimental investigations. The systematic study identifies the parameters for control namely, wedge flap size in terms of the chord length, its orientation vide the angle of the wedge flap, and the anti-spray rail location with respect to the water surface. The choice of the size of the wedge flap is a constrained problem since excessive wedge flap can cause problems related to length and hydrodynamic loading. This study establishes a solution by combination of a minimum integrated wedge flap with properly located anti-spray rail to reduce the drag.

The weight of the payload is selected such that the difference between weight and buoyancy is within the thrust limit of the vertical thrusters on the two HAUVs. The propulsion model is developed taking the effect of all the thrusters on the two HAUVs about the combined centre of body. The simulation platform is developed to observe the response of the entire system and of the individual HAUVs in the system at different revolutions of the thrusters. The stability of the entire system is ensured by maintaining the connection between the vehicles and payload. The simulation results show that stability and motion accuracy are compromised in the axial direction due to the opposite revolutions of the axial thrusters on the two HAUVs.",60022148,UCL,London,United Kingdom,['1702'],21.5,0.02552083333333334,0.38229166666666664,1
1752,1752,Start-Up Control of a Synchronous Condenser Integrated HVDC System with Power Electronics Based Static Frequency Converter,"The operation of thyristor-based high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system requires abundant reactive power support. Synchronous condensers, as rotating devices with large capacity of reactive power compensation, are generally utilized in HVDC systems. In this paper, the start-up control of a synchronous condenser integrated HVDC system with power electronics based static frequency converter (SFC) is investigated with the following 3 contributions: (1) Three different variable frequency starting methods are proposed regarding the main start-up control component, SFC. (2) Dynamic behaviors of AC voltages, reactive power of the system are studied when the synchronous condenser is integrated into the HVDC with different start-up control methods. An evaluation index, including successive rates of integration, reactive power surges, and lengths of start-up period, are established using different start-up control methods. (3) Synthesizing the characteristics of three different start-up control methods, an optimized variable frequency starting control is proposed and the control strategy is further developed. A simulation model of a synchronous condenser integrated HVDC system with an SFC is established in PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results justify the effectiveness and superiority of the optimized start-up control strategy proposed.",60010080,Nanjing University of Science and Technology,Nanjing,China,['1700'],22.75,0.0544973544973545,0.4765873015873015,1
1753,1753,Fostering English-use in a SALC through a discussion-based classroom intervention," All Rights Reserved.Self-access learning centres (SALCs) are spaces in which learners are provided with access to resources that can assist them in achieving their goals. Within the SALC at Kanda University of International Studies, there is a wide range of resources available to students. However, a prior in-house study (Yarwood, Lorentzen, Wallingford, & Wongsarnpigoon, 2019) indicated that the resources were not being fully utilised by the students. The aim of our intervention study was to explore how targeted discussion topics could be used in classroom settings to assist non-English major students in feeling supported in their autonomous use of English within the SALC context. Data were collected in the form of a post-intervention survey, and focus group interviews. The data were then analysed using Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT), a sub-theory within Self-Determination Theory (Ryan & Deci, 1987). Our findings suggest that the intervention fostered feelings of competence in both students’ English abilities, and their ability for self-reflection. Feelings of competence combined with support from peers motivated a portion of students to increase their use of English within the SALC. While many students felt that the intervention had helped them to increase their use of English in the SALC, the majority of students were uncertain about the effectiveness of the intervention. We will present several possible reasons for these findings.",60029243,Kanda University of International Studies,Chiba,Japan,['1706'],22.1,0.07890625000000001,0.2328125,0

To investigate types of emotions, the research integrates multiple qualitative methods and Plutchik’s wheel of emotions, thus acknowledging both contextually complex and longitudinally dynamic aspects of emotions. Throughout a year of 19 advisory sessions, the amount of time spent was 1,263 minutes (Ai’s 12 sessions = 891 minutes; Yu’s 7 sessions = 372 minutes), and the number of emotional incidences identified was 358 (201 for Ai; 157 for Yu). Among multiple findings, the most notable was that both participants experienced convergence of emotions: the one process from diversified to less diversified emotions was caused by longitudinal dynamics of emotions in Ai’s case and by contextual complexity of emotions in Yu’s case. The study concludes by suggesting a tentative four-dimensional model of emotions to capture trajectories of advisees’ emotions from multiple perspectives.

1762,1762,"The utilization of Sentinel 1-A dual polarization data for 20 - 22 February 2017 flood inundation mapping in Jakarta, Indonesia","Flood mapping is important to do as part of emergency response efforts in the event of a disaster. Usually, there are limitations in flood mapping with a direct approach and ineffective mapping efforts, such as: lack of time, cost, and number of personnel in the field. Utilization of remote sensing data can be used as an alternative to overcome this problem with an indirect approach. One of the uses of remote sensing data can be used to provide objective information and can be used to monitor, detect and map floods spatiallyorally. In this paper we will discuss of flood inundation mapping with several color composite combinations from dual-polarization Sentinel 1-A data using three classification methods. The data used is Sentinel 1-A dual-polarization data, in vertical-vertical receive (VV) and vertical-horizontal receive (VH) transmission mode. These datasets were acquired pre- (08 December 2016) and post- (22 February 2017) the flood even of 20 - 22 February 2017. This method is the detection of flooding of surface changes, the classification process for flood inundation mapping (maximum likelihood, minimum distance, and Mahalanobis distance), and then calculating an accuracy assessment. Six kinds of color combinations polarization combination Red Green Blue from the three classification methods. Flood detection of surface changes from a combination of six types of color composites gives very diverse results. The six types are VH-pre-flood - VH-post-flood - VH-pre-flood / VH-post-flood.

Then the SPH model was used to simulate the jacket fragmentation under different impact velocity and thickness of target plate. The influence of impact velocity and thickness of target plate on the jacket fragmentation was obtained by analysing the mass distribution and quantity distribution of the fragments formed by the jacket. The results show that the dynamic fragmentation of tungsten alloy can be simulated effectively using the SPH model, Johnson-Cook strength model, maximum tensile stress failure criterion and stochastic failure model. When the thickness of target plate is fixed, the greater the impact velocity, the greater the pressure produced by the projectile impacting the target plate; with the increase of impact velocity, the mass of residual projectile decreases, the number of fragments formed by fragmentation of jacket increases linearly, and the average mass of fragments decreases exponentially.

In this study, we focus on Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) as the global conservation icons. Hence, understanding Bornean orangutan's distribution dynamics is crucial regarding to conservation and climate mitigation strategies. The objectives of this study are: (1) to predict current and future spatial distribution of orangutan in Borneo using pessimistic climate model and land cover projection as well; (2) to identify spatial dynamics of Bornean orangutan distribution due to climate and land cover change in 2030. Species distribution modelling of baseline and future scenario was performed using logistic regression model. Land cover categories and climate parameters (i.e. annual temperature and precipitation) were used for model predictors. Presence points of observed primate species were retrieved from Ministry of Environment and Forestry Indonesia (MoEF). We used WorldClim v2.0 annual temperature and precipitation data for the baseline and CMIP5 MIROC-ESM model RCP8.5 2030 for the future climate scenario. We performed cellular automata algorithm to retrieve 2030 projected land-use for the future. Distance to road and distance to selected important land covers were used for transition potential modelling of land cover projection. Generally, the prediction shows that suitable habitat of Bornean orangutan will decrease in 2030. However, we found the gain of suitable area of Bornean orangutan.

The satellite system discussed in this paper is described for the problem arising due to presence of disturbances (colored and white noise). This model is evinced by the augmentation of discrete Kalman filter, a powerful tool for controlling the noisy estimates. Whereas, the regulation of the state dynamics (Euler angles and velocity) is achieved with the adaptive law which focuses on guaranteeing stability of adaptive control scheme using a good choice of Lyapunov argument.

1774,1774,A method for evaluating LAPAN-A3 operation based on raw data telemetry,"LAPAN-A3/IPB operated in Nadir Pointing Mode as normal mode. Maneuvers are carried out to maintain attitude at nadir or to change satellite's attitude to aim at the target in Target Pointing Mode. The attitude of the satellite when carry out the mission must be as close as possible to the target's attitude parameter in order to get accurate and good quality satellite image. When the attitude of the satellite is not the same as the target, a difference will be created and this should be evaluated regularly. Historical data on satellite attitude differences and other satellite operating parameters are stored in a telemetry logfile data. There are two types of logfiles, logfile-client and logfile-server. So far, logfile-client is used to evaluate satellite operations, but the logfiles are vulnerable to formatting changes, so more reliable logfile is needed, the logfile-server is suitable because there are no changes in formatting. Logfile- servers are raw data telemetry that are issued directly from satellites without any data processing, so processing data directly from the logfile-server will produce more reliable results.

1801,1801,Accurate Tracking of Manoeuvring Target using Scale Estimation and Detection," Fast moving target manifests in large inter-frame motion. In general, non-uniform background degrades performance of tracking algorithms. Fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based Correlation algorithms improve tracking in this scenario, but their applications is limited to small inter-frame motion. Increasing search region has implication on execution speed of the algorithms. Rapid target scaling, non-uniform background and large inter-frame motion of target hinder accurate and long term visual tracking. These challenges have been addressed for extended target tracking by augmenting fast discriminative scale space tracking (fDSST) algorithm with probable target location prediction and target detection. Localisation of fast motion has been achieved by applying fused outputs of Kalman filter and quadratic regression based prediction before applying fDSST. It has helped in accurate localisation of fast motion without increasing search region. In each frame, target location and size have been estimated using fDSST and further refined by target detection near this location. Smoothing and limiting of trajectory and size of detected target has enhanced tracking performance. Experimental results show considerable improvement of precision, success rate and centre location error tracking performance against state-of-the-art trackers in stringent conditions.",60031818,Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee,Roorkee,India,['1706'],16.727272727272727,0.1319548872180451,0.437719298245614,0

1803,1803,Neighbor-Induction and Population-Dispersion in Differential Evolution Algorithm,"The differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm predominantly relies on elite individuals and random difference to direct evolution. Although the strategy is clear and easy to implement, identifying a suitable direction for the DE mutation strongly depends on the direction information provided beforehand. To address this, we present a neighbor-induced mutation operator that simulates the neighbor-induced movement of Antarctic krill to guide the evolution direction in a natural manner. Additionally, center dispersion is proposed to disperse the population and redistribute individual positions to escape search stagnation, inspired by the spreading out of krill around newly discovered food. Comprising the new operator and the center dispersion pattern, this paper proposes a neighbor-induced DE algorithm with dispersion pattern (NDEd). The results of the comparative experiments verify the effectiveness of the neighbor-induced mutation operator and the dispersion pattern. Further, experimental results from 28 test functions of CEC2013 demonstrate that NDEd performs better compared to the other classic DE algorithms.",60017060,Central South University,Changsha,China,['1700'],22.142857142857142,0.10728114478114477,0.4139309764309764,1
1804,1804,Optimum distributions of heating surface areas in industrial boiler,"Industrial boiler consists of a furnace and a set of heat exchangers, which are evaporator, superheater, boiler bank, economizer, and air heater. Combustion of bagasse and air in the furnace produces thermal energy that is used to evaporate feed water and increase steam temperature in the superheater. Hot flue gas from the furnace also contributes to increasing steam temperature in the superheater. Hot flue gas then passes through the boiler bank, resulting in additional water evaporation. After that, it passes successively through the economizer, in which feed water temperature is increased, and the air heater, in which air temperature is increased, before being exhausted to the atmosphere. It is known qualitatively that the performance of the boiler is improved with the increase of the heating surface area of each component. Qualitative effects of increasing surface areas, however, require a boiler model that takes into account their effects. The unavailability of a suitable model in the open literature is the main reason why this paper is written. The proposed model assumes that superheater is divided into radiative superheater and convective superheater. Radiative superheater receives direct radiation from the furnace. Convective superheater, boiler bank, economizer, and air heater are convective heat exchangers. The model is used to determine the optimum distribution of the surface areas of superheater, economizer, and air heater that results in the minimum installation cost for a specified boiler efficiency and the optimum distribution of the surface areas that results in the maximum boiler efficiency for a specified installation cost.",60012521,Thammasat University,Patum Thani,Thailand,"['1712', '1708', '1705', '1702']",20.916666666666668,0.25740740740740736,0.6870370370370371,1

1815,1815,SBSGAN: Suppression of inter-domain background shift for person re-identification,"Cross-domain person re-identification (re-ID) is challenging due to the bias between training and testing domains. We observe that if backgrounds in the training and testing datasets are very different, it dramatically introduces difficulties to extract robust pedestrian features, and thus compromises the cross-domain person re-ID performance. In this paper, we formulate such problems as a background shift problem. A Suppression of Background Shift Generative Adversarial Network (SBSGAN) is proposed to generate images with suppressed backgrounds. Unlike simply removing backgrounds using binary masks, SBSGAN allows the generator to decide whether pixels should be preserved or suppressed to reduce segmentation errors caused by noisy foreground masks. Additionally, we take ID-related cues, such as vehicles and companions into consideration. With high-quality generated images, a Densely Associated 2-Stream (DA-2S) network is introduced with Inter Stream Densely Connection (ISDC) modules to strengthen the complementarity of the generated data and ID-related cues.

1819,1819,Biosensor platforms of the polarization-dependent metamaterial for the detection of cancer-cell concentration,"The rapid detection of cancer cells is crucial for clinical diagnosis in biomedical field. The traditional flow cytometry (FC) in visible band, a fluorescence-labelling detection, gives rise to the complicated sample preparation and the irrecoverable antibody consumption; it blocks the development toward a convenient detection platform with fast, inexpensive and non-labelling. Here, a specifically designed metamaterial based on split ring resonators (SRRs) is proposed. Such metamaterial operating in terahertz (THz) range exhibits polarization-dependent resonances, which are observed both in experiments and simulations. Additionally, the biosensing property of the metamaterial is investigated. On metamaterial surfaces, the lung cancer cells A549 are cultured. Under the irradiation of x-polarized THz waves, it is found that for the cell concentrations from 1×105 cells/ml to 5×105 cells/ml, the maximum frequency shift Δf (the frequency difference between measured sample and bare one) at 2.24 THz increases from 15 GHz to 137 GHz, respectively. Such results also imply that a larger cell concentration leads to a higher frequency shift. Subsequently, the samples are further measured at different polarization angles. The results show that for cell concentration of 5×105 cells/ml, the Δf exhibits the same value of 130 GHz when polarization angle equals 30° and 150°, and 15 GHz when polarization angle equals 60° and 120°.

1822,1822,Transmittance of high-density polyethylene from 0.1 THz to 15 THz,"High-density Polyethylene (HDPE), with a density above 0.95 g/cm3, has been widely used in terahertz systems. The advantages of low absorption loss, low refractive index and high rigidity make HDPE an ideal material for cryostat window, focus lens and substrate. HDPE can be machined easily and be used as a substrate material for components such as metal mesh filters and polarizers. What's more, it is quite inert and can be used at cryogenic temperatures. On account of these applications, we need to characterize the dielectric property of HDPE precisely in a wide frequency range. In this paper, we present the transmittance measurements of a 2 mm thick HDPE sheet from 0.1 THz to 15 THz. Three kinds of measurement methods are employed to cover the whole frequency range. A vector network analyzer (VNA) combined with a quasi-optical transmissometer has been used to measure the transmittance and dielectric constant of HDPE from 0.16 THz to 0.18 THz at 300 K and 4 K. A Time Domain Spectrometer (TDS) is employed to cover the frequency range from 0.2 THz to 3 THz since the VNA can't work upon 1 THz. A Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (FTS) has been used for the measurement from 3 THz to 15 THz since the TDS can't achieve broad band and fast scan speed. The measured transmittance of HDPE is nearly 0.93 below 1 THz and decrease to 0.3 when the frequency increase to 15 THz. A rather elusive absorption band at 2.2 THz has also been observed. The dielectric constant of HDPE has been measured by VNA and TDS, showing a frequency independency from 0.1 THz to 3 THz.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1706'],20.923076923076923,0.11421296296296296,0.42930555555555555,1
