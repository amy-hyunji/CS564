0,0,Online unsupervised learning of the 3D kinematic structure of arbitrary rigid bodies,"This work addresses the problem of 3D kinematic structure learning of arbitrary articulated rigid bodies from RGB-D data sequences. Typically, this problem is addressed by offline methods that process a batch of frames, assuming that complete point trajectories are available. However, this approach is not feasible when considering scenarios that require continuity and fluidity, for instance, human-robot interaction. In contrast, we propose to tackle this problem in an online unsupervised fashion, by recursively maintaining the metric distance of the scene's 3D structure, while achieving real-time performance. The influence of noise is mitigated by building a similarity measure based on a linear embedding representation and incorporating this representation into the original metric distance. The kinematic structure is then estimated based on a combination of implicit motion and spatial properties. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of estimation accuracy, even compared to offline methods.",60015150,Imperial College London,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707']",21.142857142857142,0.12166666666666667,0.53,1
1,1,Accurate monocular 3D object detection via color-embedded 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving,"In this paper, we propose a monocular 3D object detection framework in the domain of autonomous driving. Unlike previous image-based methods which focus on RGB feature extracted from 2D images, our method solves this problem in the reconstructed 3D space in order to exploit 3D contexts explicitly. To this end, we first leverage a stand-alone module to transform the input data from 2D image plane to 3D point clouds space for a better input representation, then we perform the 3D detection using PointNet backbone net to obtain objects' 3D locations, dimensions and orientations. To enhance the discriminative capability of point clouds, we propose a multi-modal feature fusion module to embed the complementary RGB cue into the generated point clouds representation. We argue that it is more effective to infer the 3D bounding boxes from the generated 3D scene space (i.e., X,Y, Z space) compared to the image plane (i.e., R,G,B image plane). Evaluation on the challenging KITTI dataset shows that our approach boosts the performance of state-of-the-art monocular approach by a large margin.",60025709,The University of Sydney,Sydney,Australia,"['1712', '1707']",28.833333333333332,0.31084656084656087,0.4920634920634921,1
2,2,Content and style disentanglement for artistic style transfer,"Artists rarely paint in a single style throughout their career. More often they change styles or develop variations of it. In addition, artworks in different styles and even within one style depict real content differently: While Picasso's Blue Period displays a vase in a blueish tone but as a whole, his Cubist works deconstruct the object. To produce artistically convincing stylizations, style transfer models must be able to reflect these changes and variations. Recently many works have aimed to improve the style transfer task, but neglected to address the described observations. We present a novel approach which captures particularities of style and the variations within and separates style and content. This is achieved by introducing two novel losses: A fixpoint triplet style loss to learn subtle variations within one style or between different styles and a disentanglement loss to ensure that the stylization is not conditioned on the real input photo. In addition the paper proposes various evaluation methods to measure the importance of both losses on the validity, quality and variability of final stylizations. We provide qualitative results to demonstrate the performance of our approach.",60016908,Universit√§t Heidelberg,Heidelberg,Germany,"['1712', '1707']",20.666666666666668,0.14677871148459384,0.5081932773109242,1
4,4,Enhancing low light videos by exploring high sensitivity camera noise,"Enhancing low light videos, which consists of denoising and brightness adjustment, is an intriguing but knotty problem. Under low light condition, due to high sensitivity camera setting, commonly negligible noises become obvious and severely deteriorate the captured videos. To recover high quality videos, a mass of image/video denoising/enhancing algorithms are proposed, most of which follow a set of simple assumptions about the statistic characters of camera noise, e.g., independent and identically distributed(i.i.d.), white, additive, Gaussian, Poisson or mixture noises. However, the practical noise under high sensitivity setting in real captured videos is complex and inaccurate to model with these assumptions. In this paper, we explore the physical origins of the practical high sensitivity noise in digital cameras, model them mathematically, and propose to enhance the low light videos based on the noise model by using an LSTM-based neural network. Specifically, we generate the training data with the proposed noise model and train the network with the dark noisy video as input and clear-bright video as output. Extensive comparisons on both synthetic and real captured low light videos with the state-of-the-art methods are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"['1712', '1707']",27.285714285714285,0.09160714285714286,0.38547619047619053,1
5,5,Bayes-factor-vae: Hierarchical bayesian deep auto-encoder models for factor disentanglement,"We propose a family of novel hierarchical Bayesian deep auto-encoder models capable of identifying disentangled factors of variability in data. While many recent attempts at factor disentanglement have focused on sophisticated learning objectives within the VAE framework, their choice of a standard normal as the latent factor prior is both suboptimal and detrimental to performance. Our key observation is that the disentangled latent variables responsible for major sources of variability, the relevant factors, can be more appropriately modeled using long-tail distributions. The typical Gaussian priors are, on the other hand, better suited for modeling of nuisance factors. Motivated by this, we extend the VAE to a hierarchical Bayesian model by introducing hyper-priors on the variances of Gaussian latent priors, mimicking an infinite mixture, while maintaining tractable learning and inference of the traditional VAEs. This analysis signifies the importance of partitioning and treating in a different manner the latent dimensions corresponding to relevant factors and nuisances. Our proposed models, dubbed Bayes-Factor-VAEs, are shown to outperform existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of latent disentanglement across several challenging benchmark tasks.",123285757,Rutgers University,New Jersey,United States,"['1712', '1707']",25.714285714285715,0.18731060606060607,0.5352272727272727,1
6,6,Bidirectional one-shot unsupervised domain mapping,"We study the problem of mapping between a domain A, in which there is a single training sample and a domain B, for which we have a richer training set. The method we present is able to perform this mapping in both directions. For example, we can transfer all MNIST images to the visual domain captured by a single SVHN image and transform the SVHN image to the domain of the MNIST images. Our method is based on employing one encoder and one decoder for each domain, without utilizing weight sharing. The autoencoder of the single sample domain is trained to match both this sample and the latent space of domain B. Our results demonstrate convincing mapping between domains, where either the source or the target domain are defined by a single sample, far surpassing existing solutions.

7,7,Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation with maximum squares loss,"Deep neural networks for semantic segmentation always require a large number of samples with pixel-level labels, which becomes the major difficulty in their real-world applications. To reduce the labeling cost, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches are proposed to transfer knowledge from labeled synthesized datasets to unlabeled real-world datasets. Recently, some semi-supervised learning methods have been applied to UDA and achieved state-of-the-art performance. One of the most popular approaches in semi-supervised learning is the entropy minimization method. However, when applying the entropy minimization to UDA for semantic segmentation, the gradient of the entropy is biased towards samples that are easy to transfer. To balance the gradient of well-classified target samples, we propose the maximum squares loss. Our maximum squares loss prevents the training process being dominated by easy-to-transfer samples in the target domain. Besides, we introduce the image-wise weighting ratio to alleviate the class imbalance in the unlabeled target domain. Both synthetic-to-real and cross-city adaptation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

8,8,Enhancing 2d representation via adjacent views for 3D shape retrieval,"Multi-view shape descriptors obtained from various 2D images are commonly adopted in 3D shape retrieval. One major challenge is that significant shape information are discarded during 2D view rendering through projection. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network based method, CenterNet, to enhance each individual 2D view using its neighboring ones. By exploiting cross-view correlations, CenterNet learns how adjacent views can be maximally incorporated for an enhanced 2D representation to effectively describe shapes. We observe that a very small amount of, e.g., six, enhanced 2D views, are already sufficient for a panoramic shape description. Thus, by simply aggregating features from six enhanced 2D views, we arrive at a highly compact yet discriminative shape descriptor. The proposed shape descriptor significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 3D shape retrieval methods on the ModelNet and ShapeNetCore55 benchmarks, and also exhibits robustness against object occlusion.",60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707']",20.0,0.09475,0.5867142857142857,1

10,10,Language features matter: Effective language representations for vision-language tasks,"Shouldn't language and vision features be treated equally in vision-language (VL) tasks? Many VL approaches treat the language component as an afterthought, using simple language models that are either built upon fixed word embeddings trained on text-only data or are learned from scratch. We conclude that language features deserve more attention, which has been informed by experiments which compare different word embeddings, language models, and embedding augmentation steps on five common VL tasks: Image-sentence retrieval, image captioning, visual question answering, phrase grounding, and text-to-clip retrieval. Our experiments provide some striking results; an average embedding language model outperforms a LSTM on retrieval-style tasks; state-of-the-art representations such as BERT perform relatively poorly on vision-language tasks. From this comprehensive set of experiments we can propose a set of best practices for incorporating the language component of vision-language tasks. To further elevate language features, we also show that knowledge in vision-language problems can be transferred across tasks to gain performance with multi-task training. This multi-task training is applied to a new Graph Oriented Vision-Language Embedding (GrOVLE), which we adapt from Word2Vec using WordNet and an original visual-language graph built from Visual Genome, providing a ready-to-use vision-language embedding: Http://ai.bu.edu/grovle.",60019674,Boston University,Boston,United States,"['1712', '1707']",32.33333333333333,0.13302139037433156,0.43598166539343003,1
11,11,Escaping plato's cave: 3D shape from adversarial rendering,"We introduce PlatonicGAN to discover the 3D structure of an object class from an unstructured collection of 2D images, i.e., where no relation between photos is known, except that they are showing instances of the same category. The key idea is to train a deep neural network to generate 3D shapes which, when rendered to images, are indistinguishable from ground truth images (for a discriminator) under various camera poses. Discriminating 2D images instead of 3D shapes allows tapping into unstructured 2D photo collections instead of relying on curated (e.g., aligned, annotated, etc.) 3D data sets. To establish constraints between 2D image observation and their 3D interpretation, we suggest a family of rendering layers that are effectively differentiable. This family includes visual hull, absorption-only (akin to x-ray), and emission-absorption. We can successfully reconstruct 3D shapes from unstructured 2D images and extensively evaluate PlatonicGAN on a range of synthetic and real data sets achieving consistent improvements over baseline methods. We further show that PlatonicGAN can be combined with 3D supervision to improve on and in some cases even surpass the quality of 3D-supervised methods.",60022148,UCL,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707']",26.0,0.16363636363636364,0.46893939393939393,1
12,12,AVT: Unsupervised learning of transformation equivariant representations by autoencoding variational transformations,"The learning of Transformation-Equivariant Representations (TERs), which is introduced by Hinton et al. cite{hinton2011transforming}, has been considered as a principle to reveal visual structures under various transformations. It contains the celebrated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a special case that only equivary to the translations. In contrast, we seek to train TERs for a generic class of transformations and train them in an {em unsupervised} fashion. To this end, we present a novel principled method by Autoencoding Variational Transformations (AVT), compared with the conventional approach to autoencoding data. Formally, given transformed images, the AVT seeks to train the networks by maximizing the mutual information between the transformations and representations. This ensures the resultant TERs of individual images contain the {em intrinsic} information about their visual structures that would equivary {em extricably} under various transformations in a generalized {em nonlinear} case. Technically, we show that the resultant optimization problem can be efficiently solved by maximizing a variational lower-bound of the mutual information. This variational approach introduces a transformation decoder to approximate the intractable posterior of transformations, resulting in an autoencoding architecture with a pair of the representation encoder and the transformation decoder. Experiments demonstrate the proposed AVT model sets a new record for the performances on unsupervised tasks, greatly closing the performance gap to the supervised models.",60002798,Chinese University of Hong Kong,Shatin,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707']",21.6,0.07337662337662337,0.39887445887445877,1

However, the efficacy of PFs as key source of information for learning generative models is not well studied. We investigate here the use of PFs in the context of learning implicit generative models through moment matching (MM). More specifically, we propose a new effective MM approach that learns implicit generative models by performing mean and covariance matching of features extracted from pretrained ConvNets. Our proposed approach improves upon existing MM methods by: (1) breaking away from the problematic min/max game of adversarial learning; (2) avoiding online learning of kernel functions; and (3) being efficient with respect to both number of used moments and required minibatch size.

Despite this success, however, it has been found that DNNs are surprisingly vulnerable to malicious attacks; adding a small, perceptually indistinguishable perturbations to the data can easily degrade classification performance. Adversarial training is an effective defense strategy to train a robust classifier. In this work, we propose to utilize the generator to learn how to create adversarial examples. Unlike the existing approaches that create a one-shot perturbation by a deterministic generator, we propose a recursive and stochastic generator that produces much stronger and diverse perturbations that comprehensively reveal the vulnerability of the target classifier. Our experiment results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that the classifier adversarially trained with our method yields more robust performance over various white-box and black-box attacks.",60032144,Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology,Yusong,South Korea,"['1712', '1707']",23.833333333333332,0.17948717948717946,0.44487179487179485,1

However, the aging process of each individual is more dominated by his/her personalized factors, including the invariant factors such as identity and mole, as well as the personalized aging patterns, e.g., one may age by graying hair while another may age by receding hairline. Following this biological principle, in this work, we propose an effective and efficient method to simulate natural aging. Specifically, a personalized aging basis is established for each individual to depict his/her own aging factors. Then different ages share this basis, being derived through age-specific transforms. The age-specific transforms represent the aging trends which are shared among all individuals. The proposed method can achieve continuous face aging with favorable aging accuracy, identity preservation, and fidelity.

In traditional handover schemes, choosing which one is the next-hop satellite for one user is only determined by evaluating some specific criteria in the current state, not guaranteeing long-term and global optimization.

We learn discriminative convex models for both affine and convex hulls of image sets. During testing, distances from the query set images to these models are computed efficiently by using simple matrix multiplications, and the query set is assigned to the person in the gallery whose image set is closest to the query images.

26,26,POD: Practical object detection with scale-sensitive network,"Scale-sensitive object detection remains a challenging task, where most of the existing methods not learn it explicitly and not robust to scale variance. In addition, the most existing methods are less efficient during training or slow during inference, which are not friendly to real-time application. In this paper, we propose a practical object detection with scale-sensitive network.Our method first predicts a global continuous scale ,which shared by all position, for each convolution filter of each network stage. To effectively learn the scale, we average the spatial features and distill the scale from channels. For fast-deployment, we propose a scale decomposition method that transfers the robust fractional scale into combinations of fixed integral scales for each convolution filter, which exploit the dilated convolution.

27,27,Explaining the ambiguity of object detection and 6D pose from visual data,"3D object detection and pose estimation from a single image are two inherently ambiguous problems. Oftentimes, objects appear similar from different viewpoints due to shape symmetries, occlusion and repetitive textures. This ambiguity in both detection and pose estimation means that an object instance can be perfectly described by several different poses and even classes. In this work we propose to explicitly deal with these ambiguities. For each object instance we predict multiple 6D pose outcomes to estimate the specific pose distribution generated by symmetries and repetitive textures. The distribution collapses to a single outcome when the visual appearance uniquely identifies just one valid pose. We show the benefits of our approach which provides not only a better explanation for pose ambiguity, but also a higher accuracy in terms of pose estimation.",60092530,"Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.",Shenzhen,China,"['1712', '1707']",18.714285714285715,0.07983193277310925,0.4134453781512605,1

Our USIP detector consists of a feature proposal network that learns stable keypoints from input 3D point clouds and their respective transformed pairs from randomly generated transformations. We provide degeneracy analysis and suggest solutions to prevent it. We encourage high repeatability and accurate localization of the keypoints with a probabilistic chamfer loss that minimizes the distances between the detected keypoints from the training point cloud pairs. Extensive experimental results of repeatability tests on several simulated and real-world 3D point cloud datasets from Lidar, RGB-D and CAD models show that our USIP detector significantly outperforms existing hand-crafted and deep learning-based 3D keypoint detectors.

29,29,HiPPI: Higher-order projected power iterations for scalable multi-matching,"The matching of multiple objects (e.g. shapes or images) is a fundamental problem in vision and graphics. In order to robustly handle ambiguities, noise and repetitive patterns in challenging real-world settings, it is essential to take geometric consistency between points into account. Computationally, the multi-matching problem is difficult. It can be phrased as simultaneously solving multiple (NP-hard) quadratic assignment problems (QAPs) that are coupled via cycle-consistency constraints. The main limitations of existing multi-matching methods are that they either ignore geometric consistency and thus have limited robustness, or they are restricted to small-scale problems due to their (relatively) high computational cost. We address these shortcomings by introducing a Higher-order Projected Power Iteration method, which is (i) efficient and scales to tens of thousands of points, (ii) straightforward to implement, (iii) able to incorporate geometric consistency, (iv) guarantees cycle-consistent multi-matchings, and (iv) comes with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Our method computes a non-linear transformation of given descriptor functions, while optimizing for global structural properties of the resulting maps, such as their bijectivity or approximate isometry. To this end, we use the functional maps framework, and build upon the recent FMNet architecture for descriptor learning. Unlike that approach, however, we show that learning can be done in a purely emph{unsupervised setting}, without having access to any ground truth correspondences. This results in a very general shape matching method that we call SURFMNet for Spectral Unsupervised FMNet, and which can be used to establish correspondences within 3D shape collections without any prior information. We demonstrate on a wide range of challenging benchmarks, that our approach leads to state-of-the-art results compared to the existing unsupervised methods and achieves results that are comparable even to the supervised learning techniques.

This paper proposes a collaborative mechanism design and verification method of automobile after-sales service multi-value-chain based on customer evaluation. First, it studies the composition of the service value chain during the warranty period, outside of the warranty period, and the insurance service, explores the source of income and gain factors of each value process to discover the appropriate service business and proving the ability of customer assessment for value creation in the value process. Then, establish a colored Petri Net model for each service value chain, the resources required for after-sales service are mapped to Token in Place and Place and the income is mapped to Transition, which can simulate the gain process of a single service-value-chain.

And the gain effect of multi-value-chain in collaborative status is simulated and operated on the CPN Tools which is a running platform based on colored Petri Net. The results show that the above-mentioned mechanism makes the expenses of important customers relatively reduced, and the income of service providers and insurers increased which is conducive to maintain the ability of auto service providers to extend after-sales service.

Therefore, we propose a novel end-to-end two- stage multi-scale attentive residual network that is both location-aware and density-aware, in order to preferably remove various rain streaks. Specifically, in the first stage, a multi-scale progressive attention sub- network is designed to automatically locate the distribution of diverse rain streaks and further to guide the following deraining. Then the second stage with the guidance of the attention map generated in the former stage aims to efficiently remove various rain streaks. To aggregate the characteristics of rain streaks with different scales and densities, we construct a multi-scale residual sub-network in which dilated convolution and residual learning are used to combine these features. As a result, these two sub-networks make up the whole network, and accomplish the process of joint detection and removal of diverse rain streaks fairly well.

However, the loss function for heatmap regression is rarely studied. In this paper, we analyze the ideal loss function properties for heatmap regression in face alignment problems. Then we propose a novel loss function, named Adaptive Wing loss, that is able to adapt its shape to different types of ground truth heatmap pixels. This adaptability penalizes loss more on foreground pixels while less on background pixels. To address the imbalance between foreground and background pixels, we also propose Weighted Loss Map, which assigns high weights on foreground and difficult background pixels to help training process focus more on pixels that are crucial to landmark localization. To further improve face alignment accuracy, we introduce boundary prediction and CoordConv with boundary coordinates.

Although existing methods perform well on images with small holes, restoring large holes remains elusive. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Progressive Reconstruction of Visual Structure (PRVS) network that progressively reconstructs the structures and the associated visual feature. Specifically, we design a novel Visual Structure Reconstruction (VSR) layer to entangle reconstructions of the visual structure and visual feature, which benefits each other by sharing parameters. We repeatedly stack four VSR layers in both encoding and decoding stages of a U-Net like architecture to form the generator of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for restoring images with either small or large holes. We prove the generalization error upper bound of the PRVS network is O(1sqrt(N)), which theoretically guarantees its performance. Extensive empirical evaluations and comparisons on Places2, Paris Street View and CelebA datasets validate the strengths of the proposed approach and demonstrate that the model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

This latent representation, together with another vector which characterizes user's style preference, are taken as the input to the generator network to generate the target item image. Two discriminator networks are built to guide the generation process. One is the classic real/fake discriminator. The other is a matching network which simultaneously models the compatibility between fashion items and learns users' preference representations.

However, we show that these techniques perform poorly when even a few labeled examples are available in the target domain. To address this semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) setting, we propose a novel Minimax Entropy (MME) approach that adversarially optimizes an adaptive few-shot model. Our base model consists of a feature encoding network, followed by a classification layer that computes the features' similarity to estimated prototypes (representatives of each class). Adaptation is achieved by alternately maximizing the conditional entropy of unlabeled target data with respect to the classifier and minimizing it with respect to the feature encoder. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method over many baselines, including conventional feature alignment and few-shot methods, setting a new state of the art for SSDA.

Although the metric learning part is well addressed, this metric is usually computed over the average of the extracted deep features. This representation is then trained to be discriminative. However, these deep features tend to be scattered across the feature space. Consequently, the representations are not robust to outliers, object occlusions, background variations, etc. In this paper, we tackle this scattering problem with a distribution-aware regularization named HORDE. This regularizer enforces visually-close images to have deep features with the same distribution which are well localized in the feature space. We provide a theoretical analysis supporting this regularization effect. We also show the effectiveness of our approach by obtaining state-of-the-art results on 4 well-known datasets (Cub-200-2011, Cars-196, Stanford Online Products and Inshop Clothes Retrieval).",60126116,Equipes Traitement de l'Information et Syst√®mes,Cergy-Pontoise,France,"['1712', '1707']",14.8,0.05769230769230768,0.33653846153846145,1

We significantly extend the framework of the recently proposed Neural AIDE, which formulates the denoiser to be context-based pixelwise mappings and utilizes the unbiased estimator of MSE for such denoisers. The two main contributions we make are; 1) implementing a novel fully convolutional architecture that boosts the base supervised model, and 2) introducing regularization methods for the adaptive fine-tuning such that a stronger and more robust adaptivity can be attained. As a result, FC-AIDE is shown to possess many desirable features; it outperforms the recent CNN-based state-of-the-art denoisers on all of the benchmark datasets we tested, and gets particularly strong for various challenging scenarios, e.g., with mismatched image/noise characteristics or with scarce supervised training data.

In spatial, we propose an effective and pluggable 'disentangling the skeleton from the details' (DSD) module. It reduces the complexity and decouples the skeleton, which lays a good foundation for temporal modeling. In temporal, the self-attention based temporal convolution network is proposed to efficiently exploit the short and long-term temporal cues. Furthermore, an unsupervised adversarial training strategy, temporal shuffles and order recovery, is designed to promote the learning of motion dynamics. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D human mesh recovery methods by 15.4% MPJPE and 23.8% PA-MPJPE on Human3.6M.

In this paper, we argue that directly estimating the alpha matte from a coarse trimap is a major limitation of previous methods, as this practice tries to address two difficult and inherently different problems at the same time: Identifying true blending pixels inside the trimap region, and estimate accurate alpha values for them. We propose AdaMatting, a new end-to-end matting framework that disentangles this problem into two sub-tasks: Trimap adaptation and alpha estimation. Trimap adaptation is a pixel-wise classification problem that infers the global structure of the input image by identifying definite foreground, background, and semi-transparent image regions. Alpha estimation is a regression problem that calculates the opacity value of each blended pixel. Our method separately handles these two sub-tasks within a single deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Extensive experiments show that AdaMatting has additional structure awareness and trimap fault-tolerance.

45,45,Weakly aligned cross-modal learning for multispectral pedestrian detection,"Multispectral pedestrian detection has shown great advantages under poor illumination conditions, since the thermal modality provides complementary information for the color image. However, real multispectral data suffers from the position shift problem, i.e. the color-thermal image pairs are not strictly aligned, making one object has different positions in different modalities. In deep learning based methods, this problem makes it difficult to fuse the feature maps from both modalities and puzzles the CNN training. In this paper, we propose a novel Aligned Region CNN (AR-CNN) to handle the weakly aligned multispectral data in an end-to-end way. Firstly, we design a Region Feature Alignment (RFA) module to capture the position shift and adaptively align the region features of the two modalities. Secondly, we present a new multimodal fusion method, which performs feature re-weighting to select more reliable features and suppress the useless ones. Besides, we propose a novel RoI jitter strategy to improve the robustness to unexpected shift patterns of different devices and system settings. Finally, since our method depends on a new kind of labelling: Bounding boxes that match each modality, we manually relabel the KAIST dataset by locating bounding boxes in both modalities and building their relationships, providing a new KAIST-Paired Annotation.

To solve the first problem, a novel reg-offset-cls (ROC) module is proposed. It contains three hierarchical steps: Box regression, the feature sampling location predication, and the regressed box classification with the features of offset locations. To further solve the second problem, a hierarchical shot detector (HSD) is proposed, which stacks two ROC modules and one feature enhanced module. The second ROC treats the regressed boxes and the feature sampling locations of features in the first ROC as the inputs. Meanwhile, the feature enhanced module injected between two ROCs aims to extract the local and non-local context.

We follow the traditional paradigm of performing depth-based warping and refinement, with a few key improvements. First, we estimate a depth probability volume, rather than just a single depth value for each pixel of the novel view. This allows us to leverage depth uncertainty in challenging regions, such as depth discontinuities. After using it to get an initial estimate of the novel view, we explicitly combine learned image priors and the depth uncertainty to synthesize a refined image with less artifacts.

However, they are hard to handle for machine learning algorithms due to the unordered structure. One common approach is to apply voxelization, which dramatically increases the amount of data stored and at the same time loses details through discretization. Recently, deep learning models with hand-tailored architectures were proposed to handle point clouds directly and achieve input permutation invariance. However, these architectures use an increased number of parameters and are computationally inefficient. In this work we propose basis point sets as a highly efficient and fully general way to process point clouds with machine learning algorithms. Basis point sets are a residual representation that can be computed efficiently and can be used with standard neural network architectures. Using the proposed representation as the input to a relatively simple network allows us to match the performance of PointNet on a shape classification task while using three order of magnitudes less floating point operations. In a second experiment, we show how proposed representation can be used for obtaining high resolution meshes from noisy 3D scans.

52,52,Unsupervised learning of landmarks by descriptor vector exchange,"Equivariance to random image transformations is an effective method to learn landmarks of object categories, such as the eyes and the nose in faces, without manual supervision. However, this method does not explicitly guarantee that the learned landmarks are consistent with changes between different instances of the same object, such as different facial identities. In this paper, we develop a new perspective on the equivariance approach by noting that dense landmark detectors can be interpreted as local image descriptors equipped with invariance to intra-category variations. We then propose a direct method to enforce such an invariance in the standard equivariant loss. We do so by exchanging descriptor vectors between images of different object instances prior to matching them geometrically. In this manner, the same vectors must work regardless of the specific object identity considered. We use this approach to learn vectors that can simultaneously be interpreted as local descriptors and dense landmarks, combining the advantages of both. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that this approach can match, and in some cases surpass state-of-the-art performance amongst existing methods that learn landmarks without supervision.

Our method is particularly well-suited for transmission imaging, where state-of-the-art feature detection and matching approaches generally do not perform well. Estimation of the fundamental matrix plays a central role in auto-calibration methods for reflection imaging. Such methods are currently not applicable to transmission imaging. Furthermore, our method extends an existing technique proposed for reflection imaging which potentially avoids the outlier-prone feature matching step from an orthographic projection model to a perspective model. Our method exploits the idea that under a linear attenuation model line integrals along corresponding epipolar lines are equal if we compute their derivatives in orthogonal direction to their common epipolar plane. We use the fundamental matrix to parametrize this equality. Our method estimates the matrix by formulating a non-convex optimization problem, minimizing an error in our measurement of this equality. We believe this technique will enable the application of the large body of work on image-based camera pose estimation to transmission imaging leading to more accurate and more general motion compensation and auto-calibration algorithms, particularly in medical X-ray and Computed Tomography imaging.",60000765,Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen-N√ºrnberg,Erlangen,Germany,"['1712', '1707']",22.22222222222222,0.09724702380952381,0.42470238095238094,1

Following prior work, we use an HMM grounded on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for frame labeling. Our key contribution is a new constrained discriminative forward loss (CDFL) that we use for training the HMM and GRU under weak supervision. While prior work typically estimates the loss on a single, inferred video segmentation, our CDFL discriminates between the energy of all valid and invalid frame labelings of a training video. A valid frame labeling satisfies the ground-truth temporal ordering of actions, whereas an invalid one violates the ground truth. We specify an efficient recursive algorithm for computing the CDFL in terms of the logadd function of the segmentation energy.

Our method uses solely 2D landmark annotations. No 3D data, multi-view/temporal footage, or object specific prior is required. This alleviates the data bottleneck, which is one of the major concern for supervised methods. The challenge for using NRSfM as teacher is that they often make poor depth reconstruction when the 2D projections have strong ambiguity. Directly using those wrong depth as hard target would negatively impact the student. Instead, we propose a novel loss that ties depth prediction to the cost function used in NRSfM. This gives the student pose estimator freedom to reduce depth error by associating with image features. Validated on H3.6M dataset, our learned 3D pose estimation network achieves more accurate reconstruction compared to NRSfM methods. It also outperforms other weakly supervised methods, in spite of using significantly less supervision.",60027950,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707']",15.0,-0.04732142857142858,0.4571428571428572,1
57,57,Fair loss: Margin-aware reinforcement learning for deep face recognition,"Recently, large-margin softmax loss methods, such as angular softmax loss (SphereFace), large margin cosine loss (CosFace), and additive angular margin loss (ArcFace), have demonstrated impressive performance on deep face recognition. These methods incorporate a fixed additive margin to all the classes, ignoring the class imbalance problem. However, imbalanced problem widely exists in various real-world face datasets, in which samples from some classes are in a higher number than others. We argue that the number of a class would influence its demand for the additive margin. In this paper, we introduce a new margin-aware reinforcement learning based loss function, namely fair loss, in which each class will learn an appropriate adaptive margin by Deep Q-learning. Specifically, we train an agent to learn a margin adaptive strategy for each class, and make the additive margins for different classes more reasonable. Our method has better performance than present large-margin loss functions on three benchmarks, Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW), Youtube Faces (YTF) and MegaFace, which demonstrates that our method could learn better face representation on imbalanced face datasets.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707']",25.142857142857142,0.2300324675324675,0.4766558441558442,1

In this work, we take an initial attempt towards this direction. We first revisit and systematically analyze object detectors and many recently developed attacks from the perspective of model robustness. We then present a multi-task learning perspective of object detection and identify an asymmetric role of task losses.

The proposed SAN mainly includes three components: Saliency detector, Saliency-weighted Visual Attention (SVA) module, and Saliency-guided Textual Attention (STA) module. Concretely, the saliency detector provides the visual saliency information to drive both two attention modules. Taking advantage of the saliency information, SVA is able to learn more discriminative visual features. By fusing the visual information from SVA and intra-modal information as a multi-modal guidance, STA affords us powerful textual representations that are synchronized with visual clues.

Furthermore, most of them are small-scale and lack of diversity due to the high cost of collecting and labeling near-duplicate videos.

In this work, we present an intelligent and user-friendly 3D editing tool, where the edited model is constrained to lie onto a learned manifold of realistic shapes. Due to the topological variability of real 3D models, they often lie close to a disconnected manifold, which cannot be learned with a common learning algorithm. Therefore, our tool is based on a new deep learning model, DiscoNet, which extends 3D surface autoencoders in two ways. Firstly, our deep learning model uses several autoencoders to automatically learn each connected component of a disconnected manifold, without any supervision. Secondly, each autoencoder infers the output 3D surface by deforming a pre-learned 3D template specific to each connected component.

Previous efforts mostly exploit optical flow to propagate features across frames, aiming to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. However, introducing an extra model to estimate optical flow can significantly increase the overall model size. The gap between optical flow and high-level features can also hinder it from establishing spatial correspondence accurately. Instead of relying on optical flow, this paper proposes a novel module called Progressive Sparse Local Attention (PSLA), which establishes the spatial correspondence between features across frames in a local region with progressively sparser stride and uses the correspondence to propagate features. Based on PSLA, Recursive Feature Updating (RFU) and Dense Feature Transforming (DenseFT) are proposed to model temporal appearance and enrich feature representation respectively in a novel video object detection framework.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method named Pose-Guided Feature Alignment (PGFA), exploiting pose landmarks to disentangle the useful information from the occlusion noise. During the feature constructing stage, our method utilizes human landmarks to generate attention maps. The generated attention maps indicate if a specific body part is occluded and guide our model to attend to the non-occluded regions. During matching, we explicitly partition the global feature into parts and use the pose landmarks to indicate which partial features belonging to the target person. Only the visible regions are utilized for the retrieval. Besides, we construct a large-scale dataset for the Occluded Person Re-ID problem, namely Occluded-DukeMTMC, which is by far the largest dataset for the Occlusion Person Re-ID.

74,74,Unpaired image-to-speech synthesis with multimodal information bottleneck,"Deep generative models have led to significant advances in cross-modal generation such as text-to-image synthesis. Training these models typically requires paired data with direct correspondence between modalities. We introduce the novel problem of translating instances from one modality to another without paired data by leveraging an intermediate modality shared by the two other modalities. To demonstrate this, we take the problem of translating images to speech. In this case, one could leverage disjoint datasets with one shared modality, e.g., image-text pairs and text-speech pairs, with text as the shared modality. We call this problem ''skip-modal generation'' because the shared modality is skipped during the generation process. We propose a multimodal information bottleneck approach that learns the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data (image and speech) by leveraging the shared modality (text). We address fundamental challenges of skip-modal generation: 1) learning multimodal representations using a single model, 2) bridging the domain gap between two unrelated datasets, and 3) learning the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data. We show qualitative results on image-to-speech synthesis; this is the first time such results have been reported in the literature.

77,77,Resolving 3D human pose ambiguities with 3D scene constraints,"To understand and analyze human behavior, we need to capture humans moving in, and interacting with, the world. Most existing methods perform 3D human pose estimation without explicitly considering the scene. We observe however that the world constrains the body and vice-versa. To motivate this, we show that current 3D human pose estimation methods produce results that are not consistent with the 3D scene. Our key contribution is to exploit static 3D scene structure to better estimate human pose from monocular images. The method enforces Proximal Relationships with Object eXclusion and is called PROX. To test this, we collect a new dataset composed of 12 different 3D scenes and RGB sequences of 20 subjects moving in and interacting with the scenes. We represent human pose using the 3D human body model SMPL-X and extend SMPLify-X to estimate body pose using scene constraints. We make use of the 3D scene information by formulating two main constraints. The inter-penetration constraint penalizes intersection between the body model and the surrounding 3D scene. The contact constraint encourages specific parts of the body to be in contact with scene surfaces if they are close enough in distance and orientation.

78,78,Selective sparse sampling for fine-grained image recognition,"Fine-grained recognition poses the unique challenge of capturing subtle inter-class differences under considerable intra-class variances (e.g., beaks for bird species). Conventional approaches crop local regions and learn detailed representation from those regions, but suffer from the fixed number of parts and missing of surrounding context. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework, called Selective Sparse Sampling, to capture diverse and fine-grained details. The framework is implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks, referred to as Selective Sparse Sampling Networks (S3Ns). With image-level supervision, S3Ns collect peaks, i.e., local maximums, from class response maps to estimate informative, receptive fields and learn a set of sparse attention for capturing fine-detailed visual evidence as well as preserving context. The evidence is selectively sampled to extract discriminative and complementary features, which significantly enrich the learned representation and guide the network to discover more subtle cues. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmarks including CUB-200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft, and Stanford Cars.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707']",23.714285714285715,0.1216931216931217,0.4401455026455026,1

Hence, these methods do not fully exploit the characteristics of the lip dynamics, causing two main drawbacks. First, the short-range temporal dependencies, which are critical to the mapping from lip images to visemes, receives no extra attention. Second, local spatial information is discarded in the existing sequence models due to the use of global average pooling (GAP). To well solve these drawbacks, we propose a Temporal Focal block to sufficiently describe short-range dependencies and a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module (STFM) to maintain the local spatial information and to reduce the feature dimensions as well. From the experiment results, it is demonstrated that our method achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art approach using much less training data and much lighter Convolutional Feature Extractor.

The images captured with ultra wide field-of-view (FOV) cameras on an omnidirectional rig are processed by the feature extraction module, and then the deep feature maps are warped onto the concentric spheres swept through all candidate depths using the calibrated camera parameters. The 3D encoder-decoder block takes the aligned feature volume to produce the omnidirectional depth estimate with regularization on uncertain regions utilizing the global context information. In addition, we present large-scale synthetic datasets for training and testing omnidirectional multi-view stereo algorithms. Our datasets consist of 11K ground-truth depth maps and 45K fisheye images in four orthogonal directions with various objects and environments.

Often, sizable empirical improvements are possible when the geometry of such data spaces are incorporated into the design of the model, architecture, and algorithms. Motivated by neuroimaging applications, we study formulations where the data are {em sequential manifold-valued measurements}. This case is common in brain imaging, where the samples correspond to symmetric positive definite matrices or orientation distribution functions. Instead of a recurrent model which poses computational/technical issues, and inspired by recent results showing the viability of dilated convolutional models for sequence prediction, we develop a dilated convolutional neural network architecture for this task. On the technical side, we show how the modules needed in our network can be derived while explicitly taking the Riemannian manifold structure into account. We show how the operations needed can leverage known results for calculating the weighted Fr'{e}chet Mean (wFM).

The physics of water flow suggests that water surfaces possess spatio-temporal smoothness and temporal periodicity. Hence they possess a sparse representation in the 3D discrete Fourier (DFT) basis. Motivated by this, we pose the task of restoration of such video sequences as a compressed sensing (CS) problem. We begin by tracking a few salient feature points across the frames of a video sequence of the submerged scene. Using these point trajectories, we show that the motion fields at all other (non-tracked) points can be effectively estimated using a typical CS solver. This by itself is a novel contribution in the field of non-rigid motion estimation. We show that this method outperforms state of the art algorithms for underwater image restoration. We further consider a simple optical flow algorithm based on local polynomial expansion of the image frames (PEOF). Surprisingly, we demonstrate that PEOF is more efficient and often outperforms all the state of the art methods in terms of numerical measures. Finally, we demonstrate that a two-stage approach consisting of the CS step followed by PEOF much more accurately preserves the image structure and improves the (visual as well as numerical) video quality as compared to just the PEOF stage.

85,85,Wavelet domain style transfer for an effective perception-distortion tradeoff in single image super-resolution,"In single image super-resolution (SISR), given a low-resolution (LR) image, one wishes to find a high-resolution (HR) version of it which is both accurate and photorealistic. Recently, it has been shown that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between low distortion and high perceptual quality, and the generative adversarial network (GAN) is demonstrated to approach the perception-distortion (PD) bound effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on wavelet domain style transfer (WDST), which achieves a better PD tradeoff than the GAN based methods. Specifically, we propose to use 2D stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to decompose one image into low-frequency and high-frequency sub-bands. For the low-frequency sub-band, we improve its objective quality through an enhancement network. For the high-frequency sub-band, we propose to use WDST to effectively improve its perceptual quality. By feat of the perfect reconstruction property of wavelets, these sub-bands can be re-combined to obtain an image which has simultaneously high objective and perceptual quality. The numerical results on various datasets show that our method achieves the best trade-off between the distortion and perceptual quality among the existing state-of-the-art SISR methods.",60025858,ETH Z√ºrich,"Zurich ZH,",Switzerland,"['1712', '1707']",23.0,0.3106122448979592,0.4698299319727891,1

Longitudinal image acquisitions are common in various scientific and biomedical studies where often each image sequence sample may also come together with various secondary (fixed or temporally dependent) measurements. The key goal is not only to estimate the parameters of a deep generative model for the given longitudinal data, but also to enable evaluation of how the temporal course of the generated longitudinal samples are influenced as a function of induced changes in the (secondary) temporal measurements (or events). Our proposed formulation incorporates recurrent subnetworks and temporal context gating, which provides a smooth transition in a temporal sequence of generated data that can be easily informed or modulated by secondary temporal conditioning variables. We show that the formulation works well despite the smaller sample sizes common in these applications. Our model is validated on two video datasets and a longitudinal Alzheimer's disease (AD) dataset for both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated samples.

90,90,Pointflow: 3D point cloud generation with continuous normalizing flows,"As 3D point clouds become the representation of choice for multiple vision and graphics applications, the ability to synthesize or reconstruct high-resolution, high-fidelity point clouds becomes crucial. Despite the recent success of deep learning models in discriminative tasks of point clouds, generating point clouds remains challenging. This paper proposes a principled probabilistic framework to generate 3D point clouds by modeling them as a distribution of distributions. Specifically, we learn a two-level hierarchy of distributions where the first level is the distribution of shapes and the second level is the distribution of points given a shape. This formulation allows us to both sample shapes and sample an arbitrary number of points from a shape. Our generative model, named PointFlow, learns each level of the distribution with a continuous normalizing flow. The invertibility of normalizing flows enables the computation of the likelihood during training and allows us to train our model in the variational inference framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that PointFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud generation. We additionally show that our model can faithfully reconstruct point clouds and learn useful representations in an unsupervised manner.

However, important real-time applications including surveillance and driver assistance systems require identifying actions as soon as each video frame arrives, based only on current and historical observations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, the Temporal Recurrent Network (TRN), to model greater temporal context of each frame by simultaneously performing online action detection and anticipation of the immediate future. At each moment in time, our approach makes use of both accumulated historical evidence and predicted future information to better recognize the action that is currently occurring, and integrates both of these into a unified end-to-end architecture.

92,92,Video classification with channel-separated convolutional networks,"Group convolution has been shown to offer great computational savings in various 2D convolutional architectures for image classification. It is natural to ask: 1) if group convolution can help to alleviate the high computational cost of video classification networks; 2) what factors matter the most in 3D group convolutional networks; and 3) what are good computation/accuracy trade-offs with 3D group convolutional networks. This paper studies the effects of different design choices in 3D group convolutional networks for video classification. We empirically demonstrate that the amount of channel interactions plays an important role in the accuracy of 3D group convolutional networks. Our experiments suggest two main findings. First, it is a good practice to factorize 3D convolutions by separating channel interactions and spatiotemporal interactions as this leads to improved accuracy and lower computational cost. Second, 3D channel-separated convolutions provide a form of regularization, yielding lower training accuracy but higher test accuracy compared to 3D convolutions. These two empirical findings lead us to design an architecture - Channel-Separated Convolutional Network (CSN) - which is simple, efficient, yet accurate.

Most generative models rely on 2D kernels to generate images and make few assumptions about the 3D world. These models therefore tend to create blurry images or artefacts in tasks that require a strong 3D understanding, such as novel-view synthesis. HoloGAN instead learns a 3D representation of the world, and to render this representation in a realistic manner. Unlike other GANs, HoloGAN provides explicit control over the pose of generated objects through rigid-body transformations of the learnt 3D features. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features enables HoloGAN to disentangle 3D pose and identity, which is further decomposed into shape and appearance, while still being able to generate images with similar or higher visual quality than other generative models. HoloGAN can be trained end-to-end from unlabelled 2D images only. Particularly, we do not require pose labels, 3D shapes, or multiple views of the same objects. This shows that HoloGAN is the first generative model that learns 3D representations from natural images in an entirely unsupervised manner.",60030480,University of Bath,Bath,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707']",20.77777777777778,0.08833333333333335,0.40791666666666665,1
95,95,Spectral feature transformation for person re-identification,"With the surge of deep learning techniques, the field of person re-identification has witnessed rapid progress in recent years. Deep learning based methods focus on learning a discriminative feature space where data points are clustered compactly according to their corresponding identities. Most existing methods process data points individually or only involves a fraction of samples while building a similarity structure. They ignore dense informative connections among samples more or less. The lack of holistic observation eventually leads to inferior performance. To relieve the issue, we propose to formulate the whole data batch as a similarity graph. Inspired by spectral clustering, a novel module termed Spectral Feature Transformation is developed to facilitate the optimization of group-wise similarities. It adds no burden to the inference and can be applied to various scenarios. As a natural extension, we further derive a lightweight re-ranking method named Local Blurring Re-ranking which makes the underlying clustering structure around the probe set more compact.

The intuition behind is to leverage the coupled nature of these two tasks to improve the granularity and performance of scene understanding.

The optimal configuration of the 3D scene, represented by a parse graph, is inferred using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which efficiently traverses through the non-differentiable joint solution space.

98,98,AdvPattern: Physical-world attacks on deep person re-identification via adversarially transformable patterns,"Person re-identification (re-ID) is the task of matching person images across camera views, which plays an important role in surveillance and security applications. Inspired by great progress of deep learning, deep re-ID models began to be popular and gained state-of-the-art performance. However, recent works found that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing potential threats to DNNs based applications. This phenomenon throws a serious question about whether deep re-ID based systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we take the first attempt to implement robust physical-world attacks against deep re-ID. We propose a novel attack algorithm, called advPattern, for generating adversarial patterns on clothes, which learns the variations of image pairs across cameras to pull closer the image features from the same camera, while pushing features from different cameras farther. By wearing our crafted 'invisible cloak', an adversary can evade person search, or impersonate a target person to fool deep re-ID models in physical world. We evaluate the effectiveness of our transformable patterns on adversaries' clothes with Market1501 and our established PRCS dataset. The experimental results show that the rank-1 accuracy of re-ID models for matching the adversary decreases from 87.9% to 27.1% under Evading Attack. Furthermore, the adversary can impersonate a target person with 47.1% rank-1 accuracy and 67.9% mAP under Impersonation Attack.

Our key insight is that sharing features makes the network more compact, induces better feature representations, and can better exploit interactions among these tasks to handle partially labeled data. With a shared encoder, we can flexibly add decoders for different tasks during training. This modular design leads to a compact and efficient model at inference time. Exploiting the interactions among these tasks allows us to introduce distillation and self-supervised losses in addition to supervised losses, which can better handle partially labeled real-world data.

A shared common ground among systems which successfully achieve this feat is the integration of previously encountered observations into the current state being estimated. This necessitates the use of a memory module for incorporating previously visited states whilst simultaneously offering an internal representation of the observed environment. In this work we develop a memory module which contains rigidly aligned point-embeddings that represent a coherent scene structure acquired from an RGB-D sequence of observations. The point-embeddings are extracted using modern convolutional neural network architectures, and alignment is performed by computing a dense correspondence matrix between a new observation and the current embeddings residing in the memory module. The whole framework is end-to-end trainable, resulting in a recurrent joint optimisation of the point-embeddings contained in the memory. This process amplifies the shared information across states, providing increased robustness and accuracy.

103,103,Autofocus: Efficient multi-scale inference,"This paper describes AutoFocus, an efficient multi-scale inference algorithm for deep-learning based object detectors. Instead of processing an entire image pyramid, AutoFocus adopts a coarse to fine approach and only processes regions which are likely to contain small objects at finer scales. This is achieved by predicting category agnostic segmentation maps for small objects at coarser scales, called FocusPixels. FocusPixels can be predicted with high recall, and in many cases, they only cover a small fraction of the entire image. To make efficient use of FocusPixels, an algorithm is proposed which generates compact rectangular FocusChips which enclose FocusPixels. The detector is only applied inside FocusChips, which reduces computation while processing finer scales. Different types of error can arise when detections from FocusChips of multiple scales are combined, hence techniques to correct them are proposed.

104,104,Collect and select: Semantic alignment metric learning for few-shot learning,"Few-shot learning aims to learn latent patterns from few training examples and has shown promises in practice. However, directly calculating the distances between the query image and support image in existing methods may cause ambiguity because dominant objects can locate anywhere on images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Semantic Alignment Metric Learning (SAML) method for few-shot learning that aligns the semantically relevant dominant objects through a ''collect-and-select'' strategy. Specifically, we first calculate a relation matrix (RM) to ''collect' the distances of each local region pairs of the 3D tensor extracted from a query image and the mean tensor of the support images. Then, the attention technique is adapted to ''select' the semantically relevant pairs and put more weights on them. Afterwards, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is utilized to map the reweighted RMs to their corresponding similarity scores. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the generalization ability of SAML and gives a theoretical guarantee. Empirical results demonstrate that semantic alignment is achieved. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the strengths of the proposed approach and demonstrate that SAML significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

Some efforts use soft attention to reallocate distant outliers to their most similar parts, while others adjust part granularity to incorporate more distant positions for learning the relationships. Others seek to generalize part-based methods by introducing a dropout mechanism on consecutive regions of the feature map to enhance distant region relationships. However, only few prior efforts model the distant or non-local positions of the feature map directly for the person re-ID task.

112,112,CapsuleVOS: Semi-supervised video object segmentation using capsule routing,"In this work we propose a capsule-based approach for semi-supervised video object segmentation. Current video object segmentation methods are frame-based and often require optical flow to capture temporal consistency across frames which can be difficult to compute. To this end, we propose a video based capsule network, CapsuleVOS, which can segment several frames at once conditioned on a reference frame and segmentation mask. This conditioning is performed through a novel routing algorithm for attention-based efficient capsule selection. We address two challenging issues in video object segmentation: 1) segmentation of small objects and 2) occlusion of objects across time. The issue of segmenting small objects is addressed with a zooming module which allows the network to process small spatial regions of the video. Apart from this, the framework utilizes a novel memory module based on recurrent networks which helps in tracking objects when they move out of frame or are occluded. The network is trained end-to-end and we demonstrate its effectiveness on two benchmark video object segmentation datasets; it outperforms current offline approaches on the Youtube-VOS dataset while having a run-time that is almost twice as fast as competing methods.

The majority of existing algorithms focus on aggregating multi-level features of pre-trained convolutional neural networks. Moreover, some researchers attempt to utilize edge information for auxiliary training. However, existing edge-aware models design unidirectional frameworks which only use edge features to improve the segmentation features. Motivated by the logical interrelations between binary segmentation and edge maps, we propose a novel Stacked Cross Refinement Network (SCRN) for salient object detection in this paper. Our framework aims to simultaneously refine multi-level features of salient object detection and edge detection by stacking Cross Refinement Unit (CRU). According to the logical interrelations, the CRU designs two direction-specific integration operations, and bidirectionally passes messages between the two tasks. Incorporating the refined edge-preserving features with the typical U-Net, our model detects salient objects accurately.

In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods require hundreds of training examples for each possible category to build reliable and accurate classifiers. To alleviate this striking difference in efficiency, we propose a task-driven modular architecture for compositional reasoning and sample efficient learning. Our architecture consists of a set of neural network modules, which are small fully connected layers operating in semantic concept space. These modules are configured through a gating function conditioned on the task to produce features representing the compatibility between the input image and the concept under consideration. This enables us to express tasks as a combination of sub-tasks and to generalize to unseen categories by reweighting a set of small modules. Furthermore, the network can be trained efficiently as it is fully differentiable and its modules operate on small sub-spaces. We focus our study on the problem of compositional zero-shot classification of object-attribute categories. We show in our experiments that current evaluation metrics are flawed as they only consider unseen object-attribute pairs.

First, we build a dataset of substation meters with 1432 images as the training set and 615 images as the test set. We use data augmentation strategy to solve the problem of data shortage and class-imbalance. Second, according to the characteristics of the meter image, feature pyramid is used to train the model to effectively improve the recognition performance. Finally, we use the training warm-up method to reduce the over-fitting of the training model. Experiments results show that, compared with other methods, our method can achieve better performance on several benchmarks. The detection recall improves from 88.03% to 96.08% and mAP improves from 89.64% to 93.84% on the premise of ensuring real-time performance.",60019533,Tianjin University,Tianjin,China,['1700'],17.8,0.23379120879120882,0.5015567765567766,1
133,133,Convolutional character networks,"Recent progress has been made on developing a unified framework for joint text detection and recognition in natural images, but existing joint models were mostly built on two-stage framework by involving ROI pooling, which can degrade the performance on recognition task. In this work, we propose convolutional character networks, referred as CharNet, which is an one-stage model that can process two tasks simultaneously in one pass. CharNet directly outputs bounding boxes of words and characters, with corresponding character labels. We utilize character as basic element, allowing us to overcome the main difficulty of existing approaches that attempted to optimize text detection jointly with a RNN-based recognition branch. In addition, we develop an iterative character detection approach able to transform the ability of character detection learned from synthetic data to real-world images. These technical improvements result in a simple, compact, yet powerful one-stage model that works reliably on multi-orientation and curved text. We evaluate CharNet on three standard benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches [25, 24] by a large margin, e.g., with improvements of 65.33%->71.08% (with generic lexicon) on ICDAR 2015, and 54.0%->69.23% on Total-Text, on end-to-end text recognition.

The first (baseline) solution is a basic differentiable algebraic triangulation with an addition of confidence weights estimated from the input images. The second, more complex, solution is based on volumetric aggregation of 2D feature maps from the 2D backbone followed by refinement via 3D convolutions that produce final 3D joint heatmaps. Crucially, both of the approaches are end-to-end differentiable, which allows us to directly optimize the target metric.

BRM takes the form of a probabilistic relation graph over semantic entities (e.g., room types), which allows (1) capturing the layout prior from training environments, i.e., prior knowledge, (2) estimating posterior layout at test time, i.e., memory update, and (3) efficient planning for navigation, altogether. We develop a BRM agent consisting of a BRM module for producing sub-goals and a goal-conditioned locomotion module for control. When testing in unseen environments, the BRM agent outperforms baselines that do not explicitly utilize the probabilistic relational memory structure.",60025038,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,United States,"['1712', '1707']",29.75,0.03409090909090909,0.11363636363636363,1

In this work, we consider a new task of visual information-infused audio inpainting, i.e., synthesizing missing audio segments that correspond to their accompanying videos. We identify two key aspects for a successful inpainter: (1) It is desirable to operate on spectrograms instead of raw audios. Recent advances in deep semantic image inpainting could be leveraged to go beyond the limitations of traditional audio inpainting. (2) To synthesize visually indicated audio, a visual-audio joint feature space needs to be learned with synchronization of audio and video. To facilitate a large-scale study, we collect a new multi-modality instrument-playing dataset called MUSIC-Extra-Solo (MUSICES) by enriching MUSIC dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework is capable of inpainting realistic and varying audio segments with or without visual contexts. More importantly, our synthesized audio segments are coherent with their video counterparts, showing the effectiveness of our proposed Vision-Infused Audio Inpainter (VIAI).",60006541,The University of Hong Kong,Pokfulam,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707']",19.25,0.08043123543123543,0.46686480186480184,1
137,137,Enforcing geometric constraints of virtual normal for depth prediction,"Monocular depth prediction plays a crucial role in understanding 3D scene geometry. Although recent methods have achieved impressive progress in evaluation metrics such as the pixel-wise relative error, most methods neglect the geometric constraints in the 3D space. In this work, we show the importance of the high-order 3D geometric constraints for depth prediction. By designing a loss term that enforces one simple type of geometric constraints, namely, virtual normal directions determined by randomly sampled three points in the reconstructed 3D space, we can considerably improve the depth prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we can not only predict accurate depth but also achieve high-quality other 3D information from the depth without retraining new parameters, Significantly, the byproduct of this predicted depth being sufficiently accurate is that we are now able to recover good 3D structures of the scene such as the point cloud and surface normal directly from the depth, eliminating the necessity of training new sub-models as was previously done.

138,138,ACFNet: Attentional class feature network for semantic segmentation,"Recent works have made great progress in semantic segmentation by exploiting richer context, most of which are designed from a spatial perspective. In contrast to previous works, we present the concept of class center which extracts the global context from a categorical perspective. This class-level context describes the overall representation of each class in an image. We further propose a novel module, named Attentional Class Feature (ACF) module, to calculate and adaptively combine different class centers according to each pixel. Based on the ACF module, we introduce a coarse-to-fine segmentation network, called Attentional Class Feature Network (ACFNet), which can be composed of an ACF module and any off-the-shell segmentation network (base network). In this paper, we use two types of base networks to evaluate the effectiveness of ACFNet.

While much recent work has focused on the RGB domain, the reliance on accurately annotated images limits generalizability and scalability. On the other hand, the easily available object CAD models are rich sources of data, providing a large number of synthetically rendered images. In this paper, we solve this key problem of existing methods requiring expensive 3D pose annotations by proposing a new method that matches RGB images to CAD models for object pose estimation. Our key innovations compared to existing work include removing the need for either real-world textures for CAD models or explicit 3D pose annotations for RGB images. We achieve this through a series of objectives that learn how to select keypoints and enforce viewpoint and modality invariance across RGB images and CAD model renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can reliably estimate object pose in RGB images and generalize to object instances not seen during training.",60028673,Siemens AG,Munich,Germany,"['1712', '1707']",23.0,0.09006493506493506,0.5991450216450216,1
140,140,Attention-based autism spectrum disorder screening with privileged modality,"This paper presents a novel framework for automatic and quantitative screening of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is motivated to address two issues in the current clinical settings: 1) short of clinical resources with the prevalence of ASD (1.7% in the United States), and 2) subjectivity of ASD screening. This work differentiates itself with three unique features: First, it proposes an ASD screening with privileged modality framework that integrates information from two behavioral modalities during training and improves the performance on each single modality at testing. The proposed framework does not require overlap in subjects between the modalities. Second, it develops the first computational model to classify people with ASD using a photo-taking task where subjects freely explore their environment in a more ecological setting. Photo-taking reveals attentional preference of subjects, differentiating people with ASD from healthy people, and is also easy to implement in real-world clinical settings without requiring advanced diagnostic instruments. Third, this study for the first time takes advantage of the temporal information in eye movements while viewing images, encoding more detailed behavioral differences between ASD people and healthy controls. Experiments show that our ASD screening models can achieve superior performance, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. Moreover, our framework using diverse modalities demonstrates performance improvement on both the photo-taking and image-viewing tasks, providing a general paradigm that takes in multiple sources of behavioral data for a more accurate ASD screening. The framework is also applicable to various scenarios where one-to-one pairwise relationship is difficult to obtain across different modalities.",123974342,University of Minnesota,Saint Paul,United States,"['1712', '1707']",25.6,0.22036564625850338,0.49098639455782306,1
141,141,3D scene reconstruction with multi-layer depth and epipolar transformers,"We tackle the problem of automatically reconstructing a complete 3D model of a scene from a single RGB image. This challenging task requires inferring the shape of both visible and occluded surfaces. Our approach utilizes viewer-centered, multi-layer representation of scene geometry adapted from recent methods for single object shape completion. To improve the accuracy of view-centered representations for complex scenes, we introduce a novel 'Epipolar Feature Transformer' that transfers convolutional network features from an input view to other virtual camera viewpoints, and thus better covers the 3D scene geometry. Unlike existing approaches that first detect and localize objects in 3D, and then infer object shape using category-specific models, our approach is fully convolutional, end-to-end differentiable, and avoids the resolution and memory limitations of voxel representations. We demonstrate the advantages of multi-layer depth representations and epipolar feature transformers on the reconstruction of a large database of indoor scenes.",60019647,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,United States,"['1712', '1707']",24.5,0.09964285714285716,0.41154761904761905,1
142,142,Algebraic characterization of essential matrices and their averaging in multiview settings,"Essential matrix averaging, i.e., the task of recovering camera locations and orientations in calibrated, multiview settings, is a first step in global approaches to Euclidean structure from motion. A common approach to essential matrix averaging is to separately solve for camera orientations and subsequently for camera positions. This paper presents a novel approach that solves simultaneously for both camera orientations and positions. We offer a complete characterization of the algebraic conditions that enable a unique Euclidean reconstruction of n cameras from a collection of (n-2) essential matrices. We next use these conditions to formulate essential matrix averaging as a constrained optimization problem, allowing us to recover a consistent set of essential matrices given a (possibly partial) set of measured essential matrices computed independently for pairs of images. We finally use the recovered essential matrices to determine the global positions and orientations of the n cameras.

While we now have tools to automatically recognize the clothing and style attributes of what people are wearing in these photographs, we lack the ability to analyze spatial and temporal trends in these attributes or make predictions about the future. In this paper we address this need by providing an automatic framework that analyzes large corpora of street imagery to (a) discover and forecast long-term trends of various fashion attributes as well as automatically discovered styles, and (b) identify spatio-temporally localized events that affect what people wear. We show that our framework makes long term trend forecasts that are > 20% more accurate than prior art, and identifies hundreds of socially meaningful events that impact fashion across the globe.",60007776,Cornell University,Ithaca,United States,"['1712', '1707']",31.8,0.17125850340136056,0.39787414965986395,1
144,144,Delving deep into hybrid annotations for 3D human recovery in the wild,"Though much progress has been achieved in single-image 3D human recovery, estimating 3D model for in-the-wild images remains a formidable challenge. The reason lies in the fact that obtaining high-quality 3D annotations for in-the-wild images is an extremely hard task that consumes enormous amount of resources and manpower. To tackle this problem, previous methods adopt a hybrid training strategy that exploits multiple heterogeneous types of annotations including 3D and 2D while leaving the efficacy of each annotation not thoroughly investigated. In this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive study on cost and effectiveness trade-off between different annotations. Specifically, we focus on the challenging task of in-the-wild 3D human recovery from single images when paired 3D annotations are not fully available. Through extensive experiments, we obtain several observations: 1) 3D annotations are efficient, whereas traditional 2D annotations such as 2D keypoints and body part segmentation are less competent in guiding 3D human recovery. 2) Dense Correspondence such as DensePose is effective. When there are no paired in-the-wild 3D annotations available, the model exploiting dense correspondence can achieve 92% of the performance compared to a model trained with paired 3D data. We show that incorporating dense correspondence into in-the-wild 3D human recovery is promising and competitive due to its high efficiency and relatively low annotating cost. Our model trained with dense correspondence can serve as a strong reference for future research.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,"['1712', '1707']",23.0,0.09185374149659864,0.3933078231292516,1

These networks may focus on different tasks and in many cases are optimized for different datasets. In this paper, we study how to exploit such heterogeneous pre-trained networks, known as teachers, so as to train a customized student network that tackles a set of selective tasks defined by the user. We assume no human annotations are available, and each teacher may be either single- or multi-task. To this end, we introduce a dual-step strategy that first extracts the task-specific knowledge from the heterogeneous teachers sharing the same sub-task, and then amalgamates the extracted knowledge to build the student network. To facilitate the training, we employ a selective learning scheme where, for each unlabelled sample, the student learns adaptively from only the teacher with the least prediction ambiguity. We evaluate the proposed approach on several datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that the student, learned by such adaptive knowledge amalgamation, achieves performances even better than those of the teachers.",60003970,Zhejiang University,Hangzhou,China,"['1712', '1707']",24.428571428571427,0.08109243697478992,0.44544817927170877,1
146,146,Chinese street view text: Large-scale chinese text reading with partially supervised learning,"Most existing text reading benchmarks make it difficult to evaluate the performance of more advanced deep learning models in large vocabularies due to the limited amount of training data. To address this issue, we introduce a new large-scale text reading benchmark dataset named Chinese Street View Text (C-SVT) with 430,000 street view images, which is at least 14 times as large as the existing Chinese text reading benchmarks. To recognize Chinese text in the wild while keeping large-scale datasets labeling cost-effective, we propose to annotate one part of the C-SVT dataset (30,000 images) in locations and text labels as full annotations and add 400,000 more images, where only the corresponding text-of-interest in the regions is given as weak annotations. To exploit the rich information from the weakly annotated data, we design a text reading network in a partially supervised learning framework, which enables to localize and recognize text, learn from fully and weakly annotated data simultaneously. To localize the best matched text proposals from weakly labeled images, we propose an online proposal matching module incorporated in the whole model, spotting the keyword regions by sharing parameters for end-to-end training. Compared with fully supervised training algorithms, this model can improve the end-to-end recognition performance remarkably by 4.03% in F-score at the same labeling cost. The proposed model can also achieve state-of-the-art results on the ICDAR 2017-RCTW dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed partially supervised learning framework.",60112903,"Baidu, Inc.",Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707']",33.857142857142854,0.08770712046574117,0.4518808777429468,1

The generator consists of multiple progressive steps. At each step a shadow attention detector is firstly exploited to generate an attention map which specifies shadow regions in the input image. Given the attention map, a negative residual by a shadow remover encoder will recover a shadow-lighter or even a shadow-free image. The discriminator is designed to classify whether the output image in the last progressive step is real or fake. Moreover, ARGAN is suitable to be trained with a semi-supervised strategy to make full use of sufficient unsupervised data. The experiments on four public datasets have demonstrated that our ARGAN is robust to detect both simple and complex shadows and to produce more realistic shadow removal results.

However, its standard formulation with a hard margin only leverages part of the training data in each mini-batch. Moreover, the margin is often empirically chosen or determined through computationally expensive validation, and stays unchanged during the entire training session. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to overcome the above limitations. The core idea is to replace the hard margin with a non-parametric soft margin, which is dynamically updated. The major observation is that the difficulty of a triplet can be inferred from the cumulative distribution function of the triplets' signed distances to the decision boundary. We demonstrate through experiments on both real-valued and binary local feature descriptors that our method leads to state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks, while eliminating the need to determine the best margin.",60003269,Princeton University,Princeton,United States,"['1712', '1707']",21.0,0.08112745098039216,0.43032212885154064,1

We coined the algorithm deep step patterns, in short DeepSPa. Most existing deep learning based methods require a set of manually labeled training data with known corresponding spatial transformations, which limits the size of training datasets. By contrast, our method is fully automatic and scale well to different image modalities with no human intervention. We generate feature classes from simple step patterns within patches of connecting edges formed by vascular junctions in multiple retinal imaging modalities. We leverage CNN to learn and optimize the input patches to be used for image registration. Spatial transformations are estimated based on the output possibility of the fully connected layer of CNN for a pair of images. One of the key advantages of the proposed algorithm is its robustness to non-linear intensity changes, which widely exist on retinal images due to the difference of acquisition modalities. We validate our algorithm on extensive challenging datasets comprising poor quality multimodal retinal images which are adversely affected by pathologies (diseases), speckle noise and low resolutions.

To this end, we propose an efficient approach to exploit a compact but accurate model in a backbone architecture for each instance of all tasks. The proposed method consists of an estimator and a selector. The estimator is based on a backbone architecture and structured hierarchically. It can produce multiple different network models of different configurations in a hierarchical structure. The selector chooses a model dynamically from a pool of candidate models given an input instance. The selector is a relatively small-size network consisting of a few layers, which estimates a probability distribution over the candidate models when an input instance of a task is given. Both estimator and selector are jointly trained in a unified learning framework in conjunction with a sampling-based learning strategy, without additional computation steps. We demonstrate the proposed approach for several image classification tasks compared to existing approaches performing model selection or learning multiple tasks. Experimental results show that our approach gives not only outstanding performance compared to other competitors but also the versatility to perform instance-wise model selection for multiple tasks.",60120116,Automation and Systems Research Institute,Seoul,South Korea,"['1712', '1707']",19.3,0.048214285714285716,0.3392857142857143,1

Yet, the number of object-level categories annotated in detection datasets is an order of magnitude smaller than image-level classification labels. State-of-the art object detection models are trained in a supervised fashion and this limits the number of object classes they can detect. In this paper, we propose a novel weight transfer network (WTN) to effectively and efficiently transfer knowledge from classification network's weights to detection network's weights to allow detection of novel classes without box supervision. We first introduce input and feature normalization schemes to curb the under-fitting during training of a vanilla WTN. We then propose autoencoder-WTN (AE-WTN) which uses reconstruction loss to preserve classification network's information over all classes in the target latent space to ensure generalization to novel classes. Compared to vanilla WTN, AE-WTN obtains absolute performance gains of 6% on two Open Images evaluation sets with 500 seen and 57 novel classes respectively, and 25% on a Visual Genome evaluation set with 200 novel classes.",60005510,Nanyang Technological University,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1707']",25.571428571428573,0.14047619047619048,0.4328042328042328,1

We callse features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous scales omni-scale features. In this paper, a novel deep ReID CNN is designed, termed Omni-Scale Network (OSNet), for omni-scale feature learning. This is achieved by designing a residual block composed of multiple convolutional feature streams, each detecting features at a certain scale. Importantly, a novel unified aggregation gate is introduced to dynamically fuse multi-scale features with input-dependent channel-wise weights. To efficiently learn spatial-channel correlations and avoid overfitting, the building block uses both pointwise and depthwise convolutions. By stacking such blocks layer-by-layer, our OSNet is extremely lightweight and can be trained from scratch on existing ReID benchmarks.

153,153,Bridging the domain gap for ground-to-aerial image matching,"The visual entities in cross-view (e.g. ground and aerial) images exhibit drastic domain changes due to the differences in viewpoints each set of images is captured from. Existing state-of-the-art methods address the problem by learning view-invariant images descriptors. We propose a novel method for solving this task by exploiting the gener- ative powers of conditional GANs to synthesize an aerial representation of a ground-level panorama query and use it to minimize the domain gap between the two views. The synthesized image being from the same view as the ref- erence (target) image, helps the network to preserve im- portant cues in aerial images following our Joint Feature Learning approach. We fuse the complementary features from a synthesized aerial image with the original ground- level panorama features to obtain a robust query represen- tation. In addition, we employ multi-scale feature aggre- gation in order to preserve image representations at dif- ferent scales useful for solving this complex task.

However, 'casual' photos of documents are usually unsuitable for automatic information extraction, mainly due to physical distortion of the document paper, as well as various camera positions and illumination conditions. In this work, we propose DewarpNet, a deep-learning approach for document image unwarping from a single image. Our insight is that the 3D geometry of the document not only determines the warping of its texture but also causes the illumination effects. Therefore, our novelty resides on the explicit modeling of 3D shape for document paper in an end-to-end pipeline. Also, we contribute the largest and most comprehensive dataset for document image unwarping to date - Doc3D.

155,155,3Dpeople: Modeling the geometry of dressed humans,"Recent advances in 3D human shape estimation build upon parametric representations that model very well the shape of the naked body, but are not appropriate to represent the clothing geometry. In this paper, we present an approach to model dressed humans and predict their geometry from single images. We contribute in three fundamental aspects of the problem, namely, a new dataset, a novel shape parameterization algorithm and an end-to-end deep generative network for predicting shape. First, we present 3DPeople, a large-scale synthetic dataset with 2 Million photo-realistic images of 80 subjects performing 70 activities and wearing diverse outfits. Besides providing textured 3D meshes for clothes and body we annotated the dataset with segmentation masks, skeletons, depth, normal maps and optical flow. All this together makes 3DPeople suitable for a plethora of tasks. We then represent the 3D shapes using 2D geometry images. To build these images we propose a novel spherical area-preserving parameterization algorithm based on the optimal mass transportation method. We show this approach to improve existing spherical maps which tend to shrink the elongated parts of the full body models such as the arms and legs, making the geometry images incomplete. Finally, we design a multi-resolution deep generative network that, given an input image of a dressed human, predicts his/her geometry image (and thus the clothed body shape) in an end-to-end manner.

156,156,Mono-SF: Multi-view geometry meets single-view depth for monocular scene flow estimation of dynamic traffic scenes,"Existing 3D scene flow estimation methods provide the 3D geometry and 3D motion of a scene and gain a lot of interest, for example in the context of autonomous driving. These methods are traditionally based on a temporal series of stereo images. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular 3D scene flow estimation method, called Mono-SF. Mono-SF jointly estimates the 3D structure and motion of the scene by combining multi-view geometry and single-view depth information. Mono-SF considers that the scene flow should be consistent in terms of warping the reference image in the consecutive image based on the principles of multi-view geometry. For integrating single-view depth in a statistical manner, a convolutional neural network, called ProbDepthNet, is proposed. ProbDepthNet estimates pixel-wise depth distributions from a single image rather than single depth values. Additionally, as part of ProbDepthNet, a novel recalibration technique for regression problems is proposed to ensure well-calibrated distributions. Our experiments show that Mono-SF outperforms state-of-the-art monocular baselines and ablation studies support the Mono-SF approach and ProbDepthNet design.",60015776,Robert Bosch GmbH,Gerlingen,Germany,"['1712', '1707']",18.88888888888889,0.10142857142857145,0.4257142857142857,1

158,158,Learning to rank proposals for object detection,"Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is an essential step of modern object detection models for removing duplicated candidates. The efficacy of NMS heavily affects the final detection results. Prior works exploit suppression criterions relying on either the objectiveness derived from classification or the overlapness produced by regression, both of which are heuristically designed and fail to explicitly link with the suppression rank. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model to produce the suppression rank via a learning procedure, thus facilitating the candidate generation and lifting the detection performance. In particular, we define a ranking score based on IoU to indicate the ranks of candidates during the NMS step, where candidates with high ranking score will be reserved and the ones with low ranking score will be eliminated. We design a lightweight network to predict the ranking score. We introduce a ranking loss to supervise the generation of these ranking scores, which encourages candidates with IoU to the ground-truth to rank higher. To facilitate the training procedure, we design a novel sampling strategy via dividing candidates into different levels and select hard pairs to adopt in the training. During the inference phase, this module can be exploited as a plugin to the current object detector. The training and inference of the overall framework is end-to-end.

By contrast, inference in a deep network, requiring a single forward pass, is much faster. Taking advantage of this, we propose a novel architecture to fit a 3D garment template to a 3D body. Specifically, we build upon the recent progress in 3D point cloud processing with deep networks to extract garment features at varying levels of detail, including point-wise, patch-wise and global features. We fuse these features with those extracted in parallel from the 3D body, so as to model the cloth-body interactions. The resulting two-stream architecture, which we call as GarNet, is trained using a loss function inspired by physics-based modeling, and delivers visually plausible garment shapes whose 3D points are, on average, less than 1 cm away from those of a PBS method, while running 100 times faster. Moreover, the proposed method can model various garment types with different cutting patterns when parameters of those patterns are given as input to the network.",60028186,Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne,Lausanne,Switzerland,"['1712', '1707']",25.857142857142858,0.03199404761904764,0.3727678571428571,1

Inspired by a student learning in a classroom, we present an agent that can continuously learn by posing natural language questions to humans. Our agent is composed of three interacting modules, one that performs captioning, another that generates questions and a decision maker that learns when to ask questions by implicitly reasoning about the uncertainty of the agent and expertise of the teacher. As compared to current active learning methods which query images for full captions, our agent is able to ask pointed questions to improve the generated captions. The agent trains on the improved captions, expanding its knowledge.

Different from previous work in this area, we choose to operate in a realistic and difficult setting where: (i) the number of characters is not known a priori; and (ii) face tracks belonging to minor or background characters are not discarded. To this end, we propose Ball Cluster Learning (BCL), a supervised approach to carve the embedding space into balls of equal size, one for each cluster. The learned ball radius is easily translated to a stopping criterion for iterative merging algorithms. This gives BCL the ability to estimate the number of clusters as well as their assignment, achieving promising results on commonly used datasets.

162,162,Stochastic exposure coding for handling multi-tof-camera interference,"As continuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras become popular in 3D imaging applications, they need to contend with the problem of multi-camera interference (MCI). In a multi-camera environment, a ToF camera may receive light from the sources of other cameras, resulting in large depth errors. In this paper, we propose stochastic exposure coding (SEC), a novel approach for mitigating. SEC involves dividing a camera's integration time into multiple slots, and switching the camera off and on stochastically during each slot. This approach has two benefits. First, by appropriately choosing the on probability for each slot, the camera can effectively filter out both the AC and DC components of interfering signals, thereby mitigating depth errors while also maintaining high signal-to-noise ratio. This enables high accuracy depth recovery with low power consumption. Second, this approach can be implemented without modifying the C-ToF camera's coding functions, and thus, can be used with a wide range of cameras with minimal changes. We demonstrate the performance benefits of SEC with theoretical analysis, simulations and real experiments, across a wide range of imaging scenarios.",60032179,University of Wisconsin-Madison,Madison,United States,"['1712', '1707']",19.555555555555557,0.11796428571428572,0.4508452380952381,1

Specifically, the network is represented by two graphs, i.e., Object-Bodypart Graph and Human-Bodypart Graph. Here, the Object-Bodypart Graph dynamically captures the relationship between body parts and the surrounding objects. The Human-Bodypart Graph infers the relationship between human and body parts, and assembles body part contexts to predict actions. These two graphs are associated through an action passing mechanism. The proposed RPNN model is able to implicitly parse a pairwise relation in two graphs without supervised labels.

164,164,HAWQ: Hessian aware quantization of neural networks with mixed-precision,"Model size and inference speed/power have become a major challenge in the deployment of neural networks for many applications. A promising approach to address these problems is quantization. However, uniformly quantizing a model to ultra-low precision leads to significant accuracy degradation. A novel solution for this is to use mixed-precision quantization, as some parts of the network may allow lower precision as compared to other layers. However, there is no systematic way to determine the precision of different layers. A brute force approach is not feasible for deep networks, as the search space for mixed-precision is exponential in the number of layers. Another challenge is a similar factorial complexity for determining block-wise fine-tuning order when quantizing the model to a target precision. Here, we introduce Hessian AWare Quantization (HAWQ), a novel second-order quantization method to address these problems. HAWQ allows for the automatic selection of the relative quantization precision of each layer, based on the layer's Hessian spectrum. Moreover, HAWQ provides a deterministic fine-tuning order for quantizing layers. We show the results of our method on Cifar-10 using ResNet20, and on ImageNet using Inception-V3, ResNet50 and SqueezeNext models. Comparing HAWQ with state-of-the-art shows that we can achieve similar/better accuracy with 8√ó activation compression ratio on ResNet20, as compared to DNAS, and up to 1% higher accuracy with up to 14% smaller models on ResNet50 and Inception-V3, compared to recently proposed methods of RVQuant and HAQ.

Extensive experiments on the vatex dataset show that, first, the unified multilingual model can not only produce both English and Chinese descriptions for a video more efficiently, but also offer improved performance over the monolingual models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal video context can be effectively utilized to align source and target languages and thus assist machine translation.

In this work, we propose to learn a joint latent representation that leverages other modalities as weak labels to boost the RGB-based hand pose estimator. By design, our architecture is highly flexible in embedding various diverse modalities such as heat maps, depth maps and point clouds. In particular, we find that encoding and decoding the point cloud of the hand surface can improve the quality of the joint latent representation.

168,168,Self-supervised deep depth denoising,"Depth perception is considered an invaluable source of information for various vision tasks. However, depth maps acquired using consumer-level sensors still suffer from non-negligible noise. This fact has recently motivated researchers to exploit traditional filters, as well as the deep learning paradigm, in order to suppress the aforementioned non-uniform noise, while preserving geometric details. Despite the effort, deep depth denoising is still an open challenge mainly due to the lack of clean data that could be used as ground truth. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional deep autoencoder that learns to denoise depth maps, surpassing the lack of ground truth data. Specifically, the proposed autoencoder exploits multiple views of the same scene from different points of view in order to learn to suppress noise in a self-supervised end-to-end manner using depth and color information during training, yet only depth during inference. To enforce self-supervision, we leverage a differentiable rendering technique to exploit photometric supervision, which is further regularized using geometric and surface priors. As the proposed approach relies on raw data acquisition, a large RGB-D corpus is collected using Intel RealSense sensors. Complementary to a quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-supervised denoising approach on established 3D reconstruction applications.

Our model consists of a deep image generation neural network that learns to synthesize clothing conditioned on learned per-garment encodings. The latent encodings are explicitly factorized according to shape and texture, thereby allowing direct edits for both fit/presentation and color/patterns/material, respectively. We show how to bootstrap Web photos to automatically train a fashionability model, and develop an activation maximization-style approach to transform the input image into its more fashionable self.

To address this and other limitations, we introduce Attribute Manipulation Generative Adversarial Networks (AMGAN) for fashion images. While AMGAN's generator network uses class activation maps (CAMs) to empower its attention mechanism, it also exploits perceptual losses by assigning reference (target) images based on attribute similarities. AMGAN incorporates an additional discriminator network that focuses on attribute-relevant regions to detect unrealistic translations. Additionally, AMGAN can be controlled to perform attribute manipulations on specific regions such as the sleeve or torso regions.

It is an important problem in practice that is, for example, encountered in autonomous driving. In order to gain robustness to such changes, long-term localization approaches often use segmantic segmentations as an invariant scene representation, as the semantic meaning of each scene part should not be affected by seasonal and other changes. However, these representations are typically not very discriminative due to the very limited number of available classes. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network, the Fine-Grained Segmentation Network (FGSN), that can be used to provide image segmentations with a larger number of labels and can be trained in a self-supervised fashion. In addition, we show how FGSNs can be trained to output consistent labels across seasonal changes.

We use dilated convolution to extract multi-scale image features, which allows our single model to simultaneously handle multiple JPEG compression levels.

Our proposed objective however leads to a non-convex optimization problem, to which we resort to Riemannian optimization schemes and derive an efficient conjugate gradient scheme on the Stiefel manifold. To study the effectiveness of our scheme, we propose a new dataset Dash-Cam-Pose, consisting of clips with skeleton poses of humans seated in a car, the task being to classify the clips as normal or abnormal; the latter is when any human pose is out-of-position with regard to say an airbag deployment.

Here, we propose a new two-stream CNN architecture for semantic segmentation that explicitly wires shape information as a separate processing branch, i.e. shape stream, that processes information in parallel to the classical stream. Key to this architecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the two streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical stream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively removing noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the relevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow architecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution. Our experiments show that this leads to a highly effective architecture that produces sharper predictions around object boundaries and significantly boosts performance on thinner and smaller objects.

For the reasons above, we propose the Occlusion-shared and Feature-separated Network (OFNet). On one hand, considering the relevance between edge and orientation, two sub-networks are designed to share the occlusion cue. On the other hand, the whole network is split into two paths to learn the high semantic features separately. Moreover, a contextual feature for orientation prediction is extracted, which represents the bilateral cue of the foreground and background areas.

To reduce the amount of data required, we propose a new method for transferring prior knowledge of the pre-trained generator, which is trained with a large dataset, to a small dataset in a different domain. Using such prior knowledge, the model can generate images leveraging some common sense that cannot be acquired from a small dataset. In this work, we propose a novel method focusing on the parameters for batch statistics, scale and shift, of the hidden layers in the generator. By training only these parameters in a supervised manner, we achieved stable training of the generator, and our method can generate higher quality images compared to previous methods without collapsing, even when the dataset is small (‚àº100). Our results show that the diversity of the filters acquired in the pre-trained generator is important for the performance on the target domain. Our method makes it possible to add a new class or domain to a pre-trained generator without disturbing the performance on the original domain.

Besides an encoder-decoder branch for predicting point labels, we construct an edge branch to hierarchically integrate point features and generate edge features. To incorporate point features in the edge branch, we establish a hierarchical graph framework, where the graph is initialized from a coarse layer and gradually enriched along the point decoding process. For each edge in the final graph, we predict a label to indicate the semantic consistency of the two connected points to enhance point prediction. At different layers, edge features are also fed into the corresponding point module to integrate contextual information for message passing enhancement in local regions. The two branches interact with each other and cooperate in segmentation.

To tackle these challenges, we represent images by 'hyperpixels' that leverage a small number of relevant features selected among early to late layers of a convolutional neural network. Taking advantage of the condensed features of hyperpixels, we develop an effective real-time matching algorithm based on Hough geometric voting.

In this work, we present perhaps the first approach for predicting a future 3D mesh model sequence of a person from past video input. We do this for periodic motions such as walking and also actions like bowling and squatting seen in sports or workout videos. While there has been a surge of future prediction problems in computer vision, most approaches predict 3D future from 3D past or 2D future from 2D past inputs. In this work, we focus on the problem of predicting 3D future motion from past image sequences, which has a plethora of practical applications in autonomous systems that must operate safely around people from visual inputs. Inspired by the success of autoregressive models in language modeling tasks, we learn an intermediate latent space on which we predict the future. This effectively facilitates autoregressive predictions when the input differs from the output domain.

For the reconstruction of node features, the decoder is designed based on Laplacian sharpening as the counterpart of Laplacian smoothing of the encoder, which allows utilizing the graph structure in the whole processes of the proposed autoencoder architecture. In order to prevent the numerical instability of the network caused by the Laplacian sharpening introduction, we further propose a new numerically stable form of the Laplacian sharpening by incorporating the signed graphs.

We train a CNN on small subsets of training images, each mimicking the few-shot setting. In each subset, one image serves as the query and the other(s) as support image(s) with ground-truth segmentation. The CNN first extracts feature maps from the query and support images. Then, a class feature vector is computed as an average of the support's feature maps over the known foreground. Finally, the target object is segmented in the query image by using a cosine similarity between the class feature vector and the query's feature map. We make two contributions by: (1) Improving discriminativeness of features so their activations are high on the foreground and low elsewhere; and (2) Boosting inference with an ensemble of experts guided with the gradient of loss incurred when segmenting the support images in testing.

Our algorithm operates inductively by using the temporal model resulting from past observations to infer an instance segmentation of a new scan, which is then used to update the temporal model.

Traditional approaches use pairwise or higher order handcrafted geometric features to get robust matching; this requires solving NP-hard assignment problems. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a graph neural network model to transform coordinates of feature points into local features.

A reoccurring challenge is how to enable a model to generate a rich variety of samples from the entire target distribution, rather than only from a distribution confined to the training data. In other words, we would like the generative model to go beyond the observed samples and learn to generate ''unseen'', yet still plausible, data. In our work, we present CompoNet, a generative neural network for 2D or 3D shapes that is based on a part-based prior, where the key idea is for the network to synthesize shapes by varying both the shape parts and their compositions. Treating a shape not as an unstructured whole, but as a (re-)composable set of deformable parts, adds a combinatorial dimension to the generative process to enrich the diversity of the output, encouraging the generator to venture more into the ''unseen''. We show that our part-based model generates richer variety of plausible shapes compared with baseline generative models.

Few-shot segmentation has thus been developed to learn to perform segmentation from only a few annotated examples. In this paper, we tackle the challenging few-shot segmentation problem from a metric learning perspective and present PANet, a novel prototype alignment network to better utilize the information of the support set. Our PANet learns class-specific prototype representations from a few support images within an embedding space and then performs segmentation over the query images through matching each pixel to the learned prototypes. With non-parametric metric learning, PANet offers high-quality prototypes that are representative for each semantic class and meanwhile discriminative for different classes. Moreover, PANet introduces a prototype alignment regularization between support and query. With this, PANet fully exploits knowledge from the support and provides better generalization on few-shot segmentation.

By imposing the adversarial losses and combinable mapping mechanism in a multi-task structure, the proposed framework elegantly integrates the two separate stages of reflection generation and separation into a unified model. The gradient constraint is incorporated into the concurrent training process of the multi-task learning as well. In particular, we built up an unpaired reflection dataset with 4,027 images, which is useful for facilitating the weakly-supervised learning of reflection removal model.

In this paper, we propose a new training paradigm called Guided Complement Entropy (GCE) that is capable of achieving 'adversarial defense for free,' which involves no additional procedures in the process of improving adversarial robustness. In addition to maximizing model probabilities on the ground-truth class like cross-entropy, we neutralize its probabilities on the incorrect classes along with a 'guided' term to balance between these two terms. We show in the experiments that our method achieves better model robustness with even better performance compared to the commonly used cross-entropy training objective.

Instead, we predict a distortion correction flow map that encodes a per-pixel displacement that removes distortion artifacts when applied to the input image. Our method also automatically infers missing facial features, i.e. occluded ears caused by strong perspective distortion, with coherent details. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art both qualitatively and quantitatively, particularly for portraits with extreme perspective distortion or facial expressions.

201,201,Miss detection vs. false alarm: Adversarial learning for small object segmentation in infrared images,"A key challenge of infrared small object segmentation (ISOS) is to balance miss detection (MD) and false alarm (FA). This usually needs ''opposite'' strategies to suppress the two terms, and has not been well resolved in the literature. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial learning framework to improve this situation. Departing from the tradition of jointly reducing MD and FA via a single objective, we decompose this difficult task into two sub-tasks handled by two models trained adversarially, with each focusing on reducing either MD or FA. Such a new design brings forth at least three advantages. First, as each model focuses on a relatively simpler sub-task, the overall difficulty of ISOS is somehow decreased. Second, the adversarial training of the two models naturally produces a delicate balance of MD and FA, and low rates for both MD and FA could be achieved at Nash equilibrium. Third, this MD-FA detachment gives us more flexibility to develop specific models dedicated to each sub-task. To realize the above design, we propose a conditional Generative Adversarial Network comprising of two generators and one discriminator. Each generator strives for one sub-task, while the discriminator differentiates the three segmentation results from the two generators and the ground truth. Moreover, in order to better serve the sub-tasks, the two generators, based on context aggregation networks, utilzse different size of receptive fields, providing both local and global views of objects for segmentation. As verified on multiple infrared image data sets, our method consistently achieves better segmentation than many state-of-the-art ISOS methods.",60025709,The University of Sydney,Sydney,Australia,"['1712', '1707']",21.333333333333332,0.008279220779220768,0.3445988906926407,1

Its challenges originate from the large word variance in the text domain as well as the difficulty of accurately measuring the distance between the features of the two modalities. Most prior work focuses on the latter challenge, by introducing loss functions that help the network learn better feature representations but fail to account for the complexity of the textual input. With that in mind, we introduce TIMAM: A Text-Image Modality Adversarial Matching approach that learns modality-invariant feature representations using adversarial and cross-modal matching objectives. In addition, we demonstrate that BERT, a publicly-available language model that extracts word embeddings, can successfully be applied in the text-to-image matching domain.

By the nature of the problem, available cues (e.g. video frame(s) with object masks) become richer with the intermediate predictions. However, the existing methods are unable to fully exploit this rich source of information. We resolve the issue by leveraging memory networks and learn to read relevant information from all available sources. In our framework, the past frames with object masks form an external memory, and the current frame as the query is segmented using the mask information in the memory. Specifically, the query and the memory are densely matched in the feature space, covering all the space-time pixel locations in a feed-forward fashion. Contrast to the previous approaches, the abundant use of the guidance information allows us to better handle the challenges such as appearance changes and occlussions.

204,204,Learning with unsure data for medical image diagnosis,"In image-based disease prediction, it can be hard to give certain cases a deterministic ''disease/normal' label due to lack of enough information, eg, at its early stage. We call such cases ''unsure' data. Labeling such data as unsure suggests follow-up examinations so as to avoid irreversible medical accident/loss in contrast to incautious prediction. This is a common practice in clinical diagnosis, however, mostly neglected by existing methods. Learning with unsure data also interweaves with two other practical issues: (i) data imbalance issue that may incur model-bias towards the majority class, and (ii) conservative/aggressive strategy consideration, ie, the negative (normal) samples and positive (disease) samples should NOT be treated equally - the former should be detected with a high precision (conservativeness) and the latter should be detected with a high recall (aggression) to avoid missing opportunity for treatment. Mixed with these issues, learning with unsure data becomes particularly challenging.

205,205,"MVP matching: A maximum-value perfect matching for mining hard samples, with application to person re-identification","How to correctly stress hard samples in metric learning is critical for visual recognition tasks, especially in challenging person re-ID applications. Pedestrians across cameras with significant appearance variations are easily confused, which could bias the learned metric and slow down the convergence rate. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted complete bipartite graph based maximum-value perfect (MVP) matching for mining the hard samples from a batch of samples. It can emphasize the hard positive and negative sample pairs respectively, and thus relieve adverse optimization and sample imbalance problems. We then develop a new batch-wise MVP matching based loss objective and combine it in an end-to-end deep metric learning manner. It leads to significant improvements in both convergence rate and recognition performance. Extensive empirical results on five person re-ID benchmark datasets, i.e., Market-1501, CUHK03-Detected, CUHK03-Labeled, Duke-MTMC, and MSMT17, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

In this paper, we tackle the more realistic scenario where unexpected objects of unknown classes can appear at test time. The main trends in this area either leverage the notion of prediction uncertainty to flag the regions with low confidence as unknown, or rely on autoencoders and highlight poorly-decoded regions. Having observed that, in both cases, the detected regions typically do not correspond to unexpected objects, in this paper, we introduce a drastically different strategy: It relies on the intuition that the network will produce spurious labels in regions depicting unexpected objects. Therefore, resynthesizing the image from the resulting semantic map will yield significant appearance differences with respect to the input image. In other words, we translate the problem of detecting unknown classes to one of identifying poorly-resynthesized image regions. We show that this outperforms both uncertainty- and autoencoder-based methods.",60028186,Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne,Lausanne,Switzerland,"['1712', '1707']",23.285714285714285,0.06862745098039215,0.5450980392156862,1

Suffering from the high predictability with non-visual information, relationship models tend to fit the statistical bias rather than ''learning' to infer the relationships from images. To encourage further development in visual relationships, we propose a novel method to mine more valuable relationships by automatically pruning visually-irrelevant relationships. We construct a new scene graph dataset named Visually-Relevant Relationships Dataset (VrR-VG) based on Visual Genome. Compared with existing datasets, the performance gap between learnable and statistical method is more significant in VrR-VG, and frequency-based analysis does not work anymore. Moreover, we propose to learn a relationship-aware representation by jointly considering instances, attributes and relationships. By applying the representation-aware feature learned on VrR-VG, the performances of image captioning and visual question answering are systematically improved, which demonstrates the effectiveness of both our dataset and features embedding schema.

However, the majority of adversarial attacks assume global, fine-grained control over the image pixel space. In this paper, we consider a different setting: What happens if the adversary could only alter specific attributes of the input image? These would generate inputs that might be perceptibly different, but still natural-looking and enough to fool a classifier. We propose a novel approach to generate such ''semantic'' adversarial examples by optimizing a particular adversarial loss over the range-space of a parametric conditional generative model. We demonstrate implementations of our attacks on binary classifiers trained on face images, and show that such natural-looking semantic adversarial examples exist. We evaluate the effectiveness of our attack on synthetic and real data, and present detailed comparisons with existing attack methods.

We incorporate modern probabilistic deep learning methods that we further improve by using the gradients for these estimates. These have two-fold benefits: A) improvement in obtaining the certainty estimates that correlate better with misclassified samples and b) improved attention maps that provide state-of-the-art results in terms of correlation with human attention regions. The improved attention maps result in consistent improvement for various methods for visual question answering. Therefore, the proposed technique can be thought of as a recipe for obtaining improved certainty estimates and explanation for deep learning models.

Most of the large activity recognition datasets consist of data sourced from the web, which does not reflect challenges that exist in activities of daily living. In this paper, we introduce a large real-world video dataset for activities of daily living: Toyota Smarthome. The dataset consists of 16K RGB+D clips of 31 activity classes, performed by seniors in a smarthome. Unlike previous datasets, videos were fully unscripted. As a result, the dataset poses several challenges: High intra-class variation, high class imbalance, simple and composite activities, and activities with similar motion and variable duration. Activities were annotated with both coarse and fine-grained labels. These characteristics differentiate Toyota Smarthome from other datasets for activity recognition. As recent activity recognition approaches fail to address the challenges posed by Toyota Smarthome, we present a novel activity recognition method with attention mechanism. We propose a pose driven spatio-temporal attention mechanism through 3D ConvNets. We show that our novel method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, as well as on the Toyota Smarthome dataset.

Considering both low-level visual information and global class-level features that relate to this ambiguity, we propose a practical Latent Feature Guided Attribute Attention (LFGAA) framework to perform object-based attribute attention for semantic disambiguation.

The difficulty lies in that image segmentation has structured data representations, which yields a many-to-many message passing problem. Previous methods often simplify it to a one-to-many problem by squeezing support data to a global descriptor. However, a mixed global representation drops the data structure and information of individual elements. In this paper, we propose to model structured segmentation data with graphs and apply attentive graph reasoning to propagate label information from support data to query data. The graph attention mechanism could establish the element-to-element correspondence across structured data by learning attention weights between connected graph nodes. To capture correspondence at different semantic levels, we further propose a pyramid-like structure that models different sizes of image regions as graph nodes and undertakes graph reasoning at different levels.

215,215,Semantic-transferable weakly-supervised endoscopic lesions segmentation,"Weakly-supervised learning under image-level labels supervision has been widely applied to semantic segmentation of medical lesions regions. However, 1) most existing models rely on effective constraints to explore the internal representation of lesions, which only produces inaccurate and coarse lesions regions; 2) they ignore the strong probabilistic dependencies between target lesions dataset (e.g., enteroscopy images) and well-to-annotated source diseases dataset (e.g., gastroscope images). To better utilize these dependencies, we present a new semantic lesions representation transfer model for weakly-supervised endoscopic lesions segmentation, which can exploit useful knowledge from relevant fully-labeled diseases segmentation task to enhance the performance of target weakly-labeled lesions segmentation task. More specifically, a pseudo label generator is proposed to leverage seed information to generate highly-confident pseudo pixel labels by incorporating class balance and super-pixel spatial prior. It can iteratively include more hard-to-transfer samples from weakly-labeled target dataset into training set. Afterwards, dynamically-searched feature centroids for same class among different datasets are aligned by accumulating previously-learned features. Meanwhile, adversarial learning is also employed in this paper, to narrow the gap between the lesions among different datasets in output space. Finally, we build a new medical endoscopic dataset with 3659 images collected from more than 1100 volunteers.

However, most of the existing CNN-based hand pose estimation methods depend much on the training set, while labeling 3D hand pose on training data is laborious and time-consuming. Inspired by the point cloud autoencoder presented in self-organizing network (SO-Net), our proposed SO-HandNet aims at making use of the unannotated data to obtain accurate 3D hand pose estimation in a semi-supervised manner. We exploit hand feature encoder (HFE) to extract multi-level features from hand point cloud and then fuse them to regress 3D hand pose by a hand pose estimator (HPE). We design a hand feature decoder (HFD) to recover the input point cloud from the encoded feature. Since the HFE and the HFD can be trained without 3D hand pose annotation, the proposed method is able to make the best of unannotated data during the training phase. Experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets validate that our proposed SO-HandNet can achieve superior performance for 3D hand pose estimation via semi-supervised learning.",60032083,"University at Buffalo, The State University of New York",Buffalo,United States,"['1712', '1707']",25.428571428571427,0.4175,0.6083333333333334,1

Existing approaches solve this problem through iterative adversarial minimax optimization and lack theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we first study the ''linear' form of this problem i.e., the setting where all the players are linear functions. We show that the resulting optimization problem is both non-convex and non-differentiable. We obtain an exact closed-form expression for its global optima through spectral learning and provide performance guarantees in terms of analytical bounds on the achievable utility and invariance. We then extend this solution and analysis to non-linear functions through kernel representation. Numerical experiments on UCI, Extended Yale B and CIFAR-100 datasets indicate that, (a) practically, our solution is ideal for ''imparting' provable invariance to any biased pre-trained data representation, and (b) the global optima of the ''kernel' form can provide a comparable trade-off between utility and invariance in comparison to iterative minimax optimization of existing deep neural network based approaches, but with provable guarantees.",60071323,"Eastern Mediterranean University, Famagusta",Famagusta,Cyprus,"['1712', '1707']",25.571428571428573,0.174025974025974,0.4595238095238096,1

To realize a working GAN network, we construct an up-down-up expansion unit in the generator for upsampling point features with error feedback and self-correction, and formulate a self-attention unit to enhance the feature integration. Further, we design a compound loss with adversarial, uniform and reconstruction terms, to encourage the discriminator to learn more latent patterns and enhance the output point distribution uniformity.

This provides a fixed-dimensional embedding of the task that is independent of details such as the number of classes and requires no understanding of the class label semantics. We demonstrate that this embedding is capable of predicting task similarities that match our intuition about semantic and taxonomic relations between different visual tasks. We demonstrate the practical value of this framework for the meta-task of selecting a pre-trained feature extractor for a novel task. We present a simple meta-learning framework for learning a metric on embeddings that is capable of predicting which feature extractors will perform well on which task.

Since scene texts are high-level information invariant to illumination changes and very distinct for different places when considering spatial correlation, it is beneficial for visual place recognition tasks under extreme appearance changes and perceptual aliasing. It also takes spatial-temporal dependence between scene texts into account for topological localization.

A missing ingredient, however, is the ability to automatically evaluate point-wise importance w.r.t.! classification performance, which is usually reflected by a saliency map. A saliency map is an important tool as it allows one to perform further processes on point-cloud data. In this paper, we propose a novel way of characterizing critical points and segments to build point-cloud saliency maps. Our method assigns each point a score reflecting its contribution to the model-recognition loss. The saliency map explicitly explains which points are the key for model recognition. Furthermore, aggregations of highly-scored points indicate important segments/subsets in a point-cloud. Our motivation for constructing a saliency map is by point dropping, which is a non-differentiable operator. To overcome this issue, we approximate point-dropping with a differentiable procedure of shifting points towards the cloud centroid. Consequently, each saliency score can be efficiently measured by the corresponding gradient of the loss w.r.t the point under the spherical coordinates. Extensive evaluations on several state-of-the-art point-cloud recognition models, including PointNet, PointNet++ and DGCNN, demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposed saliency map.

230,230,Extension of strongin‚Äôs global optimization algorithm to a function continuous on a compact interval," Zabotin, Pavel A. ChernyshevskijThe Lipschitz continuous property has been used for a long time to solve the global optimization problem and continues to be used. Here we can mention the work of Piyavskii, Yevtushenko, Strongin, Shubert, Sergeyev, Kvasov and others. Most papers assume a priori knowledge of the Lipschitz constant, but the derivation of this constant is a separate problem. Further still, we must prove that an objective function is really Lipschitz, and it is a complicated problem too. In the case where the Lipschitz continuity is established, Strongin proposed an algorithm for global optimization of a satisfying Lipschitz condition on a compact interval function without any a priori knowledge of the Lipschitz estimate. The algorithm not only finds a global extremum, but it determines the Lipschitz estimate too. It is known that every function that satisfies the Lipchitz condition on a compact convex set is uniformly continuous, but the reverse is not always true. However, there exist models (Arutyunova, Dulliev, Zabotin) whose study requires a minimization of the continuous but definitely not Lipschitz function. One of the algorithms for solving such a problem was proposed by R. J. Vanderbei. In his work he introduced some generalization of the Lipchitz property named Œµ-Lipchitz and proved that a function defined on a compact convex set is uniformly continuous if and only if it satisfies the Œµ-Lipchitz condition. The above-mentioned property allowed him to extend Piyavskii‚Äôs method. However, Vanderbei assumed that for a given value of Œµ it is possible to obtain an associate Lipschitz Œµ-constant, which is a very difficult problem. Thus, there is a need to construct, for a function continuous on a compact convex domain, a global optimization algorithm which works in some way like Strongin‚Äôs algorithm, i.e., without any a priori knowledge of the Lipschitz Œµ-constant. In this paper we propose an extension of Strongin‚Äôs global optimization algorithm to a function continuous on a compact interval using the Œµ-Lipchitz conception, prove its convergence and solve some numerical examples using the software that implements the developed method.",60088527,Kazan National Research Technical University named after A.

Linguistic scales of fuzzy characteristics (interval age and the occurrence of signs) and certainty factors should contribute to a more subtle and accurate evaluation of diagnostically significant traits and increase the effectiveness of diagnosis at different ages. The measure of confidence is determined with respect to each characteristic used for a given nosological form.

These approaches are, although working well, fail to exploit the satisfied accuracy for specific object detection or many methods sacrifice the accuracy for the speed of real-time detection. The reason for the unsatisfied results is that the relationship between the various objects is not effectively considered. In this paper, we propose a decisive fusion network for object detection. After the network extracts the features from the backbone first, the last five layers are treated as the feature pyramid structure. Each layer is responsible for the bounding box by the border regression algorithm, and the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm is responsible for the classification of the target. The fusion function connects the DQN algorithm with the object detection network, and considers the selection relationship between objects through the DQN algorithm to improve the overall accuracy.

In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework for multi-camera vehicle detection, tracking and reidentification in complex traffic environments with urban multijunctions, which integrates visual features and temporal-spatial information of the trajectories for optimization. Based on detection and tracking of multi-vehicles in a single camera, our method distinguishes and marks the vehicle trajectories from different intersections where they enter and exit. Then, the visual features of the same vehicle keyframes are extracted to match between the cameras of the specific matching link, while taking into account the constraint of the trajectory time. In the end, our algorithm shortens vehicle trajectories' average matching time in two cameras to 2 seconds, and the accuracy is 81.59% in the test scenarios, which greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of vehicle re-identification.",60000937,Shenzhen University,Shenzhen,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",31.8,0.018831168831168834,0.2571428571428572,1

However, ScSR will result in obvious blockeffect because of the block preprocessing of the image. For this purpose, Zeiler et al. proposed convolutional sparse coding based SR (CSC-SR) method to solve this problem. Because it needs to learn two groups of filters and mapping function between HR and LR feature maps, CSC-SR usually puts forward high demand to storage and relatively large the calculation expense. In this paper, we propose a modified CSC-SR method to single image superresolution.

243,243,Linear and nonlinear optimization models of multiple covering of a bounded plane domain with circles," Galiev, Alexander V. KhorkovProblems of multiple covering (k-covering) of a bounded set G with equal circles of a given radius are well known. They are thoroughly studied under the assumption that G is a finite set. There are several papers concerned with studying this problem in the case where G is a connected set. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the number of circles that form a k-covering, k ‚â• 1, provided that G is a bounded convex plane domain. For the above-mentioned problem, we state a 0-1 linear model, a general integer linear model, and a nonlinear model, imposing a constraint on the minimum distance between the centers of covering circles. The latter constraint is due to the fact that in practice one can place at most one device at each point. We establish necessary and sufficient solvability conditions for the linear models and describe one (easily realizable) variant of these conditions in the case where the covered set G is a rectangle. We propose some methods for finding an approximate number of circles of a given radius that provide the desired k-covering of the set G, both with and without constraints on distances between the circles‚Äô centers. We treat the calculated values as approximate upper bounds for the number of circles. We also propose a technique that allows one to get approximate lower bounds for the number of circles that is necessary for providing a k-covering of the set G. In the general linear model, as distinct from the 0-1 linear model, we require no additional constraint. The difference between the upper and lower bounds for the number of circles characterizes the quality (acceptability) of the constructed k-covering. We state a nonlinear mathematical model for the k-covering problem with the above-mentioned constraints imposed on distances between the centers of covering circles. For this model, we propose an algorithm which (in certain cases) allows one to find more exact solutions to covering problems than those calculated from linear models. For implementing the proposed approach, we have developed computer programs and performed numerical experiments. Results of numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",60088527,Kazan National Research Technical University named after A. N.

Yet, design flaws are often documented with natural language and require a manual analysis, which is inefficient. Besides low-level vulnerability databases (e.g., CWE, CAPEC) there is little systematized knowledge on security design flaws. The purpose of this work is to present and evaluate a catalog of security design flaws accompanied by inspection guidelines for their detection. To this aim, we conduct empirical studies with master and doctoral students.

252,252,Towards creation of a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems,"With progressing digitalization and the trend towards autonomous computing, systems tend to form digital ecosystems, where each autonomous system aims at achieving its own goals. Within a highway ecosystem, for example, autonomous vehicles could deploy smart agents in the form of software applications. This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that. In this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships.

In this task, how to keep the global consistency across dynamic scenes and characters in the story flow is the distinct difference from other single-image works, which is also a significant challenge. However, the visual quality and semantic relevance of existing results are not satisfying when handling datasets with high semantic complexity, such as Pororo-SV cartoon dataset. To address this issue, we propose a new story visualization model named PororoGAN, which jointly considers story-to-imagesequence, sentence-to-image and word-to-image-patch alignment. In particular, we introduce ASE (aligned sentence encoder) and AWE (attentional word encoder) to improve global and local relevance, respectively. Additionally, we add an image patches discriminator to improve the reality of results. Both quantitative and qualitative studies show that PororoGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art models.",60021427,Communication University of China,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",19.857142857142858,0.05086868686868687,0.32630303030303026,1
256,256,"Promoting social inclusion for migrant populations through media, technologies and languages","While the globalized nature of contemporary society can be empowering for many, it may mean the maintenance of social iniquities for others, such as migrant populations. Spain, like many other European countries, has faced a high migration influx in the last decades. As a result, the government has invested in measures orientated toward social inclusion for these populations, including policies for the acquisition of language and culture. To support these efforts, the aim of the present study is twofold: Firstly, to evaluate the design of a cloud-based platform which supports learning authentic language and culture material appearing in media. Secondly, to present the results of a group of 12 trainers teaching language and culture courses through the platform and 63 adult A2-B1 migrants taking the courses offered there.

257,257,Optimizing energy consumption for cloud computing: A cluster and migration based approach (CMBA),"The increased use of IT technologies and number of IT users have triggered cloud computing resource demand including the need for more data centers. Each data center consumes electricity for its un-interrupted operations and maintenance, therefore responsible for the emissions of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas causing climate change. Hence, there is a necessity to provide a solution through which energy consumption for cloud data centers can be reduced. As virtual machine located in data center are run under loaded to maintain higher performance but it causes wastage of resources and power. While, task overloading severally reduce the performance of data center. To address this issue, we propose CMBA (Cluster and Migration Based Approach) for cloud resource allocation that maps groups of tasks to customized virtual machine types based on processing, memory and network requirements. Proper placement of workload with specific VMs and dynamic migration concept reduce energy consumption for running physical machine and its respective host or data centers. Taking altogether, intelligent customization of virtual machines by adopting CMBA approach will maintain high efficiency of datacenters with reduced energy consumption.",60010953,Donghua University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.75,0.14066666666666666,0.294968253968254,1

261,261,Understanding Public Response to Air Quality Using Tweet Analysis,"Poor air quality is recognized as a major risk factor for human health globally. Critical to addressing this important public-health issue is the effective dissemination of air quality data, information about adverse health effects, and the necessary mitigation measures. However, recent studies have shown that even when public get data on air quality and understand its importance, people do not necessarily take actions to protect their health or exhibit pro-environmental behaviors to address the problem. Most existing studies on public attitude and response to air quality are based on offline studies, with a limited number of survey participants and over a limited number of geographical locations. For a larger survey size and a wider set of locations, we collected Twitter data for a period of nearly 2 years and analyzed these data for three major cities: Paris, London, and New Delhi. We identify the three hashtags in each city that best correlate the frequency of tweets with local air quality. Using tweets with these hashtags, we determined that people‚Äôs response to air quality across all three cities was nearly identical when considering relative changes in air pollution. Using machine-learning algorithms, we determined that health concerns dominated public response when air quality degraded, with the strongest increase in concern being in New Delhi, where pollution levels are the highest among the three cities studied. The public call for political solutions when air quality worsens is consistent with similar findings with offline surveys in other cities. We also conducted an unsupervised learning analysis to extract topics from tweets in Delhi and studied their evolution over time and with changing air quality. Our analysis helped extract relevant words or features associated with different air quality‚Äìrelated topics such as air pollution policy and health. Also, the topic modeling analysis revealed niche topics associated with sporadic air quality events, such as fireworks during festivals and the air quality impact on an outdoor sport event. Our approach shows that a tweet-based analysis can enable social scientists to probe and survey public response to events such as air quality in a timely fashion and help policy makers respond appropriately.",60026227,Clarkson University,Potsdam,United States,['1706'],27.076923076923077,0.09765414765414765,0.40188662688662696,1

There is more than enough evidence of both voluntary and forced migration, which may be the result of pull factors like search for better livelihood options and push factors like natural disasters, a failed monsoon and the consequent famine, Poverty and indebtedness are the most important factors that lead to migration. Workers migrating within a country usually move from less developed regions to more developed ones. Kerala has been one of the most promising destinations for migrants from north and north-east India mainly due to the higher earning potential and lesser harassment by the authorities. The devastating floods of August 2018 led to the complete disruption in the lives of these migrant workers.

267,267,Isotropic multidimensional catalytic branching random walk with regularly varying tails," BulinskayaThe study completes a series of the author‚Äôs works devoted to the spread of particles population in supercritical catalytic branching random walk (CBRW) on a multidimensional lattice. The CBRW model describes the evolution of a system of particles combining their random movement with branching (reproduction and death) which only occurs at fixed points of the lattice. The set of such catalytic points is assumed to be finite and arbitrary. In the supercritical regime the size of population, initiated by a parent particle, increases exponentially with positive probability. The rate of the spread depends essentially on the distribution tails of the random walk jump. If the jump distribution has ‚Äúlight tails‚Äù, the ‚Äúpopulation front‚Äù, formed by the particles most distant from the origin, moves linearly in time and the limiting shape of the front is a convex surface. When the random walk jump has independent coordinates with a semiexponential distribution, the population spreads with a power rate in time and the limiting shape of the front is a star-shape nonconvex surface. So far, for regularly varying tails (‚Äúheavy‚Äù tails), we have considered the problem of scaled front propagation assuming independence of components of the random walk jump. Now, without this hypothesis, we examine an ‚Äúisotropic‚Äù case, when the rate of decay of the jumps distribution in different directions is given by the same regularly varying function. We specify the probability that, for time going to infinity, the limiting random set formed by appropriately scaled positions of population particles belongs to a set B containing the origin with its neighborhood, in Rd. In contrast to the previous results, the random cloud of particles with normalized positions in the time limit will not concentrate on coordinate axes with probability one.",60002049,Novosibirsk State University,Novosibirsk,Russian Federation,"['1706', '1703']",26.181818181818183,-0.07843822843822844,0.46022951407566787,0

However, with growing emergence of knowledge economy, the traditional valuation methods has been put into question due to the non-inclusion of Human capital as a major part of firm‚Äôs total value in balance sheet. The value of Human Resources in an organization should be measured for sustainable growth of the organization since it plays the role of motivational tool, efficiency measure yardstick and cost clarification. Human Resource Accounting (HRA) measures and reports the value of employees in B/S which helps management take strategic decisions related to human resources in order to enhance efficiency and productivity.

Different from conventional setups, the scenario considered in this paper has prioritized data sources, where the hot data has higher priority than cold data in the decoding process. It is assumed that a user demanding cold data demands hot data as well. Instead of using same capacity for all storage nodes, the rate regions of interest are all feasible different storage sizes versus different tuples of source entropies, with assumption of sufficient large repair bandwidth. Both symmetric and asymmetric repairs are discussed in the paper. Linear network codes over some finite field are said to be sufficient for such a distributed storage system if and only if for every point in the rate region, there exists a code over that finite field to achieve it. As a multi-source multi-sink network coding problem, the rate regions are obtained from computer-aided approaches via bounding the region of entropic vectors.

In this paper, a semantic matching model based on optimal selection mechanism is designed. Compared with other models that without using an optimal feature selection mechanism, the model uses optimal features that are closest to the original semantics to match, resulting in higher matching. This paper proposes an improved semantic information selection mechanism. This mechanism selects a candidate feature that is as close as possible to the semantics of the original text by calculating the probability of distribution of semantic information in the sentence. Furthermore, a new attention focus mechanism is designed, which iteratively updates the information weight to obtain another candidate feature that may affect the matching accuracy. Then, an optimal feature selection algorithm is designed by using the context vector and two candidate features. The coefficients are selected, and the optimal features are further selected from the candidate features for semantic matching.

281,281,Risk assessment and quantification of wealthsurance equity growth fund of IdBI federal life insurance,"The objective of risk management is not to prohibit or prevent risk taking activity, but to ensure that the risks are consciously taken with full knowledge, clear purpose and thorough understanding so that it can be measured and mitigated. It also prevents an institution from suffering unacceptable loss causing it to fail or materially damage its competitive position. Balancing risk and return is not an easy task as risk is subjective and not quantifiable whereas return is objective and measurable. This paper includes both qualitative and quantitative research. The former uses a survey, face-to-face discussions and telephonic interviews on study sample which helped to decipher the demographics and the financial needs of the clientele. The latter uses empirical data sources to gauge the risks associated with a unit-linked insurance plan (ULIP), wealthsurance equity growth fund of IDBI federal life insurance based on risk parameters. A regression analysis is performed on the 5 year monthly historical data of portfolio returns of wealthsurance equity growth fund of IDBI federal life insurance and market returns. The findings suggest that the portfolio returns are almost independent of market returns thereby involving a high amount of risk for the fund managers to take to provide better returns.

282,282,Overset grids approach for topography modeling in elastic-wave modeling using the grid-characteristic method," Khokhlov, Vladislav O. Stetsyuk, Ivan A. MitskovetsWhile modeling seismic wave propagation, it is important to take into account nontrivial topography, as this topography causes multiple complex phenomena, such as diffraction at rough surfaces, complex propagation of Rayleigh waves, and side effects caused by wave interference. The primary goal of this research is to construct a method that implements the free surface on topography, utilizing an overset curved grid for characterization, while keeping the main grid structured rectangular. For a combination of the regular and curve-linear grid, the workability of the grid characteristics method using overset grids (also known as the Chimera grid approach) is analyzed. One of the benefits of this approach is computational complexity reduction, caused by the fact that simulation in a regular, homogeneous physical area using a sparse regular rectangle grid is simpler. The simplification of the mesh building mechanism (one grid is regular, and the other can be automatically built using surface data) is a side effect. Despite its simplicity, the method we propose allows us to increase the digitalization of fractured regions and minimize the Courant number. This paper contains various comparisons of modeling results produced by the proposed method-based solver, and results produced by the well-known solver specfem2d, as well as previous modeling results for the same problems. The drawback of the method is that an interpolation error can worsen an overall model accuracy and reduce the computational schema order. Some countermeasures against it are described. For this paper, only two-dimensional models are analyzed. However, the method we propose can be applied to the three-dimensional problems with minimal adaptation required.",60000308,Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1706', '1703']",20.53846153846154,0.00795454545454546,0.34775224775224767,0

The widespread transmission of massive power information using data mining techniques for large amounts of data can yield valuable information. Therefore, hacker attacks are endless, posing a threat to the security of the state, society, collectives and individuals. In this paper, we propose a secure transmission scheme of power information, named ""SSD"" (Split & Signature & Disturbing). In the scheme, after the data is split, it will be anonymized and selected for different paths to be transferred to the destination node. After recombination, the data will be restored. The SSD ensures the indistinguishability and security of the sensitive data by data splitting and disturbing method, and protects the anonymity of individual identities by group signature.

289,289,Application of mathematical fracture models to simulation of exploration seismology problems by the grid-characteristic method," Muratov, Igor B. PetrovIn real problems of exploration seismology we deal with a heterogeneity of the nature of elastic waves interaction with the surface of a fracture by the propagation through it. The fracture is a complex heterogeneous structure. In some locations the surfaces of fractures are placed some distance apart and are separated by filling fluid or emptiness, in some places we can observe the gluing of surfaces, when under the action of pressure forces the fracture surfaces are closely adjoined to each other. In addition, fractures can be classified by the nature of saturation: fluid or gas. Obviously, for such a large variety in the structure of fractures, one cannot use only one model that satisfies all cases. This article is concerned with description of developed mathematical fracture models which can be used for numerical solution of exploration seismology problems using the grid-characteristic method on unstructured triangular (in 2D-case) and tetrahedral (in 3D-case) meshes. The basis of the developed models is the concept of an infinitely thin fracture, whose aperture does not influence the wave processes in the fracture area. These fractures are represented by bound areas and contact boundaries with different conditions on contact and boundary surfaces. Such an approach significantly reduces the consumption of computer resources since there is no need to define the mesh inside the fracture. On the other side, it allows the fractures to be given discretely in the integration domain, therefore, one can observe qualitatively new effects, such as formation of diffractive waves and multiphase wave front due to multiple reflections between the surfaces of neighbor fractures, which cannot be observed by using effective fracture models actively used in computational seismology. The computational modeling of seismic waves propagation through layers of mesofractures was produced using developed fracture models.

The digitalization is achieved by connecting different entities (machines, worker) to data-exchange, which needs to be dynamic and to adapt to different changing situations and members in the process. However, just exchanging data might lead to confidentiality issues. The data-exchange needs to be protected to secure the confidentiality and trust in the system. Therefore, security rules need to adapt to these dynamic situations. One part of a possible solution might be dynamic access control rules. However in many cases, existing ""legacy"" systems are reused, which can in not handle dynamic access control rules. Due to this gap between the required and provided functionality, we propose an approach, which integrates dynamic access control based on the system-context into legacy systems.

Konyukhov, Anatolii N. ChekalinThe mathematical model, finite-difference schemes and algorithms for computation of transient thermo- and hydrodynamic processes involved in commissioning the unified system including the oil producing well, electrical submersible pump and fractured-porous reservoir with bottom water are developed. These models are implemented in the computer package to simulate transient processes with simultaneous visualization of their results along with computations. An important feature of the package Oil-RWP is its interaction with the special external program GCS which simulates the work of the surface electric control station and data exchange between these two programs. The package Oil-RWP sends telemetry data and current parameters of the operating submersible unit to the program module GCS (direct coupling). The station controller analyzes incoming data and generates the required control parameters for the submersible pump. These parameters are sent to Oil-RWP (feedback). Such an approach allows us to consider the developed software as the ‚ÄúIntellectual Well System‚Äù. Some principal results of the simulations can be briefly presented as follows. The transient time between inaction and quasi-steady operation of the producing well depends on the well stream watering, filtration and capacitive parameters of oil reservoir, physical-chemical properties of phases and technical characteristics of the submersible unit. For the large time solution of the nonstationary equations governing the nonsteady processes is practically identical to the inverse quasi-stationary problem solution with the same initial data.

Such methods have problems such as high computational dimensions, sparse data, and inability to take advantage of the semantic information contained in the text itself, so the results obtained are not as similar as the physical text. The text similarity model based on the topic model changes the traditional spatial similarity of keyword vectors, and can fully utilize the semantic information contained in the text itself. But this approach ignores the effect of words on text semantic representations with different weights. In the process of converting text into topic feature space, valuable information is lost. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a text similarity hybrid model (L-THM) integrating LDA and TF-IDF for calculating text similarity. The model uses the semantic information contained in the text itself and the keyword information reflecting the text to comprehensively analyses and calculates the similarity between the texts. The experimental results show that the hybrid model can better represent the text information than the single model, and obtain a good F value in the cluster, which effectively improves the text similarity calculation effect.",60022422,Ocean University of China,Qingdao,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",26.375,0.1420408163265306,0.4855102040816326,1
305,305,A hedge algebras based fuzzy inference system for clustering in multi-hop WSNs,"To prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks, the clustering technique is a key point to create optimized sensor node groups for effective transmission processes. There are many factors affected the efficiency of clustering algorithms that come from uncertain characteristics of both inside and outside network conditions. Therefore, the fuzzy logic-based clustering technique can be seen as a promising technique since it allows combining and evaluating diverse parameters in an efficient sense. Moreover, the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is an efficient modeling tool to utilize the best input data features and expert knowledge for supporting appropriate decisions. However, using the human reasoning process to assign linguistic terms for setting fuzzy rules may lead to ineffective results because of intuitively heavily dependent problem.

307,307,Application of the grid-characteristic method for mathematical modeling in dynamical problems of deformable solid mechanics," PetrovThe grid-characteristic method is a promising numerical method for solving hyperbolic systems of equations, e.g., equations describing elastic and acoustic waves. This method has high precision and allows physically correct simulations of wave processes in heterogeneous media. The grid-characteristic method makes it possible to correctly take into account boundary conditions and conditions on surfaces with different physical characteristics. The method offers the greatest advantages for one-dimensional equations, especially in combination with a fixed difference grid, as in conventional grid-based methods. However, in the multidimensional case using the algorithms of splitting with respect to spatial variables, the author has managed to preserve its positive qualities. The use of the method of Runge ‚Äì Kutta type, or the integro-interpolation method for hyperbolic equations makes it possible to effectively carry out a generalization of methods developed for linear equations, in the nonlinear case, in particular, to enforce the difference analogs of the conservation laws, which is important for shock-capturing, for example, discontinuous solutions. Based on the author‚Äôs variant of the grid-characteristic method, several important problems of seismic prospecting, seismic resistance, global seismic studies on Earth and Mars, medical applications, nondestructive testing of railway lines, the simulation of the creation and characteristics of composite materials for the aerospace industry and other areas of practical application were numerically solved. A significant advantage of the constructed method is the preservation of its stability and precision at the strains of the environment.

In this paper, we present a deep adversarial learning based architecture for one-class classification. Our architecture is composed of two deep neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are competing while collaborating with each other since it is inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generator network contains a Deconvolutional Neural Networks (aka. decoder), which is trained using a zero-centered Gaussian noise as the feature representation of the pseudo-negative class to learn a good representation as well as the boundary for the classifiable distortion of the target (or positive) class with the assistance from the target class. The outputs produced by the generator network are aggregated with the real positive class data samples, which are then used to train the discriminator network, whose goal is to understand the underlying concept in the positive class, and then classify the negative testing samples. The proposed architecture applies to a variety of OCC problems such as novelty detection, anomaly detection, and mobile user authentication.

Labeling highquality medical entities from Chinese medical texts plays an important role in named entity recognition, and construction of medical knowledge graph. Named entity annotation in medical texts is the premise of the full-supervised and semi-supervised named entities recognition. The current mainstream named entity annotation require a lot of manpower on the corpus labeling, which is laborious and time consuming. For medical entities widely distributed in Chinese medical texts, in this paper, we propose a small number of manually labeled medical entities to autonomously learn medical text features, and iteratively generating new labeled entities. The model automatically iterates the annotations from the original medical text collection to be processed and generates a valid medical entity. The autonomously medical entity labeling work makes it easy to label Chinese medical texts. This framework is tested on real Chinese medical records, and the experimental results show that the method can effectively identify the entities, and has certain practical value.",60014966,Peking University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.0,0.08246366728509587,0.23961811997526278,1
311,311,Source-code divergence diagnosis using constraints and cryptography,"This paper presents a new technique that informs developers of potential architectural-type violations and non-compliance checking in their software system after changes in the source code. The violations identified by our technique not only concern broken calls/dependencies/inheritance or data-dependencies but also concern the dissatisfaction of some constraints which may be defined and imposed by OCL. The technique partitions the software system into small grain nodes and filters out nodes that have no role in dependency-based software architecture adherence and nodes that cannot jeopardize the validity of a function regarding OCL adherence. It thus presents a reduced version of the source code where additional developer-defined links may be established between entities (e.g., method to method) based on the developer's implicit knowledge of the architecture of the system. A change in, for example, an assignment expression would 1) single out the containing entity of the node(s) (e.g., method or class), and 2) issue an alert to all of the linked entities. To establish the link/call/chain, we suggest using an architecture consistency chain technology (inspired by blockchain).",60009602,University of Limerick,Limerick,Ireland,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",29.0,-0.0975108225108225,0.5781385281385282,1
312,312,Semi-automatic mapping of source code using naive Bayes,The software industry has not adopted continuous use of static architecture conformance checking. One hindrance is the needed mapping from source code elements to elements of the architecture. We present a novel approach of generating and combining dependency and semantic information extracted from an initial set of mapped source code files. We use this to train a Naive Bayes classifier that is then used to map the remainder of the source code files. We compare this approach with the HuGMe technique on six open source projects with known mappings. We find that our approach provides an average performance improvement of 0.22 and an average precision and recall F1-score improvement of 0.26 in comparison to HuGMe.,60108011,"Linnaeus University, V√§xj√∂",Vaxjo,Sweden,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",19.166666666666668,-0.014285714285714282,0.45714285714285713,1

316,316,Real-time online multi-object tracking: A joint detection and tracking framework,"In recent years, object detection technology has been continuously developed, and the tracking-by-detection strategy has gradually become the main method of multi-object tracking. Based on detection, the accuracy of the multi-object tracking depends on the detection results to a large extent. However, in many practical applications, especially the case of complex scenes and crowded objects, the detection results are usually inaccurate. In this paper, a joint detection and tracking framework is proposed with a unified confidence scoring function to evaluate tracks confidence and complement low confidence detections with high confidence tracks. In this way, detections and tracks can be combined organically and achieved complementarity. High confidence detection results can prevent long-term tracking drift, while high confidence tracking prediction can deal with false detection and missed detection caused by occlusion during object interaction. Moreover, we trained the ReID appearance feature with higher identification capabilities on the large-scale person reidentification datasets, which has higher identification capability.

Therefore, the impact on the future automobile industry is particularly significant, forcing the auto industry to carry out reforms again and again. In the near future, people's transportation will move toward fully-automobile driving, and will soon become the normal state of human life in the future. The development of 5G will also make human life more successful in the transformation. In view of this, the research will use the case study method to conduct an inductive analysis of the technology required for driverless driving and 5G technology.

Such bad decisions are called Architectural Smells (AS) and should be detected as soon as possible, because their presence heavily hinders the maintainability and evolvability of the software. Many detection approaches rely on software analysis techniques which inspect the structure of the system under analysis and check with rules the presence of AS. However, some recent approaches leverage natural language processing techniques to recover semantic information from the system. This kind of information is useful to detect AS which violate ""conceptual"" design principles, such as the separation of concerns one. In this research study, I propose two detection strategies for AS detection based on code2vec, a neural model which is able to predict semantic properties of given snippets of code.",60012306,University of Milano - Bicocca,Milan,Italy,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",23.166666666666668,0.030769230769230792,0.5006410256410256,1

Although model-driven approaches allow abstracting microservices behavior from the business domain, there is a lack of proper methods for addressing the referred challenges. In this paper, the elicitation of microservices, their identification uses using functionally decomposed UML use cases as input within a logical architecture derivation method, namely an adapted version of the Four Step Rule Set (4SRS), using SoaML diagrams, that responds to microservices specific characteristics.

320,320,A framework for managing uncertainty in software architecture,"Software architecture records key decisions about software systems. Changes to architecture decisions can, therefore, have significant costs. One of the main causes of architecture changes is uncertainty, which is an inherent feature in open, real-world software systems. We hypothesise that capturing uncertainties, as far as they can be predicted, pertaining to structure, behaviour and resources of systems in software architecture and treating them as first-class concerns, would make architecture decisions more resilient to change. Explicitly considering and representing uncertainty in architecture can help developers design for change and minimise architecture erosion as changes invariably occur. In this PhD project, we aim to develop a conceptual framework for the management of uncertainty in software architecture. The conceptual framework will be realised in the form of a workbench of tools for managing uncertainty at the architectural level. The effectiveness of the framework and the workbench will be evaluated using case studies. An ideal case study for evaluation will demonstrate different aspects of uncertainty in software architecture.

However, when it comes to multicore support or massive parallel execution the approaches still suffer from major drawbacks. Drawbacks include inaccurate prediction models, insufficient modelling languages, and missing tool support, to name just some of them.

However, such approaches are often difficult to learn and apply and thus have not found their way into mainstream software development. Controlled natural languages (CNLs) seek to overcome the drawbacks of formal approaches by hiding their formality behind a restricted set of natural language, which is intended to be easier to use. In this paper, we analyze the applicability of CNLs for automated architecture analysis and as a means for architecture documentation in an industrial case study. We evaluated the CNL with 12 experienced practitioners in a focus group. The results show that practitioners perceive CNLs as an appropriate and an understandable means for formalizing and documenting architectural rules.

For the widely distributed entities, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end named entity extraction framework, which uses popular deep learning based approach, known as conditional random field (CRF), bidirectional-long short-term memory (Bi- LSTM+CRF) and BERT+Bi-LSTM+CRF for training and testing the named entities. These models are tested on real medical records, and the experimental results show that the method can effectively identify the entities, and has certain practical value.",60014966,Peking University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.833333333333332,0.07301587301587302,0.3817460317460318,1
334,334,Reinforcement learning based on multi-subnet clusters,"The main task of reinforcement learning is to enable the subject to obtain the most reward from the environment. Reinforcement learning has been proposed and achieved certain results. However, many reinforcement learning methods still have inefficiencies that result in inability to meet the demand in some applications. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposed a reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-subnet cluster (MSC-RL). The proposed network consists of multiple subnet clusters and the primary storage network. Each subnet cluster is composed of multiple subnets and one sub-storage network. In the subnet cluster, multiple subnets are used to explore the solution space simultaneously and saves the searched information to the sub-storage network. At regular intervals, the subnet cluster saves the searched information to the primary storage network. In traditional reinforcement learning, there is not enough interaction between the independent subnets. Insufficient information interaction between the independent subnets can cause the algorithm to fall into local optimum. MSC-RL can exchange information searched by each subnet through the sub-storage network to realize information interaction within the subnet cluster. Each cluster uses the primary storage network for information interaction. The method enhances the information interaction between subnets and improves the ability of the algorithm to optimize. This paper uses the Atari game to verify the performance of the proposed method and compared it with some mainstream reinforcement learning methods. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to some mainstream reinforcement learning methods in the performance of the Atari game.",60108756,Hubei University of Technology,Wuhan,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",16.6,0.13540372670807455,0.36587036152253555,1

When trained, it is not limited to the existing classified datasets and video datasets. Second, similar to RNN, its shared convolutional layers extract the generic image features by calculating the pixel relationship maps of the pixels between the first pixel and the N th pixel, instead of just adjacent pixels. Through comparative experiments, We prove that the convolutional layers of Gated PixelCNN are not inferior to convolutional layers in traditional trackers. In this paper, we employ this new kind of convolutional layers in tracking. In addition, Particle Filtration is introduced in our algorithm to increase the tracker's resilience to occlusions.

The objective of this study is to get an insight into the purchase behavior of the residential solar roof top adopters in the city of Chennai, South India. The study is based on primary data which was collected using a questionnaire. This RSRTPV adopter centric research of 105 respondents was conducted in the city of Chennai in South India. A structured, undisguised, questionnaire with 46 preselected questions was adopted after pilot testing. The length of the survey questionnaire was kept optimum with close-ended questions based on Likert scale to elicit quick responses, by the sampled adopters. The demographic variables of the respondents indicate the green profile of a PV adopter. The study reveals their domestic consumption details like the nature of RSRTPV system, its size, type of installation, roof top area, type of dwelling and the financial option of the consumers etc. reflecting the characteristic status of RSRTPV installations. The study concludes that consumers‚Äô experience, purchase behavior, knowledge of technology, its beneficial effects, accessible information on installations and customized financing options are vital inputs for aggressive market development of RSRTPV. The study also concludes that residential solar roof top segment remains the least developed, with its small transaction size, lower tariff and less third-party ownership. The study identifies the need for consumer awareness to translate into interest in and adoption of RSRTPV. Chennai has 8.69 million population, while it has only 350 MW of roof top solar, which implies that the offtake is poor owing to loans and subsidies, not being nattractive to induce adoption.

Unlike traditional optical character recognition (OCR), words in natural images often possess irregular layout (e.g. arbitrarily orientation, blurring, perspective distortion) which are difficult to recognize. In this paper, we develop a novel method consisting of a text recognition network and a text correction component, which is more robust to irregular text. The text correction component rectify the text of an input image to a more ""readable"" text. The text recognition network is a more ""location aware"" attentionbased sequence learning model that take the rectified image as input and recognize the text. The entire networks are trained jointly by only images and word-level annotations. The standard Softmax loss function only considers the separability between classes but does not restrict the aggregation within classes.

354,354,The afterlife of discarded woollens: Who is recycling my clothes?,"Purpose- This photo shoot aims to document and understand the process, present scenario, facilities and workers condition of wool recycling units in Panipat, a small town in northern part of India. The city emerged as the recycling hub when the owners of Panipat mills bought second-hand machines from Prato, Italy and started recycling wool and producing shoddy yarn. Panipat is acknowledged as the ‚Äúcast off capital‚Äù and is a part of recycling $182 million value of worn clothes imported to India annually. Methodology- In total, 5 wool recycling units were visited for studying the processes and taking photographs. 20 unstructured interviews of workers, 5 unstructured interviews of factory owners, factory managers/ labor contractors each were conducted. Findings- The findings were categorized into three subheads: The processes, Worker condition and the present scenario. The process of recycling has been same since the inception. With the industry mainly driven by the unorganized sector, there is a lack of investment from the owners towards machinery up -gradation and worker well-being. The economic and social aspect of sustainability is lacking in the whole system. Poor working conditions, lowest worker wages and workers prone to respiratory disorders is the other face of the industry that is doing good to the planet by recycling waste. The industry is on the decline due to competition from the lightweight polyester blanket, almost of the same price, softer in hand feel and of better aesthetics. Large amounts of clothing lie without processing due to the slump in demand. The price of imports per kg has fallen by almost 3 times as compared to early 1990‚Äôs when it was approximately 50 Rs/kg to now at 16 Rs/kg now. The lightweight polyester substitute, excess supply of second-hand clothing and fall in demand of its recycled products posses many questions about the future of recycling fashion. This is a case where substitutes are cannibalizing sustainability efforts. Implications- The photos from this study have a direct implication on creating awareness of the social impact of overconsumption and over disposal. We need to think beyond eco-friendly disposal.

359,359,"The role of efl learners' autonomy, motivation and self-efficacy in using technologybased out-of-class language learning activities","This study aims to identify which technologybased out-of-class activities are more commonly used by Iranian efl learners outside language classrooms. Furthermore, it explored the relationship between the use of technologybased out-of-class language learning activities (tbocllas) by efl learners and three individual learner characteristics such as motivation, autonomy and self-efficacy. The participants of the study consisted of 100 Iranian efl learners who were asked to take part in the study by filling out four questionnaires regarding tbocllas, motivation, autonomy, and self-efficacy. The results revealed that among different tbocllas, receptive activities were relatively more frequent among learners than productive ones. Results also indicated that there was a strong positive correlation between technology-based out-ofclass language learning activities and Iranian efl learners' motivation levels. Moreover, it was found that there was a strong correlation between tbocllas and the efl learners' autonomy. In the same vein, the findings revealed a strong and statistically significant correlation between tbocllas and the learners' self-efficacy. Finally, the research findings suggested that learners' motivation, autonomy, and self-efficacy were all significantly contributing to the participants' use of technologybased out-of-class language learning activities. Among the above mentioned individual factors, motivation had the highest predictive value, and among self-efficacy and autonomy, the latter could better predict the use of tbocllas by the learners.",60118817,Majan University College,Muttrah,Oman,['1706'],23.333333333333332,0.17886363636363636,0.4985227272727273,1

In this experiment, the International Standard Picture Stimulation Library(IAPS) was used to induce positive and negative emotions of subjects, and EEG signals were collected when subjects were looking at pictures. Comparing the beta power of positive and negative EEG induced by before and after exercise, we found that the power of beta stimulated by positive and negative pictures before exercise is generally greater than that after exercise. It indicates that subjects were happier when facing positive stimuli than before exercise, and less negative emotions were produced when facing negative stimuli than before exercise. In short, acute moderate intensity exercise can improve people's negative emotion in the face of negative stimuli. The purpose of this study is to explore the mechanism of the effect of acute moderate intensity exercise on emotion by analyzing beta power in late positive potential (LPP).",60122052,Southwest University,Chongqing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",26.833333333333332,0.010521212121212122,0.4760242424242424,1

By integrating cloud computing applications and services into a complex existing system, many challenges arise, especially those related to security issues. In this paper, it is proposed a security framework to guide the planning and definition phases of security requirements for SoS considering agile methods for application development and a DevSecOps approach. By using a checklist and some questions to identify which security aspects should be included, security drivers were obtained to integrate cloud computing in a SoS context, taking into account the perspectives of existing IT Governance Model, IT Operational Model, and IT Processes.

Relation extraction is a classification task which uses pooling operations in neural networks to reduce dimensions and integration features and it uses regularization to prevent overfitting. This paper evaluates the performance of CNN and LSTM in Drug-drug interaction extraction. We discuss the models' performance differences using different pooling operations and regularization parameters. Firstly, regularization can prevent over-fitting effectively, but it is important to ensure that the regularization parameters are set within the correct ranges. Secondly, the max pooling is better than other single pooling methods.

366,366,Full-wave 3D earthquake simulation using the double-couple model and the grid-characteristic method," Bagaev, Vasily I. Golubev, Yulia A. GolubevaOne of the destroying natural processes is the initiation of the regional seismic activity. It leads to a large number of human deaths. Much effort has been made to develop precise and robust methods for the estimation of the seismic stability of buildings. One of the most common approaches is the natural frequency method. The obvious drawback of this approach is a low precision due to the model oversimplification. The other method is a detailed simulation of dynamic processes using the finite-element method. Unfortunately, the quality of simulations is not enough due to the difficulty of setting the correct free boundary condition. That is why the development of new numerical methods for seismic stability problems is a high priority nowadays. The present work is devoted to the study of spatial dynamic processes occurring in geological medium during an earthquake. We describe a method for simulating seismic wave propagation from the hypocenter to the day surface. To describe physical processes, we use a system of partial differential equations for a linearly elastic body of the second order, which is solved numerically by a grid-characteristic method on parallelepiped meshes. The widely used geological hypocenter model, called the ‚Äúdouble-couple‚Äù model, was incorporated into this numerical algorithm. In this case, any heterogeneities, such as geological layers with curvilinear boundaries, gas and fluid-filled cracks, fault planes, etc., may be explicitly taken into account. In this paper, seismic waves emitted during the earthquake initiation process are numerically simulated. Two different models are used: the homogeneous half-space and the multilayered geological massif with the day surface. All of their parameters are set based on previously published scientific articles. The adequate coincidence of the simulation results is obtained. And discrepancies may be explained by differences in numerical methods used. The numerical approach described can be extended to more complex physical models of geological media.",60000308,Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1706', '1703']",14.904761904761905,0.04124458874458875,0.38579895594601477,0

The growing use of long-lived IoT and CPS has made them susceptible to obsolescence and change, just like ""normal"" software, demanding systematic support for periodic updates of their embedded software. However, there is little empirical data about the structure, architecture, specifications, and dependencies of these subsystems. This article presents an analysis of over-the-air (OTA) update support in 26 existing open-source IoT/CPS operating systems and embedded software projects, performed primarily by examining their documentation and supplementing with occasional source code examination.

However, most of the standard transfer learning algorithms are designed to repeat the same method for fine-tuning of the weights on the target domain. If we try to investigate the human brain?s mechanism of learning a new complex concept based on a simple and basic concept, we can say, it is different from just the repetition of the same method of learning on a different dataset. In this article, we have introduced a novel transfer learning algorithm referred to as HTL (Hebbian transfer learning) using synaptic plasticity. The Hebbian theory, introduced by Donald Hebb, explains the ""associative learning"" in which the simultaneous activation of the brain cells positively affects the increase in the synaptic connection strength between the individual cells. This particular behaviour of Hebbian learning, makes it a very viable candidate for discriminative learning for the search of the specific feature for the task of object recognition or image classification. It helps connection weights of the learned model to adapt as per task dataset using numerical methods defining plasticity principles. Learning to discriminate between instances of different classes, over a variable number of classes within the dataset space defined by the task at hand, can be the result-oriented approach for classification problem. Extensive experiments verify that HTL, using synaptic plastic behaviour in heterogeneous transfer learning task does better than the standard state of the art methods of transfer learning on the cross-domain image classification task.",60009387,"Dongguk University, Seoul",Seoul,South Korea,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",27.77777777777778,0.10137741046831956,0.3488095238095238,1

384,384,Efficient Provision of Service Function Chains in Overlay Networks using Reinforcement Learning,"IEEESoftware-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) technologies facilitate deploying Service Function Chains (SFCs) at clouds in efficiency and flexibility. However, it is still challenging to efficiently chain Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in overlay networks without knowledge of underlying network configurations. Although there are many deterministic approaches for VNF placement and chaining, they have high complexity and depend on state information of substrate networks. Fortunately, Reinforcement Learning (RL) brings opportunities to alleviate this challenge as it can learn to make suitable decisions without prior knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an RL approach for efficient SFC provision in overlay networks, where the same VNFs provided by multiple vendors are with different performance. Specifically, we first formulate the problem into an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model for benchmarking.

387,387,Fast and Area Efficient Implementation of RSA Algorithm," All rights reserved.Efficient hardware implementations of public-key cryptosystems have been gaining interest in the past few decades. To achieve the goal, a high frequency as well as low latency Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem is reported in this paper. To configure such cryptosystem shift-add multiplier have been re-constructed and binary digit based modular exponentiation circuitry is proposed. Such exponentiation circuitry has been implemented through binary bit distribution technique, where, most significant bit (MSB) has been discarded for the implementation, owing to increase the operating frequency. The functionality of the reported algorithms were justified and compared in Hardware Description Language (HDL), simulated in Modelsim and synthesized in Xilinx ISE 14.2 platform. The proposed hardware implementation of RSA algorithm has a maximum frequency of operation of 545 MHz and 298 MHz for the bit sizes of 8 and 64 respectively. The proposed method shows improvements in terms of speed as well as in number of Look-up-tables (LUTs).

The main aim is to increase the accuracy and to report the manufacturer about the negatives of the product. The major problem is categorization of sentiment polarity, which is the problem of sentiment analysis. There are two levels of categorization and they are Review-level Categorization and Sentence-level Categorization. Categorization of review-level becomes arduous when we attempt to classify the reviews respect with their specific rating related to star-scaled. Second, Review-level Categorization has a drawback in Implicit-level sentiment analysis. Mostly SVM, Na√Øve Bayesian and Decision Tree are mainly used to improve the efficiency of classification.

PEI (polyethylenimines) are polymer molecules made up of amine groups and two aliphatic carbons, which are cyclically repeated. PEI are transfection reagents which, using positively charged units, bind well to anionic DNA residues. During the studies on GOX, PEI were used both in their linear and branched structures. Rhombellanes, RBL, are structures decorated with rhombs/squares. The aim of the paper is to study the interactions of two kinds of linear ligands: PEIs (Polyethylenimines) and CHRs (ethers of Hexahydroxy-cyclohexane) with the glucose oxidase enzyme, GOX (3QVR). To understand the structure-activity relationship between the GOX enzyme and the linear ligands PEI and CHR, two steps of docking simulation were performed; mapping the whole area of the 3QVR enzyme and docking on the first and second surface of the enzyme, separately. The studied ligands interacted with amino acids of GOX inside the protein and on its surface, with stronger and shorter bonds inside of the protein. However, long chain ligands can only interact with amino acids on the external protein surface.

In Steganography host image is destroyed and cannot be attained to the original state. In a sensitive area such as military and medical recovery of the original cover medium is required without any loss. A special case of data hiding that retrieves the cover media and secret information without a loss of a pixel is known as reversible data hiding. In this paper reversible data hiding technique is proposed to improve the security and enhance the capacity; a hybrid model of integer wavelet transform and Arnold transform are used. The cover image is decomposed into the integer wavelet sub-band; each sub-band is further scrambled using Arnold transform before embedding scrambled secret information.

Hash algorithms can provide such an authentication mechanism for IoT based applications. The most recent secure hash algorithm technique standardized by the NIST is SHA-3. SHA-3 is fully apt in ensuring authentication for a sender and receiver transaction. A novel signature generating technique based on SHA-3 is presented in the paper. Two of the popular IoT communication models of publish subscribe and request response are examined under this authentication scheme. The sender generates a unique hash code for the data that it is about to send. This hash code serves as the authenticating token for the transaction. Mechanisms for the sender receiver interaction are built into the program codes in both the simulated communication models. The system architecture also manages interaction of the receiver with the cloud. This interaction ensures proper authentication through the mechanisms and api(s) provided by the cloud service providers, and these mechanisms are also integrated into the simulation. Both the cloud services used in the system architecture, i.e. cloud messaging as a service, and cloud database as a service ensure that the sender's identity is verified.

395,395,Definable transformation to normal crossings over henselian fields with separated analytic structure,"We are concerned with rigid analytic geometry in the general setting of Henselian fields K with separated analytic structure, whose theory was developed by Cluckers-Lipshitz-Robinson. It unifies earlier work and approaches of numerous mathematicians. Separated analytic structures admit reasonable relative quantifier elimination in a suitable analytic language. However, the rings of global analytic functions with two kinds of variables seem not to have good algebraic properties such as Noetherianity or excellence. Therefore, the usual global resolution of singularities from rigid analytic geometry is no longer at our disposal. Our main purpose is to give a definable version of the canonical desingularization algorithm (the hypersurface case) due to Bierstone-Milman so that both of these powerful tools are available in the realm of non-Archimedean analytic geometry at the same time. It will be carried out within a category of definable, strong analytic manifolds and maps, which is more flexible than that of affinoid varieties and maps. Strong analytic objects are those definable ones that remain analytic over all fields elementarily equivalent to K. This condition may be regarded as a kind of symmetry imposed on ordinary analytic objects. The strong analytic category makes it possible to apply a model-theoretic compactness argument in the absence of the ordinary topological compactness. On the other hand, our closedness theorem enables application of resolution of singularities to topological problems involving the topology induced by valuation. Eventually, these three results will be applied to such issues as the existence of definable retractions or extending continuous definable functions. The established results remain valid for strictly convergent analytic structures, whose classical examples are complete, rank one valued fields with the Tate algebras of strictly convergent power series. The earlier techniques and approaches to the purely topological versions of those issues cannot be carried over to the definable settings because, among others, non-Archimedean geometry over non-locally compact fields suffers from lack of definable Skolem functions.",60021361,Uniwersytet Jagiello≈Ñski w Krakowie,Krakow,Poland,['1701'],22.5,0.08767006802721086,0.48880952380952375,1

These techniques are used for detecting the objects in the images. The real challenge in the acoustic image segmentation lies in differentiating the sea floor, sediments and the objects. Due to the typical characteristics and low resolution of the acoustic images, segmentation techniques such as region based, morphological based and edge based methods are not suitable. The sediments will also be traced along with the objects that makes the detection process a very difficult one. In this research paper, edge based segmentation method that uses the morphological operations for identifying the edges followed by a object tracing algorithm is proposed. The images used in this work are captured in real time using Edgetech 4125 Side scan sonar device. The acoustic images are first pre-processed using Wiener and Median filters and a morphological gradient is obtained by subtracting the morphologically dilated and eroded image. Next the edge map of the acoustic images are obtained using binarization method by which the object's boundary is made visible.

413,413,From distributed coordination to field calculus and aggregate computing,"Aggregate computing is an emerging approach to the engineering of complex coordination for distributed systems, based on viewing system interactions in terms of information propagating through collectives of devices, rather than in terms of individual devices and their interaction with their peers and environment. The foundation of this approach is the distillation of a number of prior approaches, both formal and pragmatic, proposed under the umbrella of field-based coordination, and culminating into the field calculus, a universal functional programming model for the specification and composition of collective behaviours with equivalent local and aggregate semantics. This foundation has been elaborated into a layered approach to engineering coordination of complex distributed systems, building up to pragmatic applications through intermediate layers encompassing reusable libraries of program components. Furthermore, some of these components are formally shown to satisfy formal properties like self-stabilisation, which transfer to whole application services by functional composition. In this survey, we trace the development and antecedents of field calculus, review the field calculus itself and the current state of aggregate computing theory and practice, and discuss a roadmap of current research directions with implications for the development of a broad range of distributed systems.",60028218,Alma Mater Studiorum Universit√† di Bologna,Bologna,Italy,"['1712', '1703']",38.8,-0.033749999999999995,0.27125,1

416,416,Improved Method for Enhancing Dark Images based on CLAHE and Morphological Reconstruction," All rights reserved.The image acquired are often flawed due to various defects from environmental scenarios such as indoor lighting, cloudy weather etc especially at night time. The dark image contains compressed dynamic range that can be enhanced for understanding the detailed information. In this investigative work, an improved method for enhancing extremely dark images is proposed utilizing the concept of illumination reflection model. This improved technique is based on Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and reconstruction done using morphological processing with Top-hat transformation. The image is perceived in HSV color system and V component is estimated. This intensity (V) component is normalized and the inverse of the intensity component is computed. Then CLAHE algorithm is applied on the negative image. Then multiscale image enhancement is applied to the resultant image. Gamma enhancement is used to adaptively adjust the brightness component of an image. After gamma enhancement, the results of two gamma enhanced images with different gamma values are obtained. Principal Component Analysis extracts the significant information from these images that can be used for image fusion. During the PCA based image fusion, the weight value is adaptively calculated by using morphological Top-hat transformation to improve the quality of the image and illuminate the inconsistent background pixels. The proposed method focuses detail enhancement of extremely dark images by preserving the edges and structures.

418,418,AI-Based Enhancement of Base Station Handover," All rights reserved.With exponential increase in digital data transfer and growing consumer base, there is a need to efficiently handle large set of users. In addition to that, we face a lot of problems due to poor signal connectivity during travel. Though operators look towards plantation of additional base stations or additional hardware, there is also a need to efficiently regulate the existing ones to utilize the resources in an effective manner thereby avoiding band exhaustion and also facilitating the handover of mobile stations in travel. When a mobile device is at travel, the device determines the next base station to which it has to be connected using the Received Signal Strength and requests the same. Therefore, prediction of the next potential base station in advance leads to a hexa-directional ambiguity (the mobile station may move to any of the adjacent 6 hexagonal cells in future which can't be predicted easily in advance). Ping-pong effects during the handovers are also a problem. Few other systems have been introduced which requires tracking of the device over a period of time to determine the trajectory thereby predicting the next potential base station in advance leading to privacy concerns. An addition to the system is proposed that could manipulate these handovers in an efficient manner while conserving privacy. We propose a triangular way of determining the next potential base station in advance. This method eliminates the hexa-directional ambiguity and determines the next one perfectly in advance thereby increasing the efficiency manifold. Reservation of band is done based on the prediction thereby reducing connectivity delays. Improving the existing ones manifold will reduce the requirement of additional hardware thereby facilitating sustainable development by reducing the dangerous impacts on Mother Nature.",60106323,"Sri Sai Ram Engineering College, Chennai",Chennai,India,['1700'],23.833333333333332,-0.1539377289377289,0.5639194139194139,0
419,419,An optimization framework for codes classification and performance evaluation of RISC microprocessors,"Pipelines, in Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) microprocessors, are expected to provide increased throughputs in most cases. However, there are a few instructions, and therefore entire assembly language codes, that execute faster and hazard-free without pipelines. It is usual for the compilers to generate codes from high level description that are more suitable for the underlying hardware to maintain symmetry with respect to performance; this, however, is not always guaranteed. Therefore, instead of trying to optimize the description to suit the processor design, we try to determine the more suitable processor variant for the given code during compile time, and dynamically reconfigure the system accordingly. In doing so, however, we first need to classify each code according to its suitability to a different processor variant. The latter, in turn, gives us confidence in performance symmetry against various types of codes-this is the primary contribution of the proposed work. We first develop mathematical performance models of three conventional microprocessor designs, and propose a symmetry-improving nonlinear optimization method to achieve code-to-design mapping. Our analysis is based on four different architectures and 324,000 different assembly language codes, each with between 10 and 1000 instructions with different percentages of commonly seen instruction types. Our results suggest that in the sub-micron era, where execution time of each instruction is merely in a few nanoseconds, codes accumulating as low as 5% (or above) hazard causing instructions execute more swiftly on processors without pipelines.",60104671,University of Hail,Hail,Saudi Arabia,['1701'],26.333333333333332,0.11412087912087912,0.4168772893772893,1

In traditional methods of training a model, data is gathered at a centralized machine where training on the entire data takes place. This has led to a major problem of not only scalability but also of preserving the anonymity and privacy of sensitive user data. As a consequence, there has been extensive work done towards distributed machine learning. In more recent times, Federated Learning has gained a lot of traction. This is because of the features that make it highly suitable to train models collaboratively while preserving the privacy of sensitive data.

There were far-reaching privacy apprehensions as individual medical records may possibly be unveiled to some third-party servers in addition to unconstitutional parties. On the road to warrant the patients' charge to access their medical records, it is a hopeful procedure to encrypt the medical records prior to outsourcing. Hitherto, questions like exposure to privacy, scalability during key management, in addition to proficient user revocation, have lingered the most imperative tests in the direction of accomplishing fine-grained access control. This manuscript puts forward a fresh multi-layer patient-centric scaffold in addition to an anthology of techniques in support of data access control to medical records amassed in honest-but-curious servers. In the direction of accomplishing fine-grained as well as scalable access control, a new-fangled modification of Cipher-text Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) technique is persuaded with random key length in the offline encryption phase to encrypt each patient's PHR file. In the online phase, the CP-ABE encrypted data is transmitted to the cloud through a secure tunnel and then the data in rest is encrypted again by the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256). In order to eliminate the problem aroused from leaked keys, both attribute and user revocation is done. The proposed system achieves data confidentiality, access control, user revocation, random key length, resists collusion attack, tracks the user location periodically, and preserves forward and backward secrecy. Within the MLPPT-MHS scheme, the computation time to perform Key Generation, Encryption, and Decryption would be 823.75ms, 152.43ms, 82.54ms and the storage overhead incurred to record the Public Parameters, Secret Key and Cipher Text would be 6098 bits, 59,653 bits, and 26,712 bits.

425,425,Predicting value of binding constants of organic ligands to beta-cyclodextrin: Application of marsplines and descriptors encoded in SMILES string,"The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSPR) model was formulated to quantify values of the binding constant (lnK) of a series of ligands to beta-cyclodextrin (Œ≤-CD). For this purpose, the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARSplines) methodology was adopted with molecular descriptors derived from the simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) strings. This approach allows discovery of regression equations consisting of new non-linear components (basis functions) being combinations of molecular descriptors. The model was subjected to the standard internal and external validation procedures, which indicated its high predictive power. The appearance of polarity-related descriptors, such as XlogP, confirms the hydrophobic nature of the cyclodextrin cavity. The model can be used for predicting the affinity of new ligands to Œ≤-CD. However, a non-standard application was also proposed for classification into Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) drug types. It was found that a single parameter, which is the estimated value of lnK, is sufficient to distinguish highly permeable drugs (BCS class I and II) from low permeable ones (BCS class II and IV). In general, it was found that drugs of the former group exhibit higher affinity to Œ≤-CD then the latter group (class III and IV).",60024615,Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz,Bydgoszcz,Poland,['1701'],21.333333333333332,0.05475324675324676,0.29578066378066376,1

But of late, a lot of problems are being faced in agriculture by the farmers. One of the major problems being water scarcity. As per surveys, almost 20 percent of the agricultural land is wasted due to water scarcity and becomes a barren land. Thus, this research gives an idea of smart irrigation system. This irrigation system uses three sensors namely temperature sensor, humidity sensor and soil moisture sensor, and fuzzy logic is used to operate the solenoid valve. The data from the sensors is then sent to the cloud by using adafruit.io and the farmer can view the moisture level, humidity level and temperature recorded by these sensors. All the operations are governed by an Arduino and the power supply for the Arduino is given by a solar panel which uses LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and makes it into an automatic tracking system.

In the proposed method, the input image is first decomposed into eight binary bit planes. Then in each of the first four most significant bit planes, for each center pixel, the dissimilarity information of its binary neighbors are encoded into a single value. The encoded values of each bit plane is then compared with the intensity of the center pixel and this relationship is finally encoded to devise the LBPANDP descriptor. The proposed descriptor is highly discriminative and considers only the first four most significant bit planes for encoding, which greatly reduces the dimension of the feature vector.

442,442,Correlation dynamics of dipolar bosons in 1D triple well optical lattice,"The concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking and off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) are associated with Bose-Einstein condensation. However, as in the system of reduced dimension the effect of quantum fluctuation is dominating, the concept of ODLRO becomes more interesting, especially for the long-range interaction. In the present manuscript, we study the correlation dynamics triggered by lattice depth quench in a system of three dipolar bosons in a 1D triple-well optical lattice from the first principle using the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). Our main motivation is to explore how ODLRO develops and decays with time when the system is brought out-of-equilibrium by a sudden change in the lattice depth. We compare results of dipolar bosons with contact interaction. For forward quench (Vf > Vi), the system exhibits the collapse-revival dynamics in the time evolution of normalized first-and second-order Glauber's correlation function, time evolution of Shannon information entropy both for the contact as well as for the dipolar interaction which is reminiscent of the one observed in Greiner's experiment [Nature, 415 (2002)]. We define the collapse and revival time ratio as the figure of merit (t) which can uniquely distinguish the timescale of dynamics for dipolar interaction from that of contact interaction. In the reverse quench process (Vi > Vf), for dipolar interaction, the dynamics is complex and the system does not exhibit any definite time scale of evolution, whereas the system with contact interaction exhibits collapse-revival dynamics with a definite time-scale. The long-range repulsive tail in the dipolar interaction inhibits the spreading of correlation across the lattice sites.",60031745,Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics,Trieste,Italy,['1701'],28.77777777777778,0.1608974358974359,0.5358974358974359,1
443,443,Implementing smart swapping algorithm to boost the performance of Linux PC's.," All rights reserved.Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM. Swap space is located on hard drives, which have a slower access time than physical memory. If any memory-intensive application is deployed on a PC with limited amount of Random-Access Memory, the inactive (not recently used) application which is generally the system UI is shifted to the Swap memory (much slower than RAM). This makes the entire UI slow but the higher priority processes (the most recent applications) remain unaffected because they remain in the RAM. When we are finished with our work with the memory intensive application and close it, the RAM gets cleared and has ample of space to accommodate the contents of the SWAP memory. But the swap memory stays as it is, and does not get transferred back to the RAM. This results in slower UI even though the system has enough RAM and no memory intensive process is running. This then results in lag in UI transition, delayed application launches, slower processing of programs and a large overhead.In years past, the recommended amount of swap space increased linearly with the amount of RAM in the system. But because the amount of memory in modern systems has increased into the hundreds of gigabytes, it is now recognized that the amount of swap space that a system needs is a function of the memory workload running on that system.In the world of enhanced hardware and superior machines, the software enhancements and optimization for low end PC's is sometimes neglected. Hence, we propose a technique to overcome the lag created by the swap space y moving the content of the swap memory back to the RAM and a total boost is provided to the system. The technique is evaluated under various configurations and proves to solve the problem.",60106090,"Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai",Chennai,India,['1700'],27.076923076923077,0.10004105090311985,0.3697865353037767,0

447,447,Ensuring liveness properties of distributed systems: Open problems,"Often fairness assumptions need to be made in order to establish liveness properties of distributed systems, but in many situations they lead to false conclusions. This document presents a research agenda aiming at laying the foundations of a theory of concurrency that is equipped to ensure liveness properties of distributed systems without making fairness assumptions. This theory will encompass process algebra, temporal logic and semantic models. The agenda also includes the development of a methodology and tools that allow successful application of this theory to the specification, analysis and verification of realistic distributed systems. Contemporary process algebras and temporal logics fail to make distinctions between systems of which one has a crucial liveness property and the other does not, at least when assuming justness, a strong progress property, but not assuming fairness. Setting up an alternative framework involves giving up on identifying strongly bisimilar systems, inventing new induction principles, developing new axiomatic bases for process algebras and new congruence formats for operational semantics, and creating matching treatments of time and probability. Even simple systems like fair schedulers or mutual exclusion protocols cannot be accurately specified in standard process algebras (or Petri nets) in the absence of fairness assumptions.

This leads to an exhaustion of resources of the targeted system. Such a system or infrastructure under attack won't be able to cope up with the services it needs to provide due to capacity overload. These types of attacks are also called as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. As it is essential for companies and organizations to provide high speed and high-quality services the network in which it operates needs to be secured against DoS attacks. As it is said prevention is better than cure, it is always better to detect an attack in the preliminary stages itself and deny an attacker any opportunity to continue the assault on the system. There are various kinds of DoS attacks, in this study the focus is on three kinds of attacks and its detection ICMP flood attack, UDP flood attack and TCP SYN flood attack. The detection mechanism employed is based on packet symmetry which can be used in to monitor the data flow in a network and detect any malicious anomalies in the network traffic at any instant.

The intensity variations in a US B-mode image are due to variation in the texture of the underlying tissues, but in a US elastography image relates to strain value in tissues and have more potential in tissue differentiation. This study aims to develop a new scheme to automatically determine a seed point in an US elastography image based on mean strain value, thereby speeding up the segmentation process and to use elasticity features extracted from the segmented images to improve the classification rate. A new method of mean strain value calculation within the abnormal region is introduced to develop a new automatic method of selecting a seed point that helps in the precise segmentation of the lesion area. A neural network is used to classify the abnormal masses from texture, shape and two new elasticity features extracted from the segmented regions. The new approach of automatic seed point selection used on a dataset of 62 US elastography images achieved an accuracy of 90.32%. The average Tanimotto coefficient of US elastography images segmented using this approach is 0.75123. The classifier provided a sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy of 80.00%, 86.67%, and 84.00% respectively.

For increasing the clarity of the image generally, histogram or Retinex theory based algorithms were used. These procedures worked on enhancing the reflectance layer by ignoring illumination, which is not a better strategy and leads to poor results. Fuzzy based image enhancement approach makes use of illumination by omitting reflectance. In our proposed algorithm, Homomorphic decomposition is used for getting the exact illumination image from the value layer of HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) image. Next, the parametric fuzzy transform is employed to enhance the image by updating its membership functions and thereby smoothing the luminance layer.

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been established to protect Cross Interior (routing) at source to goal from different types of attack. Current IDS approaches can be classified as either anomaly or signature-based methods such as Rule-based expert systems, State transition analysis, Bayesian alarm networks aspects are various challenges with respect to the efficiency as well as performance. The major challenge is the compromise of performance because of unavailable resources with respect to the MANET. To increase the MANET environment's performance, various techniques are employed for routing, security purpose. An efficient security module requires a routing in terms of packet loss. The Integrated Cross Interior (ICI) structure for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) namely ICIs for IDS are proposed for exactness of black hole attacks detection. The ICIs for IDS performs the task of routing of the mobile nodes. The proposed (ICIs for IDS) produces the enhancement of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with routing algorithm named as Integrated Cross Interior algorithm that performs maps the security with the secure IDS communication and distributes the packets among different destination, based on priority. This paper proposes a novel Integrated Cross Interior structure for Intrusion Detection System (ICIS for IDS) to secure our network from black hole attacks. This algorithm is proposed for node routing and node security by considering maximum throughput 83.5% with minimum routing cost, response time with 6.3ms.

Using band segmented transmission orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (BST-OFDM), the delivery of innovative video-on-demand and HDTV services is supported. To take full advantage of the attractive benefits of BST-OFDM, it is important to estimate integer frequency offset (IFO) without a priori knowledge on the segment type that is transmitted over transmission and the multiplexing configuration control (TMCC) signal. To address this issue, an efficient IFO detection method is proposed for the ISDB-T system employing BST-OFDM. To enable IFO detection independent of the segment type, information-bearing TMCC signals that are asymmetrically distributed in the frequency domain are used as pilot symbols. Numerical analysis is performed to present the relationship between error probability and design parameter. We show via the numerical results that the multiple transmitted TMCC information is efficiently used for blind estimation of the IFO, achieving robust estimation in the presence of the fractional frequency offset.",60027884,Sejong University,Seoul,South Korea,['1701'],25.714285714285715,0.14999999999999997,0.38782051282051283,1

476,476,On the assumption of the independence of thermodynamic properties on the gravitational field,"A reversible cyclic process is analyzed in which the center of mass of an ideal gas is raised in a gravitational field during both an expansion phase and a subsequent contraction phase, with the gas returning to its initial height in a final step. When the properties of the gas are taken as uniform, the thermodynamic efficiency of this cycle is able to exceed that of a corresponding Carnot cycle, which is a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. The source of this discrepancy was previously claimed, when analyzing a similar heating and cooling of a sphere, to be the assumed independence of the internal energy on the gravitational field. However, this violation is only apparent since all of the effects of the gravitational field were not incorporated fully into the thermodynamic analysis of the cycle. When all the influences of the gravitational field are considered, no possible violation of the second law can occur. The evaluation of the entropy changes of the gas throughout the cycle also highlights other key inconsistencies that arise when the full effects of the gravitational field are neglected. As the analysis of the cycle provided here shows, the assumption of the independence of the internal energy, as well as other thermodynamic properties, on the gravitational field strength can still be invoked.",60009254,Purdue University,West Lafayette,United States,['1701'],31.142857142857142,0.059166666666666666,0.3995833333333333,1

Cloud computing provides reliable Quality of Service defined in terms of Service Level Agreements (SLA). To schedule scientific workflows in cloud environment, where resources are shared, it is important to manage the cloud resources efficiently by maximizing utilization. The dynamic nature of cloud resources, due to sharing, heterogeneity, virtualization and workload variations offer a host of challenges in terms of resource availability and performance. This may have a significant impact on task execution times and data transfer times, thus introducing delay in overall execution time called makespan, In this paper, Multi Criteria based Resource Score Heuristic for Cloud Workflow Scheduling is proposed, with an objective of minimizing makespan considering the probability of temporal availability of resources in a cloud computing environment. To choose the best virtual machine with optimal value of maximum resource availability and minimum task execution time, a method of compensatory aggregation of conflicting criteria, is used for scoring each resource.

MADM focuses on the decision problem of discrete and finite decision schemes. Uncertain MADM is an extension and development of classical multi-attribute decision making theory. When the attribute value of MADM is shown by neutrosophic number, that is, the attribute value is complex data and needs three values to express, it is called the MADM problem in which the attribute values are neutrosophic numbers. However, in practical MADM problems, to minimize errors in individual decision making, we need to consider the ideas of many people and synthesize their opinions. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the method of attribute information aggregation. In this paper, we proposed a new theory-non-dual multi-granulation neutrosophic rough set (MS)-to aggregate multiple attribute information and solve a multi-attribute group decision-making (MGDM) problem where the attribute values are neutrosophic numbers.

The following paper addresses the challenges associated with this. A large amount of weather and climate information is presently available for farmers. A portion of the information is operational or already under development, and in particular, forecasting through climatic data and formation may not be suitable for farmers when it comes to the decision-making process. The best way to gain an advantage from natural factors is to consider them during decision-making and understand them in the best way possible. Meteorological information pertaining to agriculture, and climatic data, in particular, is an important aspect of planning in the context of agricultural production. Therefore, climatic conditions must be an integral part of the decision-making process. These factors can be determined by recording hourly, daily, and weekly temperature data, rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed, evaporation, relative humidity, and evapotranspiration. Artificial Neural Networks possess the capability of not just analysing the data but also learning from the data.

483,483,Error Detection of Data Conversion in Flash ADC using Code Width Based Technique," All rights reserved.The high integration density of the complex electronic system requires the multi-functional testing facility to ensure the accuracy of the circuit function. In addition, the wide population of submicron technologies results in the persistent requirements of high precision analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. In the complex, high-density circuits, observing the correctness of output are limited due to the limitations of input and output pins which develop the AMS circuit test as very difficult and expensive. A digital built-in self-test (BIST) scheme has been presented in this paper for testing an analog to digital converter (ADC) in the time domain. The testing scheme consists of the linear analog ramp generator, ADC as a circuit under test, output response analyzer and a BIST controller. Bootstrap linear ramp generator is used to generate the linear analog ramp signal which is applied to ADC to develop the digital word sequence for testing. Among various types of ADCs, here a Flash ADC has used since it is fastest and accurate in digital conversion. A Flash ADC has been designed with the seven-bit resolution and tested using the proposed digital BIST scheme. The ADC comprises a sample-hold circuit, 2N -1 comparator, XOR gates, and encoder block. The output response analyzer verifies the digital output sequence to validate the static test parameters of ADC called monotonicity, missing codes, DNL, and INL error. The BIST controller generates the control signals to control the test sequence. The complete test sequence of ADC BIST has simulated in Tanner EDA with TSMC 0.18um technology. ORA is used to analyze the presence of monotonicity, missing codes, DNL and INL error in the ADC output.",60005941,Madras Institute of Technology,Chennai,India,['1700'],21.153846153846153,-0.05363945578231292,0.3348185941043084,0

While originally devised to facilitate reasoning about an individual's or a population's living conditions, it was later adapted to many other applications. A wayfinder is an entity that moves through a space-time continuum with possible obstacles. We show how to model the pertinent notions in relational algebra (and, more abstractly, in modal semirings) with box and diamond operators. Admissible or undesired regions can be described as Boolean combinations of primitive regions such as the set of all points reachable by forward or backward movement from a given region or starting point. To derive results about the region blocked by the union of two regions we introduce an abstract algebraic view of coordinates that is largely independent of dimensional and metric aspects and thus very general.

The main aim of the problem is to assign colors to the elements of a graph such as vertices and/or edges subject to certain constraints. The 1-harmonious coloring is a kind of vertex coloring such that the color pairs of end vertices of every edge are different only for adjacent edges and the optimal constraint that the least number of colors is to be used. In this paper, we investigate the graphs in which we attain the sharp bound on 1-harmonious coloring.

490,490,Effective Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease using Modified Decision Tree Classifier," All rights reserved.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is described as a severe form of the neural disorder that collectively degenerate the essential cognitive activities of a human being (thinking, memory retention, etc.,) in particular among the elderly individuals and eventually results in death. In addition to the adverse ill-health effects on the patients, AD imposes paramount responsibility and burden on the caretakers too. Several genetic and pathological traits and non-invasive diagnostic strategies are being vigorously investigated and explored to discover the early onset of this debilitating disease. The prognosis of AD assumes importance, as the deterioration of health due to its progression may be either contained or controlled. Moreover, early and accurate detection of AD helps medical practitioners to prescribe case-specific medical treatment procedure. Among the popular machine learning algorithms, decision tree technique is widely used for classification/prediction, due to its accuracy and speed.This research article presents a novel decision tree-based classification technique, with optimum hyper parametertuning, that is ideally suitable for AD diagnosis, even at the early stages of development. The performance of this newly proposed Decision Tree Classifier with Hyper Parameters Tuning (DTC-HPT) is validated on the Open Access Imaging Studies Series (OASIS) dataset that contains patients' data on the different stages of AD. The DTC-HPT is designed with the primary objective to classify the nature of brain abnormality using the most relevantand potentially significant data attributes/parameters. The efficiency of DTC-HPT on AD classification is measured as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

503,503,An enhanced optimization scheme based on gradient descent methods for machine learning,"A The learning process of machine learning consists of finding values of unknown weights in a cost function by minimizing the cost function based on learning data. However, since the cost function is not convex, it is conundrum to find the minimum value of the cost function. The existing methods used to find the minimum values usually use the first derivative of the cost function. When even the local minimum (but not a global minimum) is reached, since the first derivative of the cost function becomes zero, the methods give the local minimum values, so that the desired global minimum cannot be found. To overcome this problem, in this paper we modified one of the existing schemes-the adaptive momentum estimation scheme-by adding a new term, so that it can prevent the new optimizer from staying at local minimum. The convergence condition for the proposed scheme and the convergence value are also analyzed, and further explained through several numerical experiments whose cost function is non-convex.",60029274,Daegu University,Gyeongsan,South Korea,['1701'],27.333333333333332,0.02305194805194805,0.25183982683982686,1

With these existing prediction models, it is possible only to reduce and delay the symptoms of the disease. The exact usefulness is when the presence of the disease is identified at an early stage and this early detection makes a great impact in subjects' recovery. Thus, early detection of controls at high risk of development of Alzheimer's disease is of a key objective of the proposed work.

512,512,The fairer sex: Male/female differences in architects' use of colour when designing,"This paper considers if the gender of architects, as one aspect of their cultural indoctrination, impacts their colour use. In other words, it considers if colour use in architectural design is gendered via a process of cultural indoctrination that is influenced by the attitudes towards gender, principally in relation to the biological sex binary, that are prevalent in the cultural contexts that shape us. A survey of 274 designers asked: Does gender affect an architect's general attitude towards three dependant variables: 1) colour use; 2) colour preferences; 3) use of colour when designing? It was found that while female architects perceived colour to be more important to architecture than males did, females' portfolios are significantly less colourful. Gender differences were also found for hue preference, dominant colour use and the use of colours for building exteriors. The findings provide the design community with more information about the relationship between culture and colour responses and highlight how gender values may, via colour use, impact architectural design. The authors argue for an approach to design education that acknowledges the potency of architects' subjective tendencies in relation to objective design influences such as the brief or the physical context of a building.",60018805,Deakin University,Geelong,Australia,['1704'],33.166666666666664,0.10416666666666667,0.3203231292517007,1

However, downstream dimensions are difficult to trade against more traditional engineering objectives. This research studied through individual interviews how six disciplines use models to negotiate design trade-offs. References to models were categorised according to whether models supported or hampered the duration of trade-off identification and how they impacted the duration of trade-off resolution. The results point to the difficulty of applying downstream lifecycle issues earlier in the design process because of the characteristics of the models that are used. A list of characteristics promoting and limiting the use of four models as boundary objects (CAD models, simulation results, total cost of ownership and decision matrices) is provided.

Complete activities of living organisms are grounded on the DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) /RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) sequences of their body. This was the salient motivation behind exploring the research on computational analysis of cancer sequences. In this paper, breast cancer sequences of Homo sapiens and mice are considered for analysis. A DNA sequence is framed with four key chemicals, A (Adenine), G (Guanine), C (Cytosine) and T (Thymine) which are referred as Nucleobases. The sequences taken for analysis vary in their size. Genome reduction for making equal sizes for all sequences may lead to non-optimal analysis and hence the original length is considered for the entire analysis. Genomic analysis such as individual Nucleobase average count, AT and GC-content, AT/GC composition, G-Quadruplex occurrence and occurrence status of Open Reading Frame (ORF) in each sequence are calculated. Execution time was calculated for sequence fetching process and ORF analysis. The human and mouse sequences were fetched approximately at 79 milli seconds(ms) and 177ms respectively.

This behavior deceives viewers and wastes network resources. Therefore, a stable algorithm that detects fake bitrate videos is urgently needed. High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is a worldwide popular video coding standard. Hence, in this paper, a robust algorithm is proposed to detect HEVC fake bitrate videos. Firstly, five effective feature sets are extracted from the prediction process of HEVC, including Coding Unit of I-picture/P-picture partitioning modes, Prediction Unit of I-picture/P-picture partitioning modes, Intra Prediction Modes of I-picture. Secondly, feature concatenation is adopted to enhance the expressiveness and improve the effectiveness of the features. Finally, five single feature sets and three concatenate feature sets are separately sent to the support vector machine for modeling and testing. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on HEVC videos of various resolutions and fake bitrates.

This causes the country to lose huge number of soldiers due to lack of technology rather than enemy attack. Location tracing of a soldier during such panic situation is required to get information of soldier's current situation. High end technological devices have been produced to help them manage various situations during their mission. In the current study one lightweight wearable device is developed that embed existing small devices onto a Chip (SoC) which piecewise integrate these devices to develop a user-friendly watch or batch or helmet. The proposed system enables a communication with the army base station to track the location and health status of soldiers. This is done through embedding GPS (Global positioning system) module with low power wireless body sensors in the system. Communication is set up two way: using antenna and using a GSM module. This improves reliability of the communication and makes it more fault tolerant. Hence the risk of non-functioning of the system in case of a failure in one part is reduced.

Graphology is the scientific term used for handwriting analysis. Professional handwriting examiners, called graphologists, manually study and understand the handwriting of an individual to classify the writers personality. Nevertheless, the manual process of handwriting analysis is time-consuming, costly and depends majorly on the skills of the graphologists. To make this process computerized we extracted several features of handwriting samples and classified the writer into 5 personality traits namely Energetic, Extrovert, Introvert, Sloppy and Optimistic. Histogram of oriented gradient(HOG) extracts the features from the handwriting sample of the writer which serves as an input for the Support Vector Machine model to give output as the personality trait of the person. For this paper, digital handwriting sample data of 50 different users were collected. The proposed system predicts the personality trait of a person with 80% correctness using the Polynomial kernel.

534,534,A first-time investigation of psychosocial inclusivity in design: Inclusive supermarket design for older individuals," ¬© The Author(s) 2019.As a first-time investigation of 'psychosocial inclusivity' in design, this paper introduces and establishes the concept of psychosocially inclusive design, and explores it within the context of supermarket shopping for older individuals, as one instrumental activity of daily living. Inclusive design theory and practice have been predominantly concerned with issues of physical access, limiting its scope and relevance to the wider more complex psychosocial issues. Employing research triangulation and rigorous empirical investigations, this paper advances the fundamental understanding, extends the general research agenda, and pushes the current boundaries of inclusive design towards non-physical inclusion by identifying any possible psychosocial constructs. Four constructs including 'cognitive', 'emotional', 'social', and 'value' were identified in the context of supermarket shopping through ethnographic interviews; creative workshop; and observations conducted with a total of 58 older individuals.

535,535,"Structural monitoring and performance assessment of shield tunnels during the operation period, based on distributed optical-fiber sensors","The weak parts of shield tunnels are not obvious, so it is urgently necessary to implement distributed monitoring based on an advanced sensing method. As the horizontal loads at both sides of the shield tunnel present a type of symmetric distribution, the deformation parameters under the vertical loads are often selected as the key monitored parameters, such as convergence, settlement, and seam opening. In this paper, the monitoring of the proposed deformation parameters is innovatively implemented with only one sensing technology, namely distributed optical-fiber strain sensing technology. First, the improved distributed optical-fiber sensors are introduced with the sensing performance. Second, a structural health monitoring (SHM) system for operational shield tunnels is proposed, including optical-fiber sensor installation, data logging and saving, key parameter analysis, and structural health assessment. The key monitoring theory and technology are also proposed. The proposed system has been verified by experiments at the Nanjing Yangtze River tunnel. In the experiments, the proposed optical-fiber sensors were installed on the surface of a selected tunnel ring, with a longitudinal span of approximately 90 m long. The experiments were conducted over 55 days to measure the distributed strain and temperature. Then the key parameters were obtained from the measurements, with which the structural health was assessed. The possibility that the shield tunnel SHM system can be constructed with the improved distributed optical-fiber sensors, monitoring theory, and technology is proven.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,['1701'],20.818181818181817,0.04833333333333333,0.663888888888889,1
536,536,Acquisition and utilization of mental imagery capability in robotic action sequencing tasks," All rights reserved.This work presents a series of neurorobotic models underlying learning in robots. It demonstrates the way in which, during sensorimotor exploration, robots do not just gain knowledge about how to form movement primitives but also obtain a mental imagery capability. Mental imagery plays a key role in these computational models by accelerating learning processes of action sequencing tasks. The first experiment involves permitting a humanoid robot to learn how to retrieve an out-of-reach object using a provided tool. This experiment explores a phenomenon on tool use development found in human infants. In addition, it tests two hypotheses on tool use development. The second experiment extends the domain of robot learning by targeting a useful robotic application. It drives a service robot to learn to acquire knowledge of how to manipulate perceived objects based on the objects‚Äô information and a goal from users. By means of planning, learning the sequence of actions in mind, the robots are able to learn by examining actions‚Äô outcome without really performing actions. This allows the second model to completely exclude parts of overt movements from the training loop.

537,537,Real Time Feature Point Detectors for Determining Ego Motions," All rights reserved.Ego motion determination is an important application to recognize the motion of an observer in real time. Here we have implemented feature point detector using FFME for ego-motion determination. The main objective of this work is to detect the motions of any objects such as humans, animals, vehicles, missiles and so on. The camera plays a vital role in surveillance of isolated and or restricted area. To improve the intelligence of camera some efficient video processing algorithms are needed. In this process, the detection of unwanted features were derived and developed for some video processing applications. There are various types of feature detectors like edge, corner and points which can be detected from a video frame. To detect those features, feature point detectors like SIFT, ORB, FAST, BRIEF and FFME are more reliable with good efficiency, less memory size and high processing speed. These feature point detectors are compared and evaluated under parameters of speed and number of feature point matches. Although, FFME algorithm has high speed when compared to other feature point detection algorithms, it is prone to more errors caused by illumination differences, as it detects the feature points using Gradient magnitude of the pixel. To overcome this, we have introduced a novel work that uses FFME with gradient phase technique. The resultant output exhibits high processing speed with less error when compared to other feature point detectors and even FFME with gradient magnitude.",60008648,University of Madras,Chennai,India,['1700'],19.916666666666668,0.13816666666666672,0.42349999999999993,0
538,538,Community-aware Photo Quality Evaluation by Deeply Encoding Human Perception,"IEEEComputational photo quality evaluation is a useful technique in many tasks of computer vision and graphics, <formula><tex>$e.g.$</tex></formula>, photo retaregeting, 3D rendering, and fashion recommendation. Conventional photo quality models are designed by characterizing pictures from all communities (<formula><tex>$e.g.$</tex></formula>, &#x201C;architecture&#x201D; and &#x201C;colorful&#x201D;) indiscriminately, wherein community-specific features are not encoded explicitly. In this work, we develop a new community-aware photo quality evaluation framework. It uncovers the latent community-specific topics by a regularized latent topic model (LTM), and captures human visual quality perception by exploring multiple attributes. More specifically, given massive-scale online photos from multiple communities, a novel ranking algorithm is proposed to measure the visual/semantic attractiveness of regions inside each photo. Meanwhile, three attributes: photo quality scores, weak semantic tags, and inter-region correlations, are seamlessly and collaboratively incorporated during ranking. Subsequently, we construct gaze shifting path (GSP) for each photo by sequentially linking the top-ranking regions from each photo, and an aggregation-based deep CNN calculates the deep representation for each GSP. Based on this, an LTM is proposed to model the GSP distribution from multiple communities in the latent space. To mitigate the overfitting problem caused by communities with very few photos, a regularizer is added into our LTM. Finally, given a test photo, we obtain its deep GSP representation and its quality score is determined by the posterior probability of the regularized LTM. Comprehensive comparative studies on four image sets have shown the competitiveness of our method. Besides, eye tracking experiments demonstrated that our ranking-based GSPs are highly consistent with real human gaze movements.",60013614,Hangzhou Dianzi University,Hangzhou,China,"['1711', '1706']",21.0,0.05992888064316637,0.30555658627087207,1

However, the current approach to the requirements engineering process is still lacking in auto-generating model and documentation. Most approaches only focusing in building UML use cases and a brief version of Software Requirements Specification (SRS), which are not enough as a basis for the code development process. A Rule-based Ontology Framework (ROF) for AutoGenerating Requirements Specification is proposed. It is used for auto-generating requirements specifications that consist of semi-formal modeling in Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) and natural language of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) in IEEE template. This paper discusses the implementation of ROF in a requirement engineering process in a University located in Indonesia. It is applied in Lecturer Workload Management (LWM) Application, an application that summarizes lecturer workload and calculates the scores as basis for generating salary. This application was developed by the Department of Information Systems (ISD). Existing requirements engineering process mostly depend on users' perspective which causes building the requirements documentation require much effort and do not represent the real needs of users. Thus, the requirements documents do not support the development process which causes project delay. Using ROF, the requirements engineering process becomes more effective by specifying functional requirements that represent user's needs and produce document that is feasible to be used as a reference for the development process.",60012005,Multimedia University,Malacca Town,Malaysia,['1702'],21.272727272727273,0.2571428571428572,0.49166666666666664,0

It consists in grouping together similar objects and is often considered to be an information compression task. In real life applications, clustering is often applied to online data to process live stream that may come from several sources.

Our algorithm has the advantage of handling incremental learning while combining the strengths of both information theory methods that have proved to be efficient and ideal candidates for clustering tasks, and collaborative clustering algorithms that have the capacity to process data from several sources such as neural network. Our proposed model relies on a Kolmogorov complexity based formulation of collaborative clustering, and data-wise division and optimization of this objective function, thus enabling to individually process multi-view data as they arrive.

For its complex application environment, the temperature and humidity in the drying material cannot be precisely controlled during microwave drying process. However, microwave drying without exactly controlling temperature and humidity is unable to guarantee the quality of agricultural products. To achieve a high quality, this paper proposed a fuzzy control method for the microwave dryer, which could control the temperature and humidity precisely. To identify the dry effect of the proposed fuzzy control scheme, drying time of Chinese jujube during fuzzy microwave (FM) drying, ordinary microwave (OM) drying, and temperature microwave (TM) drying were investigated, quality attributes such as vitamin C (VC), color and total flavonoids content (TFC) of dried samples were evaluated. As the results showed, total drying time used to reduce 500 g jujube moisture content from 74% to 6% on dry basis required 30, 26, and 31 min using FM drying, OM drying and TM drying, respectively. The drying rate with FM drying was the fastest. Jujube dried by FM drying revealed better color and higher retentions of VC and TFC content than TM and OM drying. Compared with TM and OM drying, FM drying performed shorter drying time and better quality of samples, indicating that microwave dryer with fuzzy controller can provide a practical and effective method for drying jujube with acceptable product quality.",60000174,Shaanxi Normal University,Xi'an,China,['1702'],26.22222222222222,0.07383333333333333,0.5295,0

The flexibility and rental approach of the cloud makes it an attractive option for the deployment of web services based applications. Once a number of web services are available to gratify the similar functionalities, then the choice of the web service based on personalized quality of service (QoS) parameters plays an important role in deciding the selection of the web service. The role of time is rarely being discussed in deciding the QoS of web services. The delivery of QoS is not made as declared due to the correlated behavior of non-functional performance of web services with the invocation time. This happens because service status usually changes over time. These limitations have affected the performance of neighborhood based collaborative filtering. Hence, the design of the time aware web service recommendation system based on the personalized QoS parameters is very crucial and turn out to be a challenging research issue. In the current work, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) enabled deep learning model long short term memory (LSTM) is used for the prediction of these time aware QoS parameters and the results are compared with the previous approaches.

561,561,A novel Chinese character recognition method based on multi-modal fusion," All rights reserved.In recent years, deep learning models are significantly improving capacity of computer vision. Especially in the field of Chinese character recognition, due to the complex structure of the characters, traditional rule-based or machine learning methods have been no longer competitive in terms of the measures such as recognition precision. Inspired by the actual reading process of human beings, we find that the processing of character recognition involves multiple modal information, while single-modal information of images is not only needed. Thus, we study the multi-modal fusion, and propose a novel multi-network model for Chinese character recognition in this paper. The proposed model consists of CNNs, LSTMs and full connection networks, fusing multi-modal information for classifying input images. After experiments, we found that multi-modal fusion can improve the accuracy of character recognition.",60025785,Shanghai Maritime University,Shanghai,China,['1702'],22.166666666666668,0.02,0.41999999999999993,0

For BANN, model parameters for both pulse rate (R) and loudness (A) are fixed as 0.5. Whilst, R and A parameters for BatNN will dynamically self-adapt in searching the optimal configuration during the training process. Hidden node (HN), iteration number (IN) and learning rate (LR) for both models are predetermined to be 100, 1000 and 1 respectively for comparison. Investigations were carried out with different population (b), maximum pulse frequency (fmax) and velocity factor (Œ±). Models performance will be measured with Square Root of Correlation of Determination (r), Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient (E). Data from 1961 to 1990 are used for training, whilst validation data are from 1991 to 2010. Predictors of three climate models including HadCM3, ECHAM5 and HadGEM3-RA cum collected precipitation data from Kuching Airport Rainfall Station are input into the models. Model output is the forecasted precipitation. Results showed BatNN is more robust than BANN with its average r=0.96, average RMSE=1.69, average MAE=1.4 and average E=0.84 across the three climate models; while BANN achieved average r=0.95, average RMSE=1.91, average MAE=1.75 and average E=0.82 across the three climate models. The higher accuracy of BatNN can be attributed to the modifications done where dynamical parameters R and A are used in place of static parameter to allow BatNN to self-adapt during the training process.",60021005,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,Johor Bahru,Malaysia,['1702'],23.181818181818183,-0.02587719298245614,0.474122807017544,0
567,567,Image enhancement of palm veins based on adaptive fusion and Gabor filter," All rights reserved.A palm vein enhancement method based on adaptive fusion and Gabor filter is proposed to overcome the degradation of recognition performance due to low image contrast, unclear details, and effects of noise, palm print, and false veins. First, the image is enhanced on the basis of the difference of Gaussian (DOG) algorithm and the partial overlapped sub-block histogram equalization (POSHE) algorithm, respectively. Second, the two kinds of enhanced images are fused adaptively according to the second-order statistic of each gray-level co-occurrence matrix. Lastly, a multidirectional Gabor filter is used to obtain the final enhanced image. This method not only retains the advantages of the DOG algorithm in separating the background from the veins, indicating an enhanced vein edge details, but also preserves the benefits of the POSHE algorithm in enhancing image contrast and local details. Simultaneously, the multidirectional Gabor filter is used to enhance the direction information, eliminate the interferences of noise, palm print, and false veins, and obtain a clear enhanced image of the palm vein. Experiment results carried out on two public databases and a self-built database yield the equal error rates of 0.0004, 0.0451, and 0.0395 and correct recognition rates of 99.96%, 94.50%, and 94.89%, respectively.

The first is to choose the proper VM (service) to handle the request, and the second is to map each VM (service) onto a proper physical machine (server). In this paper, we first put forward a heuristic algorithm to enhance the resource utilizations in a heterogenous data center and then propose a cascaded fuzzy dynamic programming (CFDP) method to do joint optimization of tasks and VM migrations to pursue long-term and maximum rewards with multi-objectives, which refer to performance benefits, energy consumptions, cooling costs for hot-spots, penalties for unfinished requests before deadline and VM migration costs. CFDP can learn from characteristics of incoming requests, does not rely on priori prediction of request arrivals, and considers both current and future impacts in the process of decision-making. Besides, value function approximation method is used to cope with state explosions and guarantee high scheduling speed at the same time. Finally, a group of experiments with both synthetic and realistic workloads are conducted, and QoS comparisons verify the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

569,569,Auto-updating portable application model of multi-cloud marketplace through bidirectional transformations system," All rights reserved.At present, the cloud marketplace becomes more and more widely used for delivering cloud applications to consumers. The diversity of IaaS and PaaS services from many cloud providers gives customers many choices that benefit them the most. If a customer is not satisfied with his existing cloud resource service (IaaS or PaaS), he is going to stop using the service in use and consider other cloud service providers. And he also wants his cloud software bought on the market to be hosted on new cloud platforms. However, changing cloud resource services for multi-cloud application is not trivial. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses a Composable Application Model (CAM) to construct the topology of a multi-cloud application in a Blueprint. Thereby, all the changes of cloud platform services are reflected to the Blueprint. In this way, the cloud application is managed. Thus, cloud application operation is guaranteed after one or several of its software components are re-deployed on new cloud platform services and re-established application interconnections so that the operation of the cloud application is as an initial state. For updating the Blueprint, we built a bidirectional transformation system where the core is a bidirectional transformation program.

573,573,PRARS: Risk assessment model for recommender systems," All rights reserved.Recommender systems play a vital role in web-based information systems, especially in the domain of e-commerce. Most of these systems provide their recommendation based on user's preferences. However, based on different situations of the user, their preferences can differ. Providing recommendations based only on the user's preferences and ignoring their situation can be risky and can lead to inaccurate recommendations resulting in poor acceptance and a non-purchase. The aim of this research is to evaluate the risk of a user not purchasing before providing a recommendation to an ecommerce user. The proposed model classifies sessions as risky or non-risky, which indicates the likelihood of the session containing a purchase. The risk calculation is based on two perspectives and seven factors. We evaluate the work experimentally and use three metrics, which are True Positive Rate, True Negative Rate, and AUC (area under curve) of ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve. The proposed model outperforms two state of the art algorithms on two different real world datasets, as measured by the AUC. The highest AUC of ROC is 0.97 when the users' sessions history is included, and the lowest AUC of ROC is 0.79 when the users' sessions history is not included.

Due to the spatial database is constantly changing as time goes on, the incremental mining of prevalent co-location pattern algorithms have been proposed in the literature. And focusing on the ignorance of the proximity level between instances, the co-location pattern mining based on fuzzy neighborhood relationship (FNR) has also been studied. However, the problem of incremental mining of prevalent co-location patterns based on fuzzy neighborhood relationship on the dynamic databases has not been addressed. In this paper, based on FNR, by capturing the changed (added and decreased) fuzzy neighborhood relationships, we define the incremental fuzzy participation index for measuring the prevalence of the changed co-location in the updated data sets, and design the algorithm of incremental mining of prevalent co-location patterns based on FNR (the IMPCP-FNR algorithm).

And the cumulative variance contribution rate is 81.066%. The comprehensive evaluation results of factor analysis are: (1) Under the same condition, the increase of temperature leads to the increase of ammonia concentration in piggery; (2) With the increase of humidity, ammonia concentration increased in the piggery; (3) Compared with other gas pollutants such as carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia, hydrogen sulfide concentration is relatively low in livestock and poultry. The above conclusions are consistent with the relevant literature and the actual situation. Therefore, the factor analysis method is suitable for analysis of environmental quality in pig house.

587,587,A novel borehole video expansion and mosaic algorithm for un-aligned hole and camera centers," All rights reserved.Traditionally, the video panorama expansion algorithms were basically based on the assumption of the alignment of hole center and camera center. In real applications, due to hardware limitations, the borehole video image in the actual resource survey and acquisition project was obtained under the condition that the center of the borehole and the camera were not aligned. To solve the difficult task of obtaining panoramic images from borehole imagers and eliminate distortion in the resultant image for centers unaligned situation, this paper proposes a new borehole video image processing algorithm. Firstly, the image was expanded by using the ideal model (the aligned situation data), finding the corresponding circular region, and proper interpolating manipulation. The expanded image contains the cylinder hole wall information within certain depth scope but has some kind of distortion. Then by using least square fitting method and adopting the initial phase optimization estimation method, we obtained the high-order polynomial fitting depth direction correction curve. And the expanded images are corrected frame by frame. Lastly, the displacement of the horizontal direction is searched by the template region matching method, and the panoramic image of the borehole wall is obtained by pixel-level data fusion. The experimental results are evaluated. The peak signal-to-noise ratio of the algorithm is 21.0907 and the structural similarity is 0.7976 in terms of objective metric. While subjectively the average of the proposed algorithm is 3.6. Both objective and subjective measure are better than the existing algorithm. The resultant images are more intuitive than the original video.",60003977,Northwestern Polytechnical University,Xi'an,China,['1702'],19.53846153846154,0.13602597402597405,0.38603896103896107,0
588,588,Hypergraph clustering by generating large pure hyperedges using greedy neighborhood search," All rights reserved.Pairwise similarity between data points is usually computed in the traditional clustering methods. But in many cases, especially for high dimensional data in computer vision, it is required that more than two data points should be involved in representing the similarities. In this case, hypergraph clustering is an ideal tool for data analysis, where high order similarities on the data subsets, represented by hyperedges, can reflect the similarity among more than two data points. Hypergraph clustering usually includes hypergraph construction and hypergraph partition. Two important questions in hypergraph construction are how to generate the hyperedges and how many hyperedges should be used to represent the original data. Recently, Pulak Purkait et al. have proposed a method for generating the large pure hyperedges, which is proved to be more effective than the traditional methods for computer vision tasks. However, the method needs a specified number of hyperedges in advance, and uses random sampling to generate hyperedges, which may lead to suboptimal clustering results. Therefore, a novel sampling method called greedy neighborhood search is proposed in this work, which generates large pure hyperedges based on Shared Reverse k Nearest Neighbors (SRNN) and learns the number of hyperedges simultaneously. Experiments show the benefits of applying the proposed method on high dimensional data .",60073730,Hexi University,Zhangye,China,['1702'],21.3,0.2222670807453416,0.5772670807453416,0

Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has received wide attention because of its interpretability. However, existing multi-view clustering methods based on NMF are vulnerable to outliers and noise. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel model, named graph regularized multiple nonnegative matrix factorization with L2,1 norm (GRMNMF) method, for exploring multi-view data.

Inspired by this idea, in this study, we introduce the extension principle for PLTSs and then define the operations of PLTSs. A novel representation of the PLTS is given.

596,596,Thermal infrared ensemble tracker with an algorithm using Kullback-Leibler divergence," All rights reserved.Thermal infrared tracking (TIR) is able to track objects in dark environments such as night. It can be used mainly for surveillance and rescue for surveillance cameras at night. While the development of automatic driving is progressing in recent years, we believe that thermal infrared tracking can contribute to the improvement of safety even in places with few streetlights. However, unlike normal visual object tracking, thermal infrared tracking itself has some problems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for improving the accuracy by selecting the optimal feature map for each sequence using Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) amount for ensemble tracking using the powerful expression ability of convolutional neural network (CNN). Using KLDs from response maps obtained from an ensemble tracker with multi-layer convolutional features in thermal infrared tracking (MCFTS), we determine the CNN filter most involved in creating the response map. By adjusting the bias value corresponding to these filters and learning the filter, it is possible to create a tracker corresponding to the sequence each time. In order to evaluate the performance of the tracker and conventional tracker which applied the proposed algorithm, we experimented with the thermal infrared tracking benchmark of VOT-TIR2016. We also compared the 24 types of trackers that were evaluated in the thermal infrared tracking benchmark.

Second, three machine learning algorithms are used to learn sentiment classification for brand affect, namely support vector machines, random forests, and deep belief networks. Through the comparison of the resulting classification accuracy from the experimental results, the best model is selected and the brand's negative emotional comments are obtained. Third, the word frequencies of these negative comments are obtained and the monthly trends of the proportion of high-frequency words and negative emotional comments are calculated.

It is one of important problems to approximate an unknown true density function from training data selected from the true density function independently and identically using learning models. In a stochastic model, many hierarchical learning models for analyzing real data have been proposed, and proved to be effective. They are, however, singular, which classic theories for regular models cannot apply to. Therefore, the need for appropriate model selection methods for singular models has increased and several information criteria for singular models have been developed. For example, singular Bayesian information criterion, widely applicable information criterion, widely applicable Bayesian information criterion, and cross-validation have been considered based on mathematical theorems in algebraic analysis and geometry. In this paper, we consider learning coefficients in learning theory, which serve to measure the main term of learning efficiency in singular learning models.

615,615,Multivariate normal distribution based over-sampling for numerical and categorical features," All rights reserved.Imbalanced data classification is an important task in data mining and machine learning. Imbalanced data consists of majority class and minority class, where the majority class leads to miss-classification of minority samples. Various approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this problem. Sampling, which focuses on balancing between classes, is one of the methods to solve the class imbalance problem. In previous our research, we have proposed Multivariate Normal Distribution based Over-Sampling (MNDO), which uses correlations between attributes and statistical methods, and have tackled this problem. In this paper, we propose Multivariate Normal Distribution based Over-sampling for Numerical and Categorical features (MNDO-NC) to sampling a dataset that contains both numerical data and categorical data. First, MNDO-NC generates numerical data using correlation coefficients and multivariate distribution. Next, calculate the distance between the generated data and the original data, and identify 5 nearest neighbors. The categorical data is sampled by applying a voting strategy for the neighborhood sample. Some existing methods generate new samples using distance function, but our method uses positive class statistics. Therefore, it can be applied even if the number of training samples is very small. In addition, outliers can be reproduced stochastically, so more realistic samples can be generated.

616,616,Improve student performance prediction using ensemble model for higher education," All rights reserved.In higher education institutions, the most significant issue is to improve the students' performance and retention rate. Massive numbers of students' data are used to gain new hidden knowledge from students' learning behaviour, particularly to discover the initial symptom of at-risk students by using Educational Data Mining techniques. However, data with noises, outliers and irrelevant information might cause an inaccurate result. This study aims to develop a robust students' performance prediction model for higher education institution by identifying features of students' data that have the potential to increase performance prediction results, comparing and identifying the most suitable ensemble learning technique after preprocessing the data and optimizing the hyperparameters. Data are collected from 2 different systems, which are: student information system and e-learning system of undergraduate students from the Faculty of Engineering in one of Malaysia's public university. 4413 students' instances are used for this study. The process follows 6 different data mining phases namely: data collection, data integration, data preprocessing (such as cleaning, normalization, and transformation), feature selection, patterns extraction and finally model optimization and evaluation. Machine learning techniques used to build prediction model are Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network, while for ensemble learning: Random Forest, Bagging, Stacking, Majority Vote and 2 variants of Boosting techniques are AdaBoost and XGBoost.

HEVC introduces a more flexible division structure based on quadtree coding block and 35 intra prediction modes, and results in high video compression performance for intra prediction of HEVC.

Traditional EMA method is based on the assumption of linear mode theory, which is easy to cause pseudo-mode. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a de-theorizing EMA method. In order to solve the problem of obtaining modal parameters without theorizing, a method using data mining is proposed in this paper. As a data mining method, symbolic regression can obtain modal parameters by only mining function expression rules from single point response data.

Countryside terrain is rugged, and cars need good equipment and technological design to drive safely. Hill Climb Racing is a physics-based driving video game and has demonstrated its potential of applying statistical data-driven and engineering problem-solving. The authors selected Jeep as vehicle and countryside landscape of Hill Climb Racing game, and used definitive screen design (DSD) to study what equipment had most influence on Jeep travelling distance on countryside terrain. To ensure the DSD structure, three examination criteria, including power analysis, confounding color-map analysis and uniformity analysis were conducted. The authors also conducted DSD optimization to build predictive modeling of Jeep performance on countryside terrain. The first model revealed that suspension and four-wheel drive (4WD) are the top two important factors, and the r-squared adjusted statistic was around 0.68. After model improvement and validation run, the r-squared and r-squared adjusted for the final model are 0.95 and 0.92. Suspension and 4WD remain the two most significant terms, while Suspension*4WD and Suspension*Suspension are also of significance.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to 2D+3D FER using orthogonal low rank Tucker decomposition (OLRTDFER). First, a new 4D tensor is built by stacking nine kinds of feature from 2D textured images and 3D face scans. Then, under a Tucker decomposition of this tensor, the low-rankness is imposed on the involved core tensor due to the high similarity of samples during projecting the three-dimensional face scans into the two-dimensional planes. Meanwhile the sparse representation of the factor matrix involved is carried out to avoid its denseness. Finally, a tensor completion is then embedded because the information is partly missed in the process of generating this 4D tensor.

634,634,Discovering spatial co-location patterns by automatically determining the instance neighbor," All rights reserved.Spatial co-location pattern mining is an effective technique for identifying a group of features whose instances frequently located in geographical proximity. The distance between instances in space is commonly used to evaluate the proximity of them. If the distance between two instances is smaller than a distance threshold specified by users, they have a neighbor relationship. However, the neighbor relationships of instances determined in this way are ambiguous and it is difficult for users to set a suitable distance threshold. In addition, the neighbor relationships ignore the distribution of instances themselves, it is hard to deal with heterogeneous distribution density datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method based on the constrained Delaunay triangulation to determine neighborhoods of instances without distance thresholds for mining co-location patterns. First, applying the Delaunay triangulation to coarsely materialize the neighbor relationships of instances into an undirected connected graph. Then, we impose two strategies to constrain the Delaunay triangulation to prune undue edges. Finally, we develop a mining algorithm which can avoid the time-consuming generate-test candidate model which is widely used in previous algorithms.

This kind of applications increasingly relies on a network of connected objects which are present in the environment of elderly or sick people. It deals with exploiting the connected objects of this environment to offer a service (e.g., fall detection, localization) to these persons. Since the environment is dynamic, due to the availability or the lack of connected objects and to the diversity of situations, cooperation mechanisms among connected objects must be dynamically and adaptively designed. The proposed approach emphasizes the cooperation between these different connected objects. This work is based on cooperative multiagent systems in which each agent models a connected object. We will leverage interaction protocols in multiagent systems in order to design a platform capable of generating an adaptive multiagent systems automatically. The adaptation takes into consideration the context of the person as well as the existing interaction protocols.

In this pursuit, the present work envisages the steering control based on an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode, by combining the fuzzy theory and the sliding mode control. Initially, the steering angle model of the tracked robot was deduced, and the characteristics of the DC servo motor were analyzed. Subsequently, a time-varying sliding surface with integral terms was designed to construct the adaptive control based fuzzy sliding mode on the equivalent control and the switching control. Based on fuzzy logic, the equivalent control used the sliding mode surface and its rate of change as the input of the fuzzy system, which were approximated to the equivalent control according to the simplified calculation of the fuzzy system output. This not only kept the rapidity and robustness of the sliding mode control, but also well suppressed the buffeting problem of the sliding mode control. The simulation and experimental results showed that the proposed control not only had strong robustness against the external disturbance and parameter perturbation, but also had the characteristics of a fast dynamic response and good tracking performance, when compared with the conventional sliding mode control method, thus making it applicable to the control system of the tracked robot.",60015487,Anhui Agricultural University,Hefei,China,['1702'],31.285714285714285,0.08936507936507936,0.40714285714285714,0

648,648,Managing missing values in intuitionistic reciprocal preference relations: From numeric procedures to granular," All rights reserved.In decision making it has been generally assumed that the decision maker possesses the enough knowledge about the whole problem and she or he is able to distinguish the degree up to which an option is better than other one. However, this may be impractical in real world situations, which can involve many options to select from information sources that can be dynamic and conflicting. Therefore, different procedures for estimating incomplete information have been developed in the literature, which principally deal with fuzzy preference relations. In this research, and different from the existing procedures that deal with fuzzy preference relations, we introduce a procedure based on granular computing to estimate missing values in intuitionistic reciprocal preference relations. In particular, we describe how the granular computing can be used to estimate missing information so that the estimated values lead to complete intuitionistic reciprocal preference relations with consistency levels as high as possible. The results show that the procedure based on granular computing is able to increase the consistency level achieved by the existing procedures dealing with missing values in intuitionistic reciprocal preference relations.",60030835,University of Alberta,Edmonton,Canada,['1702'],30.833333333333332,0.11258333333333334,0.42074999999999996,0

The official morbidity levels were taken as initial data; for numerical modelling, the SIR model was applied to take into account the birth rate, mortality, as well as chemoprophylaxis and isolation of a group of infected but not epidemically dangerous patients. The search for the coefficients of the model is examined in detail using gradient descent with an auxiliary system applied. Various scenarios of the epidemic development are estimated, depending on the percentage of the number of patients who are undergoing therapy. The consequences of achieving the goals of the UNAIDS strategy 90-90-90 (90% people who are aware of their status, 90% among them are on HIV treatment and 90% among them are virally suppressed) are described. It is shown that upon reaching the target levels of involvement of patients in anti-epidemic measures, the number of infected people can be kept within 1% of the total population with a further decrease.",60031888,Saint Petersburg State University,Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,['1700'],28.5,-0.049999999999999996,0.42857142857142855,0
650,650,Generating data to alleviate data imbalance problems in machine learning," All rights reserved.In this study, we address the problem of imbalanced data reducing machine learning performance. An analysis of the problem indicates that it is caused by differing amounts of data in each class and too few features in the minority class data. To address these issues, we propose a generative model that creates sufficient additional minority class data to eliminate the imbalance in the data amounts. This can also resolve the issue of a lack of minority class features. The proposed method is based on a neural network that uses the squared error as its error function, which is easy to calculate. The generated data is combined with the original minority class data, thereby reducing the proportion of generated data used and any effects due to differences between the generated and original data. We also expect that adding generated data will supplement the number of minority class features seen in the original data. Experiments evaluating our proposed method with artificial data show that it yielded a higher AUC value than that of undersampling. These results demonstrate that the proposed method can be an effective approach for addressing imbalanced datasets with small amounts of minority class data.",60004526,Future University - Hakodate,Hakodate,Japan,['1702'],22.0,0.12333333333333334,0.6258333333333334,0
651,651,Automated data-flow analysis and validation in process automation projects," All rights reserved.Process-driven applications (PDAs) rely on a combination of executable process models and code that implements individual process steps. These step implementations rely on process variables that maintain state across process steps and are used to take decisions on alternative execution paths, i. e. they hold data received from and saved to (external) backend systems. As a result, the data flow of a PDA can become complex even if each step implementation is kept simple. Complexity arises from various possibilities for manipulating process variables, in addition to the variety of execution paths that make it difficult to keep track of process variables. We propose a static analysis approach for managing or reducing complexity by limiting the solution space of implementations. It checks assertions on the data flow in PDAs while taking process variables into account. Assertions are specified using our novel data-flow validation language (DFVL). For demonstration, DFVL and automated assertion checking are implemented as part of an open source process application validation tool. The tool facilitates the use of DFVL for automated static analyses in the same way as unit tests are used for software testing. A short evaluation shows the applicability of our approach and tool.",115455666,Viadee Unternehmensberatung AG,Munster,Germany,['1702'],16.666666666666664,0.018181818181818177,0.49837662337662336,0
652,652,Discovering spatial co-location patterns under considering the distribution of spatial features," All rights reserved.As science and technology advance, massive data, such as spatial data in smart city application, have been collected. It has gradually become an important problem to mine prevalent co-location patterns from massive spatial data. Spatial co-location pattern mining is a very important research branch in the field of spatial data mining. A spatial co-location pattern is a set of spatial features which instances have frequently neighbor relationships each other in space. The traditional co-location mining method usually gives a single neighbor threshold to measure the neighbor relationship between instances, and the spatial distribution of instances of different spatial feature is not to be consistent. To solve the above problem, as explained by Tobler's first law, with the distance increases, the contribution of instances to the importance of patterns decreases, so the distance weight of instances is proposed. The influential threshold is defined from the distribution of feature instances. A spatial co-location pattern mining algorithm based on kernel density estimation model with influential threshold is proposed. Experiments are carried out in synthetic and real data sets. The results show that the algorithm improves effectiveness and efficiency compared with the traditional methods.",60028009,Yunnan University,Kunming,China,['1702'],19.3,0.08752100840336136,0.5509103641456583,0
653,653,A study of email author identification using machine learning for business email compromise," All rights reserved.Recently, Business Email Compromise (BEC) has become a big issue. Some security companies and organizations warn about BEC and say that we must defend against them. Although we have many SPAM filters, we have very few BEC filters. We have to find BEC by ourselves. One of the features of BEC is that the wording and style in BEC differ usual. If a software finds this point, it can help us to defend against BEC. Based on this idea, we propose a method to identify an email author using machine learning algorithms. In this approach, we make identification models from emails received in the past. We defined a target person in advance and use machine learning algorithms to make models which identify whether an email is sent by this person or not. We translate an email to a feature vector which consists of the similarity between the subject and the body, the distribution of Part of Speech and the occurrence of terms in the beginning part of the body. We make models from these feature vectors using machine learning algorithms, KNN, SVM, NBC and Decision Tree. And we try to identify whether a target person write a new email or not, with these models. We evaluated these approaches using open dataset and tools. The best accuracy is about 0.84 and the best Kappa statistics value is 0.68, therefore, our approach shows good agreement. However, we can get the better Kappa statistics value using a simple method. That is, we could not show the advantage of our approach. Overfitting is one of the reasons why our approach could not be better than an existing approach. We have to modify this weakness using literature resources and other approaches. Moreover, we have to evaluate our new approach using the bigger dataset.

First, the data set of road crack was constructed, which contains four types of pictures: single crack, transverse crack, patched crack, and no crack. A total of 8,400 pictures were taken, laying a foundation for the construction and training of subsequent models. Then, based on the VGG-16 network model, the model optimizes the number of fully connected layers and replaces the SoftMax classifier in the original VGG-16 network with a 4-label SoftMax classifier. These changes optimize the model structure and parameters, and then use the migration learning method to train the self-built data set. The final test accuracy of the model is 95%. In terms of average recognition accuracy, this research model and VGG-16NET are superior to AlexNET and GoogleNET. From the test results, the research model is slightly better than the VGG-16NET model, which has better classification performance for the road crack category and can accurately distinguish between single cracks, transverse cracks, patched cracks and no cracks. The realization of automatic identification and classification of road cracks plays an important role in saving labor costs, effectively implementing road maintenance and ensuring driving safety.",60028891,Chang'an University,Xi'an,China,['1702'],23.666666666666668,0.25547619047619047,0.5785714285714287,0

In this article, we discuss two kinds of k-nearest neighbor classifier (wk-NNC) weighted by different methods, and adjusted weights with n-fold cross validation for better classification performance. In fact, it is not enough to describe the performance of one classifier only depending on the classification accuracy. So we refer to the variance and the accuracy for performance comparison in this article. We develop experiments on different datasets (such as HEART, WINE, and HILL-VALLEY, downloaded from UCI), and compare the performance of wk-NNC under n=3, or 10 folds cross validation for adjusting the weights. The results show that (1) the instance wk-NNC is relatively more stable than the attribute wk-NNC when the dataset size is changed, (2) comparing the variance, the classifier performance is better when the fold number increase, just like on the datasets HEART and WINE, (3) if the dimension is greater than 100, the n-fold cross validation is failed, such as on the dataset HILL-VALLEY.

After we analyze previous related works, we propose to combine hierarchical clustering and support vector regression (SVR) methods to obtain a predictive model. Firstly, we find the development level is similar to Hainan province (Guangxi province) using hierarchical cluster method. Secondly, we obtain the optimal SVR model (C=1024, g=0.0013811) by means of k-fold cross validation (k-CV) based on the sufficient samples of Guangxi province. After comparing the SVR model with the multiple linear regression prediction method, the result shows that has better prediction accuracy.

A health index was constructed considering different coffee nutritions, including: saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, and caffeine. Antioxidant activity of flavonoids from Caffeine component can reduce free radical formation and scavenge free radicals. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to explore all factors in the analysis and to inform on the utility of the health index in relation to its link to CVD prevention. Principle Component 1 is more relevant to unhealthy components such as sugars, carbohydrates, saturated fat, and total fat. Principle Component 2 is more related to Caffeine. Additionally, Dietary Fiber and Caffeine are most opposite against the other unhealthy components along the direction of the 1st Principle Component. PCA Eigen Analysis is very powerful to recognize coffee product types based on Nutrition patterns. In order to avoid variance factor in PCA analysis, original data has been Z-transformed.

We consider a scenario, in which the network traffic data have large volumes and high dimensionality, and follow different patterns. To detect anomalies accurately and efficiently, a K-means and Bayesian inference based Conditional Random Fields (KBCRF) method is proposed here. Specifically, we first adopt a K-clustering method to categorize the network data into manifold classes so as to alleviate the interference from data with different patterns. Also, we propose a data reduction method via Bayesian inference to filter irrelevant data features, hence improving the performance of data training and anomaly detection. Then, we propose a Conditional Random Fields based method to determine the anomalies in the network data, upon the conditional probability of anomaly given the data distribution. For cyber security maintenance, KBCRF method provides more accurate and faster anomaly detection, compared with existing detection methods. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by the ISCX 2012 dataset.

Then these base models with different network structures are performed to constitute an ensemble. Our original personal identification dataset is employed as the numerical example to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.

In particular, EEG is noticed because it is non-invasive and inexpensive. However, it is difficult to perform recognition with high accuracy because there are a number of problems such as EEG signals have a lot of noise. The high accuracy analysis of EEG is the subject of research by many researchers. In this paper, we propose converting EEG signals into images and performing emotion classification tasks using CNN. In the experiment, we use DEAP dataset, which is often used in emotion recognition tasks using EEG. The EEG signal is divided into short segments based on a predetermined time window and plotted in time series data format to generate images. About the data plotting method, the image is generated by the method of making 32 classes and the method of making 4 classes. The generated images are classified into each emotions using a convolutional neural network. The classification use two axes, arousal and valence. The best results differ by gender. Men are able to get the best results when the time window is 1.0 with a 4-class image. The accuracy at these results is 63.75% for arousal and 63.36% for valence. The time window is 1.5 seconds and arousal is 65.37% when women use 4-class images. On the other hand, valence is 59.96% in 1.5 seconds when using a 32-class image.

Considering the difference of knowledge level among experts and the nonhereditary characteristics of preference information in each stage, we use this formula to calculate the weight of experts under each attribute.

671,671,Stability of weak solutions of parabolic systems with distributed parameters on the graph," All rights reserved.The analysis of the behaviour of the evolutionary equation solution with unlimited time variable has been a subject of discussion in scientific circles for a long time. There are many practical reasons for this when the initial conditions of the equation are specified with a certain error: how the small changes in the initial conditions affect the behaviour of the solution for large values of the time. The paper uses the classical understanding of the stability of the solution of a differential equation or a system of equations that goes back to the works of A. M. Lyapunov: a solution is stable if it little changes under the small perturbations of the initial condition. In the work specified the stability conditions for the solution of an evolutionary parabolic system with distributed parameters on a graph describing the process of transfer of a continuous mass in a spatial network are indicated. The parabolic system is considered in the weak formulation: a weak solution of the system is a summable function that satisfies the integral form identity, which determines the variational formulation for the initial-boundary value problem. By going beyond the classical (smooth) solutions and addressing weak solutions of the problem the authors aim not only to describe more precisely the physical nature of the transfer processes (this takes on particular importance when studying the dynamics of multiphase media) but also to the path analysis processes in multidimensional network-like domains. The used approach is based on a priori estimates of the weak solution and the construction (the Fayedo-Galerkin method with a special basis - the system of eigenfunctions of the elliptic operator of a parabolic equation) of a weakly compact family of approximate solutions in the selected state space. The obtained results underlie the analysis of optimal control problems for differential systems with distributed parameters on a graph, which have interesting analogies with multiphase problems of multidimensional hydrodynamics.",60072688,Universidade Eduardo Mondlane,Maputo,Mozambique,['1700'],31.9,0.0026147959183673475,0.41449829931972787,0
672,672,Building ontology profiles with contextual elements for effective and efficient movies recommendation," All rights reserved.In coping with the increasing on-demand movies services provided through the Internet or Cloud platform, on-demand movies providers are competing intensively in providing more varieties and choices of programs. To retain and attract more users, service providers are moving towards recommending more personalized programs to satisfy users' needs and preferences. While the number of users and items are increasing, the effectiveness and efficiency of the recommendation become the main factors to address. This paper proposes to integrate ontological profiles with contextual elements based on hybrid recommendation approach. In this proposed system, namely HyOC-RS, ontological profile is incorporated with contextual elements to improve the recommendation mechanism. A semantically and hierarchically-linked data model represented the proposed ontological user profile. Performance of HyOC-RS is evaluated in terms of time and space complexity. HyOC-RS with small error measures has proven to be more efficient and accurate as compared to traditional recommendation systems. Additionally, experimental results have shown that HyOC-RS could resolve the problems inherent in many of the traditional content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation systems such as over specialization, data sparsity, new user, and new item problems.",60012005,Multimedia University,Malacca Town,Malaysia,['1702'],20.666666666666668,0.22781385281385283,0.5125541125541125,0

675,675,An efficient approach for selecting initial centroid and outlier detection of data clustering," All rights reserved.In recent years, vast amounts of unstructured data have been and are being produced from multiple sources around the world. In the field of data mining, clustering is the most efficient technique for grouping such unstructured or unsupervised data. In its basic form, data clustering is an unsupervised method that groups or cluster objects so that all objects within the same cluster are very similar to each other, whereas objects grouped similarly in the different clusters are quite distinct. However, due to the exponential growth of data amounts available in a wide variety of scientific fields, it has become increasingly difficult to manipulate and analyze such information. In addition, it is becoming progressively more cumbersome to extract hidden features from the resulting huge unstructured and unsupervised datasets. This study reports on an improved general k-means clustering algorithm that was created by modifying its initial centroid selection process and adding a new outlier detection and filtering algorithm. Under normal conditions, most algorithms select initial centroids randomly, which often leads to poor initial cluster quality. Additionally, most existing outlier detection techniques are inadequate due to their poor accuracy levels, high computational complexity, and inability to identify outlier data. In contrast, after an analysis of comprehensive experiments performed to validate our approach via comparisons against existing techniques and benchmark performance values, we found that our proposed approach performs better than existing methods in terms of initial centroid selection, outlier detection, and other related matters.",60031404,The University of Aizu,Aizuwakamatsu,Japan,['1702'],27.11111111111111,0.05209728867623604,0.43283891547049436,0

Current trajectory planning methods focus on very well-known tasks and in very well-known conditions. However, limited by maximal detection range of sensors or outdated intelligence, a key challenge is developing a fast real-time method that generating solutions for tasks in uncertain environments where traditional methods may not be available. This article seeks to combine the advantages of popular convex optimization and proposes trajectory stitching technique, to create a new approach that combines computational efficiency and optimal performance with uncertain no-fly zone constraints. Our approach first plans a baseline trajectory based on the initial guess by convex optimization.

686,686,Technique for annotation of fuzzy models: A semantic fuzzy mining approach," All rights reserved.The fuzzy models have shown to be ambiguous and characteristically primitive in nature when applied for data analysis problems in most settings. This is owing to the fact that with fuzzy models, it may not be practically possible to extract meaningful information about the underlying process elements when confronted with datasets that are unstructured in nature. To this end, the work in this paper demonstrates that it is possible to extract abstract knowledge and improve the information values of such type of models to a greater level by carefully integrating and tuning the semantics metrics that the fuzzy models lack. Theoretically, the work introduces a semantic fuzzy mining approach that is particularly focused on making use of the fuzzy logic and theories to represent the imprecise and uncertain (unstructured) data about the different domain processes, and then presents the resulting models in a format that allows one to analyse the available datasets based on concepts rather than the tags or labels in the events logs about the processes in question. In other words, this paper adopts the fuzzy logic which permits a proposal to be in another state as true or false, and in turn, evaluates the outcomes of the method using a series of case study experimentation and its comparison against the other benchmark algorithms used for process mining. The result shows that it is possible to determine through the classification process (e.g. using a classifier/reasoner) the presence of different patterns or traces that can be found within the discovered models, as well as the relationships the different process elements share amongst themselves within the knowledge-base.

700,700,Study on asymmetric deflection control scheme of SDR for flying wing aircraft," All rights reserved.Compared with conventional configuration aircraft, tailless flying wing configuration aircraft has a longer wing span than chord length. Aircraft with such aerodynamic characteristic has a shorter pitch arm and its pitch trim ability is insufficient when climbing at low speed and high angle of attack. Therefore, further exploring the aerodynamic efficiency of aircraft control surface and improving the pitch trim ability become a problem to be studied. The flying wing aircraft mostly adopts the split resistance rudder (SDR) symmetrical deflection to realize the stable control of the aircraft course; such an approach is simple and effective, but it reduces the control efficiency of the surface. So we want to explore the SDR asymmetric deflection control scheme to enhance the pitch control capability of the aircraft. In this paper, the dynamic modeling of SDR asymmetric deflection is studied and the mathematical model of over-drive system is established. The control effectiveness of SDR asymmetric deflection and symmetric deflection is compared by solving its attainable moment subset. The simulation results show that: Compared with symmetrical deflection, the pitch moment of asymmetric deflection control scheme increased by 47.5%. It can achieve greater pitch trim ability and control ability.",60003977,Northwestern Polytechnical University,Xi'an,China,['1702'],21.88888888888889,0.11926739926739928,0.42212454212454215,0

With the development of Internet technology, people are increasingly exposed to different types of cultural forms. However, we can not deny the fact that especially in recent years, people have largely neglected the study of traditional culture in our country and more advocated foreign culture, which also caused the rapid sense of loss of traditional culture. In order to let the public inherit the traditional culture better, this paper aims to study whether the celebrities can play an important role in the inheritance and development of the traditional culture. Considering the domestic star-chasing craze, firstly we explore the star's festival influence from the perspective of the star's Sina Weibo influence. Then, by mining the micro-blogs related to the stars, we use the Naive Bayes classifier and natural language processing technology to calculate the emotional value of the micro-blogs and discover the importance of celebrity effect in traditional festivals by studying the positive sentiment ratio of the relevant micro-blogs.

706,706,Application of clustering in modeling user preference for leisure," All rights reserved.Multiple commercial systems focus on recommending suitable leisure activities to their users, yet little academic research has explored how to describe and model user preference for leisure. This paper investigates dimension-based and clustering-based approaches to modeling such preference. We rated a set of 135 leisure activities on 17 leisure dimensions in a user study, and relied on these dimensions as feature vectors to cluster the 135 leisure activities using k-means and its fuzzy variant. Another user study collected user preference for the 135 activities to be used as the ground truth. The 17 dimension and resulting clusters were then tested as descriptors of user preference in a series of linear regressions. We expected that the user would tend to like or dislike all activities in a hard cluster, since such activities would be similar to each other, and the user would like them to a similar extent. We further expected that a partial membership in a fuzzy cluster would correlate with the user preference for an activity if the user liked or disliked the underlying cluster. The results suggested that clustering could indeed be used to describe leisure preference. Hard clustering appeared to be more effective than fuzzy clustering, but both of them could be combined for an even more effective approach to preference modeling than using them separately. Finally, clustering could be combined with the four most effective of the 17 leisure dimensions to account for 27% of variance in the user preference for leisure. Such result suggests that a combination of leisure dimensions and cluster membership can be used as leisure activity features, which may be suitable for and useful in content-based and hybrid leisure recommendation systems.",60015986,Universit√† degli Studi di Trento,Trento,Italy,['1702'],25.636363636363637,0.14459876543209876,0.5058641975308643,0

Hateful wording as such involves communications that unlawfully demean any group or person based on certain characteristics, including colour, race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or nationality. The continuing rise of internet social platforms, including micro blogging services like Twitter, has compelled the need for more immediate analyses of hatreds and other antagonistic responses to various trigger events. This study aims to investigate the details using aspect-based inspections of sentiments. Content analysis of such tweets along with the associations between them is key. Nevertheless, due to the large data volumes involved, it can oftentimes be burdensome if not infeasible to conduct these types of analyses manually. The main problems of prior methods involve data sparsity, classification accuracy, and sarcastic content identification. for the techniques incorrectly categorise tweets as neutral.

708,708,Clustering botnet behavior using K-means with uncertain data," All rights reserved.Botnets are the most deadly threat in the network due to the capability of exploiting resources within a network as an army to launch huge attacks such as Denial-Distributed-of-Service (DDOS) or spam emails. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that designed based on the behavior of botnets in network traffic is seen as the promising technique in detecting botnets that are hiding by using encryption technique or any hiding techniques. This paper proposes on K-means clustering algorithm as the first phase of botnet's behaviour detection model that extracts data from network traffic. The criterion highlighted for our behaviour detection model is that it should be able to detect botnet in encrypted packets(hiding techniques), structure-independent (centralized and peer-to-peer), requiring minimal computing resources and minimal time processing. Other than that, by representing the real-time of network traffics, the detection model also must be resistant to noise and able to identify the anomaly of botnets behavior among a huge number of normal traffic. We are using the botnet benchmark dataset and normal traffic from Malware Capture Facility Project and comparing our proposed method using K-means algorithm with Expectation Maximization algorithm that proposed by the previous researcher in clustering the similar pattern of botnet behavior. The result shows that the K-means algorithm producing much higher accuracy, 94% and lower false negative rate, 0.1413.

Compared with the conventional phase-locked loop, this one is significantly able to reduce the settling time with hybrid approaches. By employing direct presetting frequency, based on frequency-locked loop(FLL), the process locking is accelerated. To achieve low phase noise, 20-bits delta-sigma modulator is employed in PLL. Dynamic bandwidth is beneficial for both of them and results a smooth transition.

The particular task of face recognition usually combines a softmax-loss function with some other loss function as the cost function in the training phase. In order to enhance the power of feature representation and speed up the training phase, this paper proposes a new supervised method called Improve-Center which is based on feature centers, the same as center-loss. It learns a center vector of features for every label and takes the feature of every sample closest to its center. This approach focuses on moving outer-space features closer to their center. The experimentation demonstrates that the approach is efficient.

Efficient implementation, high speed and high resolution require the DAC design architecture of choice to be the binary weighted. Therefore, the paper introduces a model to speed up the design and reflect accurately on the behavior of the system prior to component level development and implementation. Furthermore, some of the aspects of designing with binary weighted DAC architecture data devices are considered. The study also covers behavioral modelling of the binary weighted DAC device from an ideal function to reality. The DAC model in this paper yields static characteristics as follows: Gain error of 1 LSB; K of 1.6; Offset voltage of 97 uV; Integral Non-Linearity (INL) error of -3.94E-02 LSB minimum and 5.00E-01 LSB maximum; Differential Non-Linearity error of -3.92E-02 LSB minimum and 2.06E-01 LSB maximum; Step height of 9.61E-01 LSB minimum and 1.21E00 LSB maximum. The DAC model yields fair and practical results as the INL errors are less than or equal to 0.5 LSB; the DNL errors are less than or equal to 2.06E-01 LSB. Additionally, the above errors show that the model yields a design with monotonic behaviour.

And in many cases, people may want to know the distance range in which a colocation pattern is prevalent instead of a single distance threshold. In this paper, fuzzy neighbor relationship (FNR) is introduced to measure the proximity level between instances by fuzzy set theory. We propose the algorithm for prevalent colocation pattern mining at a single membership threshold (PCP-SMT), and develop the basic algorithm for prevalent colocation pattern mining with the maximum membership threshold (PCP-MMT). Furthermore, an improved strategy is adopted for the PCP-MMT algorithm. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms and the optimization technique are evaluated with an extensive set of experiments.",60028009,Yunnan University,Kunming,China,['1702'],22.285714285714285,0.05510204081632654,0.2715986394557823,0

729,729,"Social community, personal involvement and psychological processes: A study of impulse buying in the online shopping carnival","The pomp of online shopping carnivals (OSC) and herein the frenzy of impulse buying (IB) have been extensively reported in media but received insufficient attention in academics. This study researched both the IB formation and enactment stages in ""Double 11"" OSC by conducting a large-scale online survey. Regarding the formation stage, consumers' social community and personal involvement were identified as significant factors in promoting the urge to buy impulsively (UBI) in the OSC. Specifically, consumers' OSC involvement appeared as their carnival experiences including participation, interaction, and pleasure; The social community consisted of their connections with e-commerce platforms, e-merchants, the media, net friends, close friends, and relatives during the OSC. Regarding the IB enactment stage, the cognitive evaluation revealed either a positive or negative effect on moderating the UBI-IB relationship via the direct path or the outcome expectancy-mediated path, respectively. Meanwhile, outcome expectancy exerted a dominant mediating effect on the UBI-IB relationship as the cognitive evaluation became sufficiently negative. These results yield valuable insights into 1) the distinguished preconditions of the OSC context facilitating consumers' impulse formation, 2) consumers' impulsive and reflective psychological processes behind the IB decision-making. This study also contributes substantially to IB theories and practical knowledge of OSC.",60031419,Ningbo University,Ningbo,China,['1706'],25.0,-0.016504329004329,0.30622294372294373,1

FIT visitors usually use one hotel as a base: they leave from it, travel around various sightseeing areas using public transport, and return to their hotel the same day; in this paper, we term this the ""one-day circular tour"" (OCT). However, owing to restrictions with public transport schedules, it is difficult to visit many sightseeing areas efficiently and satisfactorily within a limited time. In this study, we present a planning algorithm for OCTs that offers high satisfaction when using public transport in this manner.

735,735,Leveraging AI-based Decision Support for Opportunity Analysis," All rights reserved.The dynamics and speed of change in corporate environments have increased. At the front-end of innovation, firms are challenged to evaluate growing amounts of information within shorter time frames in order to stay competitive. Either they spend significant time on structured data analysis, at the risk of delayed market launch, or they follow their intuition, at the risk of not meeting market trends. Both scenarios constitute a significant risk for a firm's continued existence. Motivated by this, a conceptual model is presented in this paper that aims at remediating these risks. Grounded on design science methodology, it concentrates on previous assessments of innovation search fields. These innovation search fields assist in environmental scanning and lay the foundation for deciding which opportunities to pursue. The model applies a novel AI-based approach, which draws on natural language processing and information retrieval. To provide decision support, the approach includes market-, technology-, and firm-related criteria. This allows us to replace intuitive decision-making by fact-based considerations. In addition, an often-iterative approach for environmental scanning is replaced by a more straightforward process. Early testing of the conceptual model has shown results of increased quality and speed of decision-making. Further testing and feedback is still required to enhance and calibrate the AI-functionality. Applied in business environments, the approach can contribute to remediate fuzziness in early front-end activities, thus helping direct innovation managers to ‚Äúdo the right things‚Äù.",60106415,"FHS St.Gallen, Hochschule f√ºr Angewandte Wissenschaften",St Gallen,Switzerland,['1706'],16.642857142857142,0.14954212454212457,0.4328754578754578,0

We test these research questions using data from 644 technological gadget projects posted on a popular crowdfunding website over two years. We further investigate our hypotheses using three laboratory studies where we replicate the above effects on backing intention of backers. Results suggest that positive framing does not have a direct effect on funding level, but on the other hand, negative framing does have a positive effect on funding level. Moreover, results indicate that public update positively affects funding level and increases the positive effect of negative framing on funding level. Results also show that the combination of positive framing and public update has a negative impact on funding level.

742,742,Extraction-Based Text Summarization and Sentiment Analysis of Online Reviews Using Hybrid Classification Method,"The field of sentiment mining and text summarization has evoked the interest of many scientists and researchers over the last few years, as the textual data has become useful for many real-world applications and challenges. Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining is the most popular field for analyzing and discovering insights from text data from various sources, such as Facebook, Twitter and Amazon, Zomato, etc. It involves a computational study of an individual's behavior in terms of buying interest and then extracting his opinions on the business entity of the company. This entity can be viewed as an event, individual, blog post or product experience. Scholars in the fields of natural language processing, data mining, machine learning and others have tested a variety of methods for automating sentiment analysis. These reviews are increasing on a daily basis, as a result of which the summarization of the reviews plays a role where the text is summarized as needed, which provides useful information from a large number of reviews. It is very difficult for a human being to extract and interpret useful data from a very large file. In the text analysis, the value of sentences is decided on the basis of the linguistic characteristics of sentences. This paper provides a comprehensive review of current and past work on sentiment analysis and text description. In this research work, a new hybrid classification system is proposed based on coupling classification methods using arcing classifiers and their quality is evaluated within terms of accuracy. The Classifier Collection was constructed using Na√Øve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The proposed work consists of a comparative study of the efficacy of the ensemble technique for sentiment classification.

The proposed method used VGG-16 networks to extract feature maps in the convolution layer and tracked the objects through candidate region estimation. We used convolution layers containing semantic information and convolution layers containing detailed information. In order to use the information on the two layers together, the network structures proceeded with parallel. After extracting the feature map, the number of candidate bounding boxes was added and the candidate bounding box was used to generate the final bounding box. Conventional SSD may fail to detect objects that have a single structure and contain a small amount of information on the feature map. The proposed method used feature maps that contained more information to improve the object tracking rate.

As organizations become increasingly reliant upon the contemporary Information and Communication Technologies, they also expose themselves to a vast pool of threats and vulnerabilities. The purpose of this paper is to bring focus on the detection and prevention of Distributed Denial of Service attacks with respect to Small and Medium Enterprises. The paper adopts a case study approach, and aims at designing a technology solution that could help CloudPlus in promptly detecting and preventing DDoS attacks. The technology solution comprises of three layers, including cloud signaling, firewalling and third-party cloud security through Akamai. The solution has been designed such that it can be replicated by any SME that is cloud-based.

757,757,A comparison of two hybrid methods for analyzing evidential reasoning,"Reasoning with evidence is error prone, especially when qualitative and quantitative evidence is combined, as shown by infamous miscarriages of justice, such as the Lucia de Berk case in the Netherlands. Methods for the rational analysis of evidential reasoning come in different kinds, often with arguments, scenarios and probabilities as primitives. Recently various combinations of argumentative, narrative and probabilistic methods have been investigated. By the complexity and subtlety of the subject matter, it has proven hard to assess the specific strengths and points of attention of different methods. Comparative case studies have only recently started, and never by one team. In this paper, we provide an analysis of a single case in order to compare the relative merits of two methods recently proposed in AI and Law: a method using Bayesian networks with embedded scenarios, and a method using case models that provide a formal analysis of argument validity. To optimise the transparency of the two analyses, we have selected a case about which the final decision is undisputed. The two analyses allow us to provide a comparative evaluation showing strengths and weaknesses of the two methods. We find a core of evidential reasoning that is shared between the methods.",60010023,University of Groningen,Groningen,Netherlands,['1702'],22.22222222222222,-0.06865079365079364,0.5276190476190477,1
758,758,Towards Understanding the Role of Product Usage Information in Product Design Improvement,"A critical factor that makes a product successful is its acceptance in its market. To achieve this goal, producers oftentimes collect and analyze feedback information from the market. This information allows them to get a deeper understanding about the product behaviors, customers, their usage patterns, future needs and expectations. The academic literature describes a variety of use cases that outline how development-related tasks can benefit from Product Usage Information (PUI). They differ, for instance, in the investigated product, task, communication channel, information source, and the type of the result. This diversity and the lack of a generally agreed vocabulary in this research domain facilitates a fragmentation of PUI-related research. This paper provides a first systematic overview of a selection of PUI application cases in product design improvement. The study sample consists of 17 research papers from the last 20 years. We characterize and classify the papers mainly through three dimensions: product type, product development phase, and information sources and channels. The results indicate that PUI can support different tasks during product improvement, both in the task clarification phase and in the product conceptual, embodiment and detailed design phases. Our findings suggest that organizations need to know more about PUI-related information sources and channels.",60008293,University of Bremen,Bremen,Germany,"['1710', '1705']",18.454545454545453,0.19242424242424241,0.4507575757575758,1

761,761,An Approach to Assess Engineering Change Effort Retrospectively Utilizing Past Engineering Change Information,"The competitiveness of companies is nowadays highly dependent on an efficient product development. Shorter time to market, increased competition as well as accelerated market dynamics can be handled well by a continuous improvement in development efficiency. Hence, improving the development performance can have a big impact on the time to market. However, an increasing number of resources must be assigned to the management of engineering changes. The management of changes strongly influences the resources available for the actual design process. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of technical systems as well as the organization affects the engineering change situation and further induces change complexity. This paper therefore introduces an approach to retrospectively assess engineering change information to identify areas for reducing the change workload. It therefore introduces a procedure to guide users through the process of the assessment. In addition, it suggests indicators to evaluate the change situation regarding the induced workload. Finally, the approach is applied in a use case to investigate an engineering change data set.",60107405,Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1710', '1705']",16.6,0.12416666666666666,0.43416666666666665,1

767,767,A Novel Approach to Product Lifecycle Management and Engineering Using Behavioural Models for the Conceptual Design Phase,"This work builds upon a previous proposal for the use of the extended SAPPhIRE model of causality as a foundation for a PLM system, and more specifically the management of design data at the conceptual design phase. During the conceptual design phase, the product definition is in a state of flux as multiple iterations and options are considered until a suitable baseline design is developed. The role of PLM systems is to manage the people, processes and products involved in developing and sustaining a product in order to increase stakeholder satisfaction and product quality while reducing lifecycle costs. At the conceptual design stage, a balance must be struck between the freedom to iterate and the need to control the design process and capture relevant data. Currently, PLM systems are not well suited for the support of the conceptual design stage due to their reliance on the product structure, as the unavoidable, significant design changes to the physical configuration in the early design stages make it difficult to maintain a coherent product definition. This paper presents a case study of the product data created during the conceptual design phase of the SpudNik-1 CubeSat. The results demonstrate the ability of the model to represent a variety of design data representing different subsystems at several levels of maturity. This could prove to be more consistent and easier to use for conceptual design and is one part of a larger goal of redesigning PLM systems for the support of the extended product lifecycle.",60007655,University of Prince Edward Island,Charlottetown,Canada,"['1710', '1705']",31.125,0.13796296296296295,0.45886243386243386,1

We will demonstrate the effectiveness of sparsity as a prior for regularizing the otherwise ill-posed super-resolution problem.

773,773,Neural network models for assessing the financial condition of enterprises for supply chain,"The paper deals with the task of assessing the financial condition of enterprises. To solve it, we prove the necessity of building a neural network model for supply chain. A set of financial ratios is defined as the input parameters of the model: the current liquidity ratio of the enterprise, the equity ratio, the equity turnover ratio, and the return on equity ratio. The output parameters were the types of the financial condition of enterprises: an unstable state (regression), a normal state (stable) and an absolutely stable state (progression). The volume of input data for building neural network models for assessing the financial condition of enterprises amounted to 210 records. The construction and evaluation of the effectiveness of neural network models are based on the analytical platform Deductor. There have been built 32 modifications of neural network models with different architectures and trained with different samples formed randomly from the source data. To assess the effectiveness of the models built, a technique has been developed, which includes the stages of testing neural networks, evaluating their accuracy and average classification error taking into account weighting factors assigned by an expert. The results of calculations of errors of the first and second type for each financial condition, as well as the average total classification error, are presented. The best model with a minimum average classification error, which is a single-layer perceptron with 10 hidden neurons, was chosen. The classification accuracy of the model was about 98%. The neural network model is adequate and can be effectively used to solve the problem of assessing the financial condition of enterprises.",60088527,Kazan National Research Technical University named after A.

774,774,"Keep calm and code on your phone: A pilot of suacode, an online smartphone-based coding course","Africa lags behind the rest of the world in terms of digital literacy skills with less than one percent of African children leaving school with basic coding skills. One cause of this gap is poor access to equipment such as computers for teaching and learning. Yet, there is a proliferation of smartphones in Africa. Seeking to leverage this opportunity, we developed SuaCode, an online smartphone-based coding course to teach programming fundamentals to Africans. We designed the course to teach coding in a visual, interactive and fun way through the building of a pong game using Processing (a Java-based programming language). In this work, we describe our experience delivering the course online to 30 Ghanaian high school and college students. At the end of the course, 7 of the 30 students completed the first part of the course, building the pong game. The reflection essays from our students showed that they enjoyed the course and coding on a smartphone was not a barrier to completing the assignments. Improvements such as having more mentors and automated feedback on the coding assignments will improve the quality of the course. Given the difficulty in accessing computers in Africa, our work shows that smartphones can be leveraged to effectively introduce students to programming concepts via an online course.

In practice, however, educators often do not know specifically which tasks their students perform and which technologies they use, mainly due to the distance between coach and student during the work placement and the lack of cohort-based overviews of activities performed in internships. In this study, we gathered and analyzed workplace activity data of 54 students over the course of their third-year semester-long internships in the computing industry. We performed descriptive analyses to gain insight into i) which categories of activities students performed most (programming, research and documentation) and ii) which of the activity categories they find most difficult (research, documentation (both academic and IT) and implementation/configuration). Subsequent text analysis gives us insight into students' perceptions of the categories used to label activities (testing, research, meetings, and academic documentation are congruous) and which technologies were used most by these students. Based on the results, we conclude it is feasible to use user-generated data to get insights into workplace activities of computing interns.

In order to evaluate city attractiveness for business in Russia the authors collected a database consisting of a set of indicators over a period of five years (2013-2017). A comprehensive and detailed evaluation of each of the indicators made it possible to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each selected city and compare the data obtained by translating the values into indices. It allows us not to focus on the study of each city in isolation, but to compare them with each other, to reveal competitive advantages. Based on the integral index of business attractiveness, the following groups of Russian cities are distinguished: cities leading for business attractiveness (Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk, Kazan), cities middling for business attractiveness (Ufa, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Perm, Novosibirsk, Samara, Chelyabinsk), cities-outsiders for business attractiveness (Voronezh, Volgograd, Omsk).",60070941,Kazan Federal University,Kazan,Russian Federation,['1710'],25.77777777777778,0.30294486215538846,0.562468671679198,1

Layer One establishes decentralized trust roots using decentralized identifiers (DIDs), an emerging W3C standard for decentralized PKI. Layer Two is the DIDComm protocol, a transport-independent protocol that uses DIDs to form and communicate over a cryptographically secure connection. Layer Three is a suite of credential exchange protocols based on the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard for cryptographically verifiable digital credentials. Layer Four adds cryptographically verifiable governance frameworks using a metamodel for describing the business, legal, and technical policies under which a peer is operating as an issuer, holder, or verifier of digital credentials. This governance metamodel can be applied at all four Layers of the stack, producing a parallel ToIP Governance Stack that fully integrates the non-technical dimensions of trust establishment.

793,793,Estimation of Prospective States of Mechanical Parts for Lifecycle Support by Part Agents,"This paper discusses the lifecycle simulation of mechanical parts that are managed by part agents to promote their effective reuse. It is essential to promote the reuse of mechanical parts with lifecycle management for the realization of a sustainable society. However, it is difficult to manage products in the use phase of product lifecycles owing to the unpredictable and uncontrollable behavior of consumers. This paper proposes a product lifecycle management system, called part agent system, using network agents and RFID tags attached on parts to promote reuse. A part agent generates advice for the user regarding the maintenance of corresponding parts based on its current state and lifecycle information. The lifecycle simulation scheme performed by part agents is described herein. First, a part agent expands the part lifecycle with time. Next, it estimates by simulating the deterioration of the part and subsequently selects preferable maintenance actions. To simulate forthcoming states of the part, the possibility of events related to the part is estimated based on the causal relation of events with the acquired data on the states of the part, user operations, and detected events. Herein, a proposed method is presented to describe how the deterioration process is represented as causal relations with probabilities and how the relation is created using simulation. The simulation method is described for two example cases: fatigue of spring and deterioration of joints of a robotic manipulator.",60015336,Chuo University,Hachioji,Japan,"['1710', '1705']",21.09090909090909,0.008333333333333331,0.44833333333333336,1

On the way to Industry 4.0 robots have to be automated and perform operation in coalition to reach common goals. The paper describes an approach to dynamic formation of coalitions of autonomous robots based on the integration of fuzzy cooperative games and smart contracts. Each robot is viewed as an agent, negotiating and bidding with others during the coalition forming for distribution of joint winnings. It is necessary to find combination of robots in way to maximize efficiency of joint work, while the efficiency of the entire coalition is unknown beforehand. A cooperative game with fuzzy core is used to form a coalition of robots allowing coordinating the actions of individual members to achieve a common goal, as well as to evaluate and distribute the overall benefit. To implement the negotiation process and record the composition of the coalition and the responsibilities of individual participants, it is proposed to use the smart contract technology, which now become a part of the blockchain technology. Smart contracts are proposed to be used as entity holding requirements and expected winnings of each participant in the immutable structure of a blockchain network. The final agreement can also be stored by all participants in form of smart contract that contains the distribution coefficients of the winnings given all the conditions of participation in the coalition. The availability of smart contracts to all participants in the coalition makes it possible to ensure joint control over the fulfillment of the task assigned to the coalition.",60101977,St. Petersburg Institute for Informatics and Automation of the Russian Academy of Sciences,Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,"['1710', '1705']",25.7,0.03673469387755103,0.5499433106575964,1

The main starting mechanisms and types of DDoS attacks are analyzed. To identify them, signature and behavioral methods of analyzing network traffic are used. Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of these methods actualized the need for their combined use. To detect and classify DDoS attacks, the need to develop and use a neural network model has been updated. The training and testing of the model were made on the initial data from the NSL-KDD set. All lines in this set are represented as sequences of TCP packets, UDP packets, and ICMP packets of network traffic transmitted from the source of the attack to the attacked network node. The total sample size was 8067 lines. Of these, half of the data corresponded to DDoS attacks, and the rest of the data characterized clear connections. The Deductor modelling environment was used to build the neural network model. The constructed neural network model was a single-layer perceptron with 11 input neurons, 23 hidden neurons and 1 output neuron. The accuracy of the constructed model was calculated based on contingency tables. The accuracy of the initial data classification at the training stage was 97.94%. The classification accuracy at the testing stage was 97.87%. To assess the quality of the neural network model, the errors of the first (0.93%) and second (3.3%) type are calculated.

Data acquired in the physical domain are incorporated into a cyber-space to assist in predictive and decision-making processes. The acquisition of data in the physical domain involves the measurement of physical magnitudes. The digital as-built or as-manufactured model derives from measured or scanned data of a physical product. Thus, it is relevant to know how much the data are true. The uncertainty of a measured magnitude is a significant indicator of the data truthfulness. This work shows how the uncertainty is being modeled in standards related to product data representation and in an engineering data fusion context.

Automated planning methods are employed to facilitate IES development at the design and requirement analysis stages. General problems of developing a modern software tool base for IES design are discussed. In this context, the intelligent software environment of the AT-TECHNOLOGY workbench for IES development based on the problem-oriented methodology is described. The problem of planning the IES prototyping process is investigated, which forms the basis for implementing the basic components of the intelligent software environment (intelligent planner and technological knowledge base). An automation method based on heuristic search is proposed. The use of the intelligent software environment is illustrated by the development of a dynamic IES prototype for controlling and planning medical resources in serious road traffic accidents.",60068673,National Research Nuclear University MEPhI,Moscow,Russian Federation,['1700'],21.285714285714285,0.1739583333333333,0.6026041666666666,1
817,817,Integration Between PLM and MES for One-of-a-Kind Production,"Despite the amount of research addressing the formalization of product-related knowledge, the practical use of tools for knowledge management is still very low at the corporate level. Several commercial software applications are already available for product lifecycle management (PLM) and manufacturing execution system (MES). Unfortunately, these two applications are scarcely integrated thus preventing an efficient and pervasive collection of data and the consequent creation of useful information. This is more critical in One-of-a-kind Production (OKP), where each product is unique, the process is not completely defined at the design stage, but it is continuously improved at the shop floor level by skilled operator. In such situations, most of the company‚Äôs knowledge relies on the lessons learnt by operators in years of work experience, and their ability to reuse this knowledge in order to face new problems. Because OKP must develop unique product and complex processes in a short time, it is mandatory to reuse the acquired information in the most efficient way. It is therefore necessary to collect all the data from the shop floor and transform them in information that will be used in the development of the next product and process. The aim of this paper is to design a framework able to integrate data, from both design and manufacturing phases. To this aim, a framework has been designed to structure and relate information from the PLM and the MES systems.

In particular, metropolitan city roads are being flooded with traffic each day and the numbers only seem to increase. While government bodies are busy in constructing numerous flyovers and underpasses to cope with the increasing traffic load, the current paper proposes an initiative to assist the government in better management of traffic through application of technology. As such, the paper proposes a unique traffic management system capitalizing over the Internet of Things. The system would work by virtue of a circuit board that is installed across the traffic signals and on the vehicles, allowing them to interact with traffic signals, change the light to red by detecting traffic overload on the opposite side of the road, respond to changing traffic lights and promptly identify vacant parking space for drivers.

We have been empirically pursuing what a valuable facilitation for the workshop is; how multi-party PLM stakeholders can build proactively a mutual consensus in as short a time as possible. PLM project promotion members always encounter a difficulty of consensus building. This is because various stockholders have different opinions and responsibilities through sales, engineering, manufacturing, and service departments. Firstly, we mention key challenges of multi-party consensus building in PLM strategy planning phase. Secondly, we propose a programmatic framework on intensive workshop-facilitation which is configured twelve steps. The key outcome of the workshop is to craft a PLM Success Value Roadmap (PSVR) which is contained various hypothesis defined by the workshop participants helping by facilitators (KPIs). For example, there are PLM vision, strategy, initiative, process, and key performance indicator. Thirdly, we mention an empirical case study conducted our proposed workshop-facilitation method for an industrial company. Seventeen stakeholders were joined as the workshop participants who were invited from three different business units. It was held as a two-day intensive PLM trial workshop. Finally, we found that the proposed workshop-facilitation as a consensus building method contributed to the satisfaction of more than 60% of the participants. 85% of the participants commented that they would encourage colleagues to participate in the workshop that we have developed.

830,830,ERST: Leveraging topic features for context-aware legal reference linking,"As legal regulations evolve, companies and organizations are tasked with quickly understanding and adapting to regulation changes. Tools like legal knowledge bases can facilitate this process, by either helping users navigate legal information or become aware of potentially relevant updates. At their core, these tools require legal references from many sources to be unified, e.g., by legal entity linking. This is challenging since legal references are often implicitly expressed, or combined via a context. In this paper, we prototype a machine learning approach to link legal references and retrieve combinations for a given context, based on standard features and classifiers, as used in entity resolution. As an extension, we evaluate an enhancement of those features with topic vectors, aiming to capture the relevant context of the passage containing a reference.

834,834,An Approach to Semantic Interoperability for Product Development Through Automatic Requirement Extraction and Semantic Reconciliation,"The strong competitiveness challenges manufacturing industry to rationalize different ways of bringing new products to the market in the shortest time with competitive prices while ensuring higher quality. Industries need to effectively share product requirements, which comes from various sources and are heterogeneous in nature, during the Product Development Process (PDP) to stay competitive. However, problems with misinterpretation of such requirements have been identified during its sharing due to semantic interoperability obstacles related to the process of automatically gathering requirements and their translation and reuse. This research proposes an approach to automatically gather product requirements, extracting its knowledge and translate it for further use and reuse along PDP. The research structure consisted of firstly studying the current issues of the topic, secondly by exploring an approach, to be validated in an experimental case. Current issues point out to gaps related to the process of semantic reconciliation and knowledge extraction perspectives, giving it a multi-dimensional panorama where semantic issues are intertwined among different perspectives. The later solution presents an approach which considers raw information being processed into product features, refining knowledge during PDP and making it reusable in different cycles. The approach brings a new view on practical methods for automatically collect product requirements, extract its knowledge and translate it into product features, based on knowledge extraction methods and by using semantic reconciliation as means for translating product‚Äôs requirements.

Rhetorical status classification (RSC) is the task of classifying sentences according to the rhetorical functions they fulfil; it is an important preprocessing step for our overall goal of legal summarisation. We present several improvements over our previous RSC classifier, which was based on CRF. The first is a BiLSTM-CRF based model which improves performance significantly over previous baselines. The BiLSTM-CRF architecture is able to additionally take the context in terms of neighbouring sentences into account. The second improvement is the inclusion of section heading information, which resulted in the overall best classifier. Explicit structure in the text, such as headings, is an information source which is likely to be important to legal professionals during the reading phase; this makes the automatic exploitation of such information attractive.

844,844,Is deductive program verification mature enough to be taught to software engineers?,"Software engineers working in industry seldom try to apply formal methods to solve problems. There are various reasons for this. Sometimes these reasons are understandable-the cost of using formal methods does not make economic sense in many contexts. However, formal methods are also often greeted with scepticism. Formal methods are assumed to take too much time, require tools that are too academic, or to be too mathematical to be understood by practice-oriented software engineers. We tested these assumptions by designing a small course around a framework for program verification, aimed at regular computer science students enrolled in a Master's programme. After four lectures and associated exercises, students were given a small verification task where they had to model and verify a real, non-trivial, C function in Why3. A significant majority of students managed to prove a non-trivial functional specification of this C function in the time allotted, and many also pointed out inherent flaws of this function discovered during formalization. Participants reported no major difficulties or mental hurdles in learning Why3, and considered its approach to be appropriate for selected components of safety-critical software. While formal verification tools such as Why3 still have lots of room for improvement, this experience shows that in a short amount of time, software engineers can be taught to use a program verification tool, and obtain usable results without being fully proficient in it. We further recommend that courses on formal methods should also let students explore these as techniques to be applied, instead of only focusing on the theory behind them, as we expect this to gradually lower the barrier to wider acceptance.",60024360,Open University of the Netherlands,Heerlen,Netherlands,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.454545454545453,0.07218749999999999,0.4075961538461538,1

849,849,A Concept to Integrate Manufacturing Execution and Product Data Management Systems,"Variant rich production of individualized products and customer solutions results in new challenges for all involved industrial information systems in a producing company. To keep pace with the new requirements of a volatile future market and to exploit benefits of flexible digital production environments, it is crucial to adapt integration concepts of Industry 4.0, e.g. enhance information exchangeability by improving interconnectivity between software solutions, utilize all sources of data from a products production and use phase, and maintaining an up-to-date digital twin of the product and production assets. This paper presents an integration concept for the interaction between Product Data Management (PDM) systems, Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and shop floor level client systems. It addresses the gap of information flow between the different involved key software tools in a twofold manner. On the one hand side, specific information gained from production and use phase data of products have to be looped back to the PDM system. This sets the foundation for a better understanding of production planning and execution as well as use phase issues related to the engineering phase where problems have to be addressed for continuous product improvement. On the other hand, a direct information flow from PDM to MES and shop floor clients is defined to enable forwarding of current variant product instance information.

This study is focused on the current developments of AI within governments and it aims to provide citizens with a good motivation of (partly) automated decisions. For this study a framework to assess the quality of explanations of legal decisions by public administrations was developed.

At the first stage, a new vector criterion is formed by adding the membership function to the set of initial criteria and information about the importance of criteria in the form of quanta of information is used to reduce the Pareto set. If the reduced Pareto set is not chosen as the final solution to the multicriteria optimization problem, scalarization that uses the concept of ‚Äã‚Äãgoal programming is proposed at the second stage.",60031888,Saint Petersburg State University,Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,['1700'],22.6,0.13106060606060607,0.36464646464646466,1
854,854,Static detection of design patterns in class diagrams,"Teaching Object-Oriented design on the class diagram level is often a cumbersome effort. Requiring the use of specific design patterns helps the students in structuring their design properly. However, checking whether students used the right design pattern can be a very time-intensive task due to the variety of possibilities of creating structure using design patterns on the high-level class diagrams. For the same reason, it is hard for students to check for themselves whether their solution fulfills the basic requirements that are required by the instructor with respect to the use of design patterns. Efficiency and the quality of design pattern education can be improved by automatic detection of design patterns in UML class diagrams. We introduce a new method to detect design patterns in class diagrams, together with a prototype of a tool that uses this new method. Using this tool, an instructor needs less effort to review solutions of design exercises since the tool can check the basic class requirements automatically. Consequently, an instructor can focus on the more high-level requirements that were set in the exercise and students can easier check for themselves whether their design satisfies the basic required properties on the pattern level. The method offers static decidability for those design patterns, that are identified by structural properties e.c. the names of the classes and their associations. It is non-duplicating. That is a specific occurrence of a design pattern is not reported multiple times. The method not only detects all 16 static Gang of Four design patterns without false positives or false negatives, but also it can detect redundant relations. Our tool contributes to the quality and efficiency of design pattern education, both for students and instructors.",60102765,The Hague University of Applied Sciences,Den Haag,Netherlands,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",20.142857142857142,0.03370035761340108,0.35991906644080557,1
855,855,Verifying meaning equivalence in bilingual international treaties,"This paper examines to what extent distributional approaches to induce bilingual lexica can capture correspondences between bilingual terms in international treaties. Recent developments in bilingual distributional representation learning methods have improved bilingual textual processing performances, and the application of these methods to processing specialised texts and technical terms has increased, including in the legal domain. Here we face at least two issues. Firstly, whether technical terms follow the distributional hypothesis or not is both theoretically and practically a critical concern. Theoretically, corresponding technical terms in different languages are the labels of the same concept and thus their equivalence is independent of the textual context. From this point of view, the distributional hypothesis holds only when the terms totally bind the context. This leads to the second issue, i.e. to verify the extent to which word embedding models trained on texts with different levels of specialisation are useful in capturing cross-lingual equivalences of terms. This paper examines these issues by conducting experiments in which different models trained on the texts with different degree of specialisations are evaluated against three different sets of equivalent bilingual pairs in the legal domain, i.e. of legal terms, of sub-technical terms and of general words. The results show that models learned on large-scale general texts fall far behind models learned on specialised texts in representing equivalent bilingual terms, while the former models have better performances for sub-technical terms and general words than the latter.",60025272,University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,['1702'],21.636363636363637,0.03750000000000001,0.36197916666666663,1

858,858,Similarity and relevance of court decisions: A computational study on cJEU cases,"Identification of relevant or similar court decisions is a core activity in legal decision making for case law researchers and practitioners. With an ever increasing body of case law, a manual analysis of court decisions can become practically impossible. As a result, some decisions are inevitably overlooked. Alternatively, network analysis may be applied to detect relevant precedents and landmark cases. Previous research suggests that citation networks of court decisions frequently provide relevant precedents and landmark cases. The advent of text similarity measures (both syntactic and semantic) has meant that potentially relevant cases can be identified without the need to manually read them. However, how close do these measures come to approximating the notion of relevance captured in the citation network? In this contribution, we explore this question by measuring the level of agreement of state-of-the-art text similarity algorithms with the citation behavior in the case citation network. For this paper, we focus on judgements by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) as published in the EUR-Lex database. Our results show that similarity of the full texts of CJEU court decisions does not closely mirror citation behaviour, there is a substantial overlap. In particular, we found syntactic measures surprisingly outperform semantic ones in approximating the citation network.",60018869,Maastricht University,Maastricht,Netherlands,['1702'],20.9,0.16309523809523813,0.5750000000000001,1
859,859,DaSt: An online platform for automated exercise generation and solving in the data science domain,"Over the last few years data science has emerged both as a new research field and as an educational domain that attracted a large number of researchers and data practitioners.

The present work aims to cover the gap of educational data science tools by proposing a novel platform; the platform, coined Data Science Tutor (DaST), is a free online tool that offers automated step-by-step exercise solving in a variety of data science algorithms/techniques aiming at giving insight to the particularities of each algorithm.

The tool aims at students, lecturers, and data practitioners in many diverse fields (ranging from data analysts to transport engineers to logistics managers) that want to learn the particularities of data science algorithms in a stepwise, interactive manner. Through the proposed platform (a) students in the data science field or in related courses (e.g., machine learning, information retrieval) may get solutions for different types of exercises and focus on the details of each algorithm, (b) tutors (lecturers, lab assistants) may easily produce a wide variety of exercises with the accompanying solutions and use them in classroom or as an auxiliary tool for test correction, and (c) data practitioners may get valuable insights on popular data science algorithms.

865,865,A Preliminary Method to Support the Semantic Interoperability in Models of Manufacturing (MfM) Based on an Ontological Approach,"The product design and manufacturing complexity have been increased in the last few years. This has challenged the manufacturing industry to rationalise different ways of bringing to the market novel products in a short lead-time with competitive prices while ensuring higher quality levels and customisation. Design and Simulation systems bring to the product developer experts an abstraction required for the design of complex products. However, for a complex product manufacturing process has required simultaneously collaborations with multiple groups, producing and exchanging information from multi-perspectives within and across institutional boundaries. Thousands of different information must be exchanged across heterogeneous systems. Semantic interoperability obstacles have been identified in view of the information heterogeneity from multiple perspectives and their relationships across different phases of product manufacturing. In this context, this paper presents a preliminary method for Models for Manufacturing (MfM) to support the semantic interoperability across the manufacturing system based on reference ontologies, application ontologies and semantic rules. The MfM has been modelled in reference ontologies and specialised to perform multiple specific applications according to the product to be manufactured. Semantic rules are used to share, convert or translate information from multiple perspectives in order to infer the relation between multiple manufacturing levels. The main research contributions are: (i) the intelligence structuring information in elementary concepts responsible for representing the MfM, modelled in the core ontologies (Reference Ontologies) and (ii) the improvement of information exchanging (translation, conversion and sharing) from heterogeneous domain across different phases of manufacturing process based on the semantic rules.",60118569,AIRBUS Operations SL,Getafe,Spain,"['1710', '1705']",25.0,-0.03253968253968255,0.33690476190476193,1

868,868,Tying Ethics to Teamwork Training in a Minimodule,"Most CS and engineering curricula require that students take ethics training and acquire competence in teamwork skills before graduation. Both ethics and teamwork are course objectives mandated by the Accreditation Board for Engineering & Technology (ABET). However, ethics and teamwork are difficult to teach by regular STEM faculty. Lingard (2010) suggests that faculty may not have had much teamwork training themselves. Students can take ethics courses in other departments which may/not help the students to engage in moral reasoning or help them in considering societal implications of technologies they learn in CS or Engineering courses. Thus, there is a growing recognition of the need for a more integrative approach, such as to teach ethics across the curriculum (Pease and Baker, 2009) or embed ethics within the CS curriculum (Grosz et al, 2019). At the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), we are pilot testing a short, integrative approach, i.e., a 4-class period minimodule, covering both ethics and teamwork, embedded in CS or ECE courses. It includes a short refresher on moral reasoning, examples of cooperative behavior in animals and student-led teamwork demonstrations. Using an andragogical approach we provide questions to guide discussions by student teams after viewing video lectures by renowned experts. Outside of class, student teams prepare teamwork demonstrations for the class. We report results and observations.

To optimize the parameters of classifiers, a continuous shuffled frog-leaping algorithm is applied. On a set of constructed classifiers, the optimal classifier is selected in terms of the accuracy and the number of features used, using the statistical Akaike informational criterion. The efficiency of the proposed approach is tested on 15 KEEL data sets. The results are statistically compared with the results of similar algorithms. The new approach to designing fuzzy classifiers proposed in this article makes it possible to reduce the number of rules and attributes, thereby increasing the interpretability of classification results.",60010892,Tomsk State University of Control Systems and Radioelectronics,Tomsk,Russian Federation,['1700'],17.666666666666668,0.06818181818181818,0.5772727272727273,1
870,870,"Communication Protocol Application for Enhanced Connectivity of Sensors, Machines and Systems in Additive Manufacturing and Production Networks","The connection between sensors, systems and machines in the production environment enables new concepts to increase quality or flexibility. Integrated sensors can measure machine performance parameters. The measurements serve for monitoring of process stability and quality or for affecting production planning through a new agile routing. To realize the new concepts, data needs to be transmitted from the sensors to a data management system, where the collected data can be analyzed and stored. The communication between sensors, machines and systems is a central aspect and, therefore, a big challenge. There exist different protocols to enable communication, but choosing the proper protocol for a special use case is difficult. There does not exist a method that supports the choice of the protocol depending on the initial situation and the user‚Äôs preferences. Therefore, the aim of this paper is the development and implementation of a method that supports the selection of a communication protocol in an Industrie 4.0 surrounding for enhanced connectivity between sensors, systems and machines in the production depending on the individual initial situation and the personal preferences. After a short motivation and state of the art, two use cases are described and the development of the concept is explained.

871,871,Evaluation of a structured design methodology for concurrent programming,"Learning how to design and implement a program is hard. Teaching methods and textbooks on Java programming often treat a new subject in terms of syntax and examples. Little attention is paid to systematically designing programs with these new concepts. Research has shown that such a complex task requires not only conceptual knowledge, but also explicit procedural support. In this paper, we investigate the effect of combining conceptual and procedural guidance to teaching and learning concurrent programming. We build on earlier research in which we have introduced such a structured design methodology which divides the development of multi-threaded Java programs into a sequence of explicit, manageable steps: The Steps Plan. We present our experiences with applying the Steps Plan in an introductory course on object-oriented programming, with multithreading. The main questions addressed are: ""What problems did the students encounter in direct relation to the Steps Plan?"", and ""What general problems surfaced?"" As to the first question, two important issues were that using a relatively far developed sequential solution as a stepping stone towards a multi-threaded solution wrong-footed some students, and that remedying race condition situations turned out to be supported at a too high level of abstraction. As to the second question, two notable issues were that deciding on the right amount and type of concurrency by themselves is maybe too difficult for students at this level, and that the notion of (establishing) correctness or quality of a solution is, different from the sequential case, not intuitively clear to students. For these issues, the paper recommends remedies and indicates directions for future work. We discuss the consequences for education as regards teaching materials and forms of teaching.",60032882,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Eindhoven,Netherlands,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",25.181818181818183,0.03997211122211123,0.4898001998001998,1

However, investing in this kind of technologies could be not enough to go through this transformation in an effective way: manufacturers need to realize which is their actual digital status and at the same time to evaluate how they support their product development process. In addition, it has not to be neglected the importance of how the process of product development is organized and managed throughout the several functions involved. So far, different methods and maturity models have been proposed in literature to help practitioners to evaluate the readiness and maturity of either their smart level or their design and engineering process.

The pagination process requires all documents to be analysed by an expert and sorted accordingly. This is a time consuming and expensive task. Automated pagination is complicated by the fact that the constituent documents can contain both typed and handwritten texts. A successful auto-pagination system must recognise the different text types, and treat them accordingly. In this paper we compare methods for determining the type of text data contained within paginated bundle pages. Specifically, we classify pages as containing typed data only, handwritten data only, or a mixture of the two. For this purpose, we compare text classification methods, image classification methods, and ensemble methods using both textual and visual information. We find the text and image based approaches provide complimentary information, and that combining the two produces a powerful document classifier.",60020661,University of Liverpool,Liverpool,United Kingdom,['1702'],16.77777777777778,0.08636363636363638,0.7136363636363636,1

Specifically, during the software design stage, abstraction allows in a software architecture decrease the complexity and achieve a more efficient decomposition. However, despite its importance and difficulty, there is a lack of theoretical or empirical research that explores how to enhance such ability. In this paper, we report the results of a research that was undertaken in order to address this gap in the body of knowledge. Particularly, we conducted a qualitative study through a thematic analysis to explore how students apply abstraction during the object-oriented software design.

To solve it, the need to use fuzzy-production knowledge bases and fuzzy inference algorithms as part of fuzzy decision support systems is being updated. As a tool for constructing a knowledge base, a neural-fuzzy model is proposed. The proposed type of fuzzy-production rules and the logic inference algorithm on rules for objects state assessing are described. A structure of a fuzzy neural network, consisting of six layers, each of which implements the corresponding stage of the logic inference algorithm, is proposed. As a result of training a fuzzy neural network, a system of fuzzyproduction rules is formed, which make up the knowledge base of the decision support system for objects state assessing. On the basis of the proposed neuro-fuzzy model, a software package has been implemented for automating the processes of forming fuzzy-production rules. The main components of the software package are the knowledge base generation module and the fuzzy inference module. As an approbation of the neuro-fuzzy model, the formation of fuzzy rules for assessing the state of water lines at the cluster pumping stations in reservoir pressure maintenance systems has been carried out.

891,891,The Integration of True Lean and Industry 4.0 to Sustain a Culture of Continuous Improvement,"Recent advances in information and communication technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) are driving the development of Industry 4.0. Its objective is to enable real-time information exchange between people, machines, products and resources, providing new opportunities for improved safety, quality, productivity and cost factors which can be applied in all stages of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). The application of lean principles and practices where Industry 4.0 is deployed can leverage real-time processing visibility into even greater productivity improvements if implemented correctly. To do this, companies need to go beyond the implementation of the familiar lean tools and practices such as 5S, visual management and management directed kaizen activities etc. to consider the thinking behind the tools, especially the role of the team members.

896,896,Software development for cutting tool routing problems," Published by Elsevier B.V.Lots of studies on tool paths for cutting machines mainly deal with contour by contour cutting. While constructing a path one needs to determine the pierce point and the direction of contour passing. In this case only the length of idle passes may be optimized. To solve this problem generalized travelling salesman problem (GTSP) approach is used. Resource-efficient technologies for cutting sheet materials allow for the contours of cut-off details to be overlapped. It allows reducing the material waste and shortening the length of cuts. Common cuts are also the origin of one more set of precedence constraints. These constraints can be formalized as one general formal restriction called as Ordered Enclosing (OE) for plane graphs that are the homeomorphic images of the cutting plan. In this report we consider the common case of a cutting problem when combination of contours is allowed. We review the polynomial algorithms for all the possible restrictions: (1) part cut off a sheet does not require further cuts (constructing of OE-route); (2) there are no intersections of cuts (constructing of NOE-route); (3) there are some restrictions on placement of pierce points (constructing of PPOE-cover). Our paper considers software that, according to the cutting plan, allows to get a homeomorphic image of the graph to solve the routing problem, solves this problem and interprets the results of the solution.",60008009,South Ural State University,Chelyabinsk,Russian Federation,['1702'],20.727272727272727,-0.2770833333333333,0.7020833333333334,0

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)Adhesively-bonded joints have become more efficient due to the improvement of adhesives' characteristics. On the other hand, with the use of composites in structures it is possible to reduce weight. Due to this, new techniques are being explored, including adhesively-bonding different materials. Nowadays, in many high performance structures, it is necessary to combine composite materials with other light-weighted metals such as aluminium or titanium. This work reports on an experimental and numerical study for hybrid scarf joints between composite and aluminium adherends, and considering different values of the scarf angle (a). The numerical analysis by Finite Elements (FE), using the software Abaqus¬Æ, enabled the obtainment of peel (sy) and shear stresses (txy), which are then used to discuss the strength between different joint configurations. Cohesive zone modelling (CZM) was used to predict the joint strength and the results were compared to the experiments for validation. The joints' behaviour was highly dependent on a, and CZM were validated for the design process of hybrid scarf joints.",60013981,Institute of Science and Innovation in Mechanical and Industrial,Porto,Portugal,['1702'],20.11111111111111,0.06213903743315508,0.5432085561497326,0

The project comprised an equestrian statue of the Duke positioned on two monolithic columns with a pedestal, capitals and trabeated system. The project was never completed except for the 10 m monolithic column, upon which statues of Pope Alexander VII (1675), Napoleon (1810) and, finally, Ludovico Ariosto (1833), the symbolic Ferrarese poet were placed. The project involves the removal of recent interventions which were structurally and aesthetically invasive: lowering the statue using a specially designed engineering technique; disassembling the 11 st components of the capital due to oxidisation of the metal connectors; replacing the oxidised parts with new connectors; controlled cleaning of the surfaces; integration with mortars made on-site with natural and sustainable materials.

899,899,Seismic and non-seismic analyses to preserve a cultural heritage Masonry building,"Romanian earthquakes in 1940 and 1977 produced severe damage to a significant number of buildings whose plans were characterized predominantly by irregularities like flexible diaphragms, structural discontinuities or L and H shapes, among others. These conceptual characteristics contributed in a decisive way to the damage or collapse of buildings designed and built according to the old seismic codes. On the other hand, European and international experience of previous strong earthquakes during the last decade shows that, in many urban areas, besides many old building, there is a number of modern RC buildings that do not meet the requirements of additionally improved codes for seismic-resistant design. The paper studies the behaviour of a masonry building under seismic and non-seismic actions, giving a practical and applicable interpretation of the dynamic amplification concept at the upper part of masonry buildings. Dynamic amplification effects, the types of damage and the variation of the structural rigidity after the consolidation works (compared to the initial situation), were evaluated. With respect to the instrumentation of micro-vibrations, the results obtained from the processing of the recorded micro-seismic data from 2019 emphasize the changes of the natural oscillation periods characteristic of the two directions, after applying the consolidation solution. This indicates an increase in rigidity obtained by reinforcing the building and, at the same time, it can be appreciated that the structural transfer of efforts has been made from the old structure to the new structural system. The work concludes that, in order to obtain correct information regarding the behavior of a structural system (due to the lack of data needed to create a reliable model), the contribution of each presented method is consistent, using the advantages of non-destructive methods and ambient/micro-seismic vibration monitoring.",60003012,Universitatea Tehnica de Constructii Bucuresti,Bucharest,Romania,['1706'],35.625,0.10045454545454545,0.2648484848484849,1

However, in these studies, the researchers did not comprehensively consider network protocols, cooperative control mechanisms and application scenarios to design the system globally, so the results have serious limitation. In this paper, we take the typical application scenario, battlefield, as the background environment, we selected appropriate network protocols and cooperative control mechanisms based on scene analysis. Further, we build the communication delay model based on the cooperative control mechanisms and network protocols, and then, we design delay robust mechanism based on the delay model. Finally, we propose the two-hop cooperative control mechanisms oriented to the constraints of application scenario and network model, and we complete the stability analysis.

The study integrates articles posted on the Web of Science database. In the first part of this study, all English language articles scripted between 2000 and 2018 and in the second part, articles listed under architecture category have been examined. Articles were analyzed based on their publication year, journals, categories, keywords and method and obtained data were analyzed via content-analysis method. Research findings manifest that VA is interlinked with a wide array of disciplines ranging from architecture-engineering sciences to art, archeology and geography. Once all of these categories are examined, it can be argued that, in general, local architecture is analyzed by associating it with environmental issues and building-physics subjects. Researchers claim that analyzing local production techniques and, based on these techniques, developing local, effective strategies is a salient research method. In the architecture category, the most widely-analyzed scale was detected as region scale; the most discussed location was Iran in the global scope. One of the featured titles in these studies is on the subject of thermal comfort. Another common subject in these articles is detected to be sustainability and matters related to sustainability. Aside from the subjects and concepts examined in these studies, another issue is the motives with which analyzed subjects were associated.

Span, spacing, and scantlings of members were recorded previous to the loss of the trusses due to a catastrophic fire in 1823. Wood species type can be inferred from comments by Pliny the Elder regarding other long-span trusses in ancient Rome. While the quality of the wood cannot be determined, the analysis results can be bracketed using allowable stresses from different wood visual grading standards. Dead and live loads can be estimated using loadings developed for current engineering practice. Quantifying the levels of stresses in the trusses of San Paolo FLM indicates a relatively conservative design. Stresses in the rafters, or upper chords, were reduced by the insertion of a collar strut providing an intermediate support to the upper chords. Even if it is assumed that timbers matching visual grade DF/L No. 2 were used, the combined flexural and axial stresses in the upper chords are well within those permitted by modern design standards.",60029653,Kent State University,Kent,United States,['1706'],20.11111111111111,-0.011268939393939397,0.21354166666666663,1

However, information on the mechanical properties of units, mortars and masonry assemblages are still lacking especially with reference to one of the most popular UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Italy, the Pompeii archaeological site. Thus, the paper focuses on the mechanical characterization of original rock specimens collected within the new archaeological excavation work area in Regio V of the Pompeii site.

The buildings, Keweerimidde House (1890s), Basiima House (1902), Chwa Building (1904), and Muteesa I Dormitory (1904), were built during an extraordinarily tumultuous period in the history of the Kingdom which no doubt had an impact on the buildings that were constructed, and their subsequent use over the years. The exploration is undertaken through an approach that combines two exploratory techniques: values and narratives. These are used to investigate the many tales that surround these buildings, while reflecting on the socio-political developments of the period, which also influenced their commissioning and construction. This led to a better understanding of the embedded relationship between the specific buildings and the stories that are often neglected in discourse of heritage in the context of Uganda. A key part of the study was the documentation of the four buildings, which revealed a further dimension of heritage studies, such as cultural changes in Buganda during the period under question.

However, the increasing complexity of this approach can lead to the weakening of other important aims such as heritage protection or addressing social vulnerability. Accordingly, the objective of the paper is to analyse the evolution of current refurbishment strategies and their effects on socio-economic inequality and built-heritage conservation in order to identify deficiencies and stablish criteria to address them and improve existing public refurbishment programmes.

909,909,"Using fiber-optic sensors and 3D photogrammetric reconstruction for crack pattern monitoring of masonry structures at the Aurelian Walls in Rome, Italy","This paper shows an application of the photogrammetric 3D reconstruction by SfM (Structure from Motion) technique and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors to evaluate the long-term crack propagation and the damage evolution on the Aurelian Walls in Rome. Aurelian Walls were built between 270 and 275 A.C. by the Emperor Aureliano to defend Rome, the capital of the Empire, from barbaric attacks. Originally, they extended for about 19 km, nowadays remains are 12.5 km long and among the longest and best-preserved ancient wall murals in the world. The two adopted techniques offer complementary advantages. By the SfM reconstruction it is possible to acquire the geometry of the studied masonry structure and to detect most relevant cracks where FBG sensors can be installed for permanent monitoring. Moreover, SfM allows to acquire the crack pattern over extended surfaces and to compare its evolution with scheduled repeated measurements. FBG sensors allow continuous monitoring at selected critical locations and offer reference data for correlation of scheduled photogrammetry measurements. 3D Photogrammetric reconstruction by SfM took advantage of hardware and software capabilities of the HPC (High Performance Computing) resources available in ENEA, which are provided by the CRESCO (Research Computational Centre on Complex Systems) infrastructure.

The paper also describes the phases of an integrated approach to obtain accurate structure condition according to visible cracks and its seismic resistance capacity, with possible strengthening techniques. The Dubrovnik Cathedral is a masonry baroque church built in the period from 1671 to 1713. It was built in the same place where the 12th century Romanesque Cathedral had collapsed in the catastrophic earthquake of 1667. The present Cathedral is a monumental three-nave basilica with a dome over the crossing. In its lifetime the Baroque Cathedral did not show any vulnerabilities until 1979, when it was hit by another earthquake, in which the Cathedral structure was slightly damaged. After the 1979 earthquake the Cathedral was retrofitted from 1981 to 1986 with the aim of increasing the structure capacity under seismic loading. Soon after the retrofitting, cracks on the main columns of the Cathedral started to appear at its base. This was the reason a structural assessment of the Dubrovnik Cathedral was conducted. The activities for the assessment involved historical research based on the analysis of written documents and historical maps, with a focus on the previous major structural changes over the centuries. Visual inspections were undertaken to identify the location and extent of cracks and construction techniques. The assessment also included a geometrical survey of the Cathedral, which was used to develop a three-dimensional finite element model. The numerical simulations led to determining the damage distribution and to identifying the most vulnerable elements. It was used for a comparison between the numerical results and the damage survey. All this led to the conclusion and to identifying the reason for the crack occurrence on the Cathedral structure after the performed strengthening and reconstruction in 1986.",60008408,University of Zagreb,Zagreb,Croatia,['1706'],20.133333333333333,-0.031510416666666666,0.315625,1
911,911,Built heritage of the dismantled railway network: Main causes of its persistence,"The gradual deterioration experienced by the railway in the mid-20th century precipitated the dismantling of a great part of the once dense rail network, which articulated Europe and many of the most industrialized countries in the world, leaving a large set of infrastructures and buildings in disuse. In just a few decades since the closure of these lines, the existing number of buildings that formed these infrastructures has been decreasing alarmingly. From an academic point of view, most of the papers deal with the reasons for the continuous disappearance and destruction of railway heritage. The object of this article is to expose the main factors that have favoured the conservation of the buildings of those lines that have fallen into disuse, approaching from another perspective the vision of a reality in which both social and cultural aspects will play a role as relevant as architectural, technical and constructive ones. These lead us to the following question: Why are they still standing? To answer this question, more than 231 buildings from six disused railway lines which share similar characteristics, are close to each other and were part of one of the densest railway networks in Europe, such as the one in the Basque Country, have been analysed. Among them, the railway line of the Urola will stand out, due to its general state of preservation, experimented in the number, quality and conservation of its built elements. In this paper, we will present the different evidences why this line, coeval and analogous to the others and whose original buildings have remained almost the same, presents so different results from the rest. We will also determine and quantify the different indicators that could be relevant to define the possible level of recovery of the railway heritage in case of a hypothetical, future intervention, that could be extrapolated to the rest of the cases.",60027856,Universidad del Pais Vasco,Leioa,Spain,['1706'],38.75,0.15449308755760366,0.42672811059907834,1
912,912,Permitting significant harm in the conservation of heritage assets: Conflicts in sustainable land-use planning decisions,"Despite the increasingly divergent legislative framework for land use planning in England and Wales, both planning regimes are characterised by a commitment towards action and decision-taking by public bodies which contribute towards sustainable development (s.39, Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004). The purpose of this is to ensure that the development and use of land facilitates economic, social and environmental progress for present and future generations. The conservation of heritage assets, in a manner appropriate to their significance, forms part of the core planning objectives upon which decisions should be made. However, assessing proposals for the repurposing of built historic assets with sustainable development principles can result in decisions which not only conflict with other aspects of sustainable development, but indeed run counter to it and its protection. This paper examines the implementation of law and policy by local authorities in appraising planning applications concerning the conversion of listed buildings. The article begins by considering the underpinning legal and policy contexts in relation to sustainable development and built heritage in England and Wales. Second, it discusses the duties on decision takers in assessing the merits of planning proposals and the discretionary character of the regimes. Last, drawing on two relevant and recent planning decisions, one of which the author, engaged as the Planning Officer was responsible for evaluating, the paper examines the application of the presumption in favour of sustainable development in proposals which seek to conserve listed buildings. The paper concludes that there is a tangible risk that prioritising the long-term conservation of listed buildings at the expense of other aspects of sustainable development and wider land use planning priorities could result in perverse and harmful outcomes to listed building themselves and to economic, social and environmental progress.",60100434,Birmingham City University,Birmingham,United Kingdom,['1706'],32.111111111111114,0.08083333333333334,0.2520833333333333,1

Sensors are divided into several clusters, and only the nearest cluster is used for target tracking. Each sensor detects a local estimate of the data, and then uploads it to the cluster head node for fusion to get the accurate information of the target. In order to improve positioning accuracy, strong tracking filtering (STF) estimator is used to identify time-varying structural parameters. By orthogonalizing the residual after filtering updating, the fading factor is obtained to correct the filter covariance matrix in real time, which guarantees the tracking ability of the filter to the change of structural parameters. The cluster head node uses the matrix weighted data fusion algorithm to obtain the final fusion results. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the method.",60011592,Qilu University of Technology,Jinan,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.142857142857142,0.1325925925925926,0.5007407407407407,0
914,914,Value of wisdom through experience: Sustainable heritage,"Architectural heritage, like cultural heritage, is a very nourishing resource, providing meaning and wisdom from experience for the next generation. Without heritage, alienation, apathy and ignorance take hold. Human beings thrive from connections between past, present, and future. Yet, today, the field of architecture suffers from a lack of connection to the past. Effects from this can be seen in issues that face the field of architectural heritage, manifest through indifference, ignorance and neglect. Architecture in the past, built upon architectural heritage, both figuratively and literally. Design relied on precedence through documentation and analysis. Existing architecture found new life through adaptive reuse. There was a very comfortable and familiar interaction between old and new. Today, little reference or reverence is given to the past. This approach disengages with heritage, creating a chasm between old and new. The need for architectural heritage has become one dimensional, with a less compelling reason to care beyond an appreciation for what was once deemed valuable. These structures become artifacts of nostalgia in a museum culture. How did we get to a point where architectural heritage mattered so little? It is worth examining the trajectory of and forces behind this development, as well as the current state of architectural education. A review of the 128 accredited schools of architecture in the United States, show that there are only 22 schools of architecture that have a historic preservation component of the curriculum, and only 3 of those schools teach traditional design as a continuum from the past. Architecture schools must invest in heritage as an educational resource and engage with preservation.

917,917,Spanish social housing in the 20th century: Typological analysis of residential complexes built in CastellÔøΩn in the 1950s,"Since the 1940s, populations of Spanish cities have grown intensely, which was motivated mainly by rural emigration. In order to provide housing for such population growth, a great deal of social housing was built. The state would initially and directly control the implementation of this new urban structure by establishing a relative unitary housing typology, especially in the 1950s when most social housing legislation was introduced. These buildings, which helped shape the outskirts of cities at the time, now form part of their consolidated urban pattern, and their image shows the social character that identified these building types.

918,918,Placemaking as an approach to foster cultural tourism in heritage sites,"The accelerating competition among cities brought on by globalization has resulted in a significant concern to harness cultural assets heritage recovery as a form of placemaking to establish relative competitive advantage and consequently attract more visitors and cultural tourism. It is evident that the physical heritage assets and cultural expressions play a substantial part in establishing a sense of place. Other factors related to the needs of tourists and visitors affect the degree of attractiveness and foster greater attachment to the place. In that sense, developing such heritage sites requires a comprehensive approach that considers various aspects in both tangible ‚Äúphysical‚Äù and intangible ‚Äúunphysical‚Äù factors related to those spaces in which it creates authenticity and sense of place. This research attempts to explore the notion of placemaking as an approach for developing and conserving heritage sites, hence, promoting successful cultural tourism that balances the development between people and place. The research will consider using a qualitative approach, supported by statistical analysis through conducting a structured questionnaire for experts in the field in order to verify and weighing the importance of proposed qualities that contribute to building the suggested model.

919,919,Reviving craftsmanship and crafts within the context of industrial architectural heritage,"In this paper, we attempt to redefine the heritage of craftsmanship and to find out how and where it can exist alongside mass-production within our industrialized and digitalized society and within the setup of our industrial architectural heritage. This theoretical background is grounded through a design intervention that injects an urban/architectural program, with interactive public and craftsmen/designers‚Äô spaces, within an urban hiatus that is dominated by an industrial environment of an abandoned early 20th century train station in the vicinity of the seaport of Tripoli, Lebanon. The paper starts by explaining the process of transformation of the notion of craftsmanship and its relationship with manufacturing and mass production since the industrial revolution. It then articulates the recent attempts at reviving craftsmanship through the paradigm of individuation through consumption where craftsmanship becomes not only a means of expressing individuality, but also a communal experience based on technology and digital expertise, and on the role of the designer. Then the paper moves into the design intervention in Tripoli where the revival of craftsmanship is projected onto the domain of revitalization of industrial and architectural heritage, in a place where different historical and architectural eras collapse into a number of abandoned sites and buildings, reconnected and regenerated in a new urban/architectural scheme, in an attempt at rescuing the district from the destined obsolescence it is heading towards. Finally, the paper concludes with highlighting the importance of salvaging potential socioeconomic patterns, especially in the domain of craftsmanship, through a smarter and more sustainable reclaiming of parts of the city that are belittled under the tag of ‚Äúabandoned industrial sites‚Äù or ‚Äúdeserted industrial buildings‚Äù.",121384998,City University,Tripol,Lebanon,['1706'],44.833333333333336,0.04909090909090909,0.4180808080808081,1

All rights reserved.Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) is a technique for creating a single chip by integrating thousands of transistors that are capable of performing various operation. The most important factor to consider in the VLSI design is Power dissipation, which is a critical challenge to create a low-power and high speed circuit. Multiplier has an important function in many processor and computational applications. The system‚Äôs performance mainly depends on the multiplier circuit; so, the main goal of designing a multiplier is to reduce delay and power dissipation. Improved Vedic multiplier architecture with reversible logic can decrease power dissipation and increase a system‚Äôs speed. Optical computing, quantum computing, Nanotechnology and low power design are some of the areas of application in Reversible logic gates.

Alberti retakes the concept and extends it. As far as we know, Lisbon never possessed, during classical antiquity, a port worthy of that name, as Vitruvius described. The justification for the absence of a port¬¥s structures can be due an exceptional characteristic as the natural anchorage ‚Äì ships are protected in Tagus even in stormy days, away from the sea. Here only the tides have effect, by the minor winds and curling/ripples, not obliging thus to the design/construction of the port as it happens in other maritime cities. The Tagus is a pleasant cove ‚Äì ‚ÄúOlisipo‚Äù, interior sea. Francisco de Hollanda planned the city in accordance to the river, assuming it as an essential raw material of the locus.

It also stood out in this period the researches for new materials and traditional materials applied in innovative ways. The stone, for example, began to be adopted as slabs, as part of cladding systems in modern buildings fa√ßades. This shift has raised the question of how to conserve this material as part of fa√ßade systems, a subject underexplored in the Conservation Technology field. Moreover, there are difficulties imposed to the inspection and monitoring of high-rise buildings fa√ßades. In this context, it is proposed to investigate the conservation of stone cladding systems, its characteristics, behaviour and cause and effect relations that affect its ageing. For that, it is adopted as case study the Brazilian Palace of Congress, specifically its 28-story towers. Conceived in the 1960s to be the highest building in the capital, it presents the white marble as one of the elements that confer unity in the modern set of the Palaces of Brasilia. In order to characterize the object of study and its state of conservation, the damages were mapped according to the procedures: i) capture of images by means of a digital camera conducted by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV); ii) digital processing with generation of orthomosaics; and, iii) damage vectoring. Despite the obstacles during the capture of images, such as adverse climatic conditions and the inherent characteristics of marble slabs (white and highly reflective surface, natural pattern easily mistaken with pathological manifestations), the procedures were effective in meeting the proposed objectives.

929,929,Architecture and cultural heritage management tools: Landscape action plans,"In our southern European environment, planning continues to be addressed with 19th-century zoning instruments and defined policies. The growing reaction to the impositions of this territorial policy in local areas proposes a strong bottom-up, non-urbanism of the strategic and the punctual, whose results are beginning to be insufficient due to their limited continuity and difficult coordination. The work in network and with articulated and inter-connectable projects, is revealed, however, as a tool of utility not yet sufficiently tested. To overcome the barrier between what we define as ‚Äúplanning‚Äù or macroterritorial policy and ‚Äúordination‚Äù at a micro level, tools such as Landscape Action Plans (LAP) are proposed. The LAP is structured as a document that, starting from the micro analysis of all facets of the landscape (not only of how it is perceived, but also of its identity generating dimension, and even of its socio-economic aspects), and listening to the demands of the citizens through social dialogue processes, raise a solution to shared problems in local or municipal areas. This solution must be defined not only formally, but applying the determinations emanated from the regional policy of Territorial Planning designed for larger areas. In the last six years, the design of LAP by our Constructed Heritage Research Group (GPAC) has yielded very interesting results in terms of coordinating municipal and regional policies, such as the Landscape Action Plans of Trapagaran (2016) and Ortuella (2018), among others.

The conventional cloud computing paradigm cannot fulfil users' needs, especially for low latency. The new edge computing paradigm is emerging to mitigate the this problem. There has been some prominent research results in the field of edge computing, but most of the work is based on the assumption that edge servers have been deployed at ideal locations, and little attention has been paid to how edge servers are deployed in a geographic area. In this paper, we study how to deploy edge servers cost-effectively so that the collective area of edge servers is maximized under a certain deployment budget. In addition, there are two issues to consider in the deployment of edge servers. The first is the deployment cost, and the second is the area covered by those edge servers. For the first issue, a dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to find a solution. The key idea is to find the maximum area under a given cost. For the second issue, the geometric image approach is used to calculate the area covered by the edge server.

936,936,Traces and scars: The reconstruction of Madrid‚Äôs ciudad universitaria after the Spanish civil war,"Madrid‚Äôs Ciudad Universitaria is a clear example of the different political era that existed in Spain during the 20th century. The project for the campus was first designed during the 1920s under the reign of Alfonso XIII, then developed throughout Spain‚Äôs Second Republic, severely damaged during the Civil War, and finally rebuilt during Franco‚Äôs dictatorship, continuing its expansion until the present. Today, it is also one of the most interesting examples of Spanish architectural heritage, dating from the 20th century. After the partial destruction of the campus during the war, the idea of its reconstruction was imposed over other theses that defended the conservation of the ruins as symbolic and evocative elements. We can still see this today in one of the great models of that time that has been preserved. During the process of restoration of the university complex, the new regime aimed to rebuild Ciudad Universitaria, given its enormous symbolic significance. Parts of the buildings were reconstructed according to the original project, while others were modified and some of them disappeared. The purpose of this study is to analyze the different ways of reconstruction that were carried out on campus from a self-made inventory of the solution implemented on each building. This will allow us to conclude that, to a large extent, the decision taken in the reconstruction was very much related to the position that each building occupied with regard to the war front, and thus the consequent degree of destruction to which it was exposed. The traces of the destruction and the subsequent reconstruction have remained visible over time in most faculties and technical schools.

939,939,Utilizing virtual reality technology in the preservation of architectural heritage: An empirical study of the local architecture of Hijazi identity in the Mecca region of Saudi Arabia,"Architectural documentation is considered one of the first processes that take place in the preservation of historic and archaeological buildings. The emergence of the digital revolution and what it brings from modern technologies provide a new way to document and archive these historic locations. Due to the historical value of these buildings and their status in local heritage, it was deemed important for these locations to be archived in a way that helps in availability and ease of access for scholars and researchers. This paper outlines some methods that reach this goal, alongside an applied example of a historical building (a Hijazi palace in the Mecca Region) modeled in virtual reality. This paper is divided into two sections. The first section focuses on methods of archiving historical locations, while the second focuses on the applied example of the use of VR in archiving. It concentrates on the details of interior architecture to help researchers of interior design. These details have not previously been given attention due to the difficulty of reconstructing life in the time period, and the scarcity of reliable sources on the subject. However, utilizing photographic evidence, some historic illustrations, field visits of other historic buildings of the period, and visits to houses containing personal possessions of people who have lived in these buildings, it is possible to reconstruct spaces from the period in a way that depicts the fine details that represent the lives of the inhabitants of these historic buildings.",60108699,University of Jeddah,Jeddah,Saudi Arabia,['1706'],27.11111111111111,0.04778787878787878,0.23384848484848486,1
940,940,"Historical study of Jinja, Uganda: A city influenced by industrial developments during the early 20th century","This paper evaluates how industrial developments during the first three decades of the 20th century contributed to the founding and growth of Jinja. During this period Jinja grew to become an important inland port on Lake Victoria, a consequence of geography, as well as a multitude of conditions and circumstances linked to colonial developmental policies. The paper presents the socio-economic and socio-political context of colonial patronage which influenced the spatial developments of Jinja. It, however, makes a case that some industrial aspects were in place before Jinja was designated as the pre-eminent industrial hub of Uganda. The paper frames historical narratives through developmental paradigms. By selecting different lenses to cross-examine the growth of Jinja, the paper highlights themes of trade, transport and planning that influenced and shaped the growth of the city. Research for this paper draws primarily on historical information, through critical analysis with reference to embryonic urban centres in other British controlled territories across sub-Saharan Africa, as a means to better situate the conditions that shaped Jinja.

In SFCs, packets comply with the SFC policy to flow through a number of network functions with a strict order and these network functions constitute a Service Function Path (SFP). In this paper, we consider the problem of increasing the network capacity by the way of scaling SFPs for accommodating more packets in case that the network reaches its limitation. To solve this problem, we first construct a multistage graph to guarantee the strict order of network functions and then derive the min cut of SFPs according to the max-flow min-cut theory. Next, a polynomial-time algorithm is presented for SFP scaling that minimizes the transmission cost. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out and the experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.666666666666668,0.103125,0.4239583333333334,0

Consider, e.g., the setting of floating licenses where access can be granted if the request originates in a licensed domain and if the number of active users is within the license limits. Access granting in such scenarios is given in terms of floating authorizations, addressed in this paper as first class entities of a process calculus model, encompassing the notions of domain, accounting and delegation. We present the operational semantics of the model in two equivalent alternative ways, and report on a preliminary investigation of the behavioral semantics, addressing fundamental properties and informing on the specific nature of our authorizations. We also introduce a typing discipline to single out systems that never get stuck due to lacking authorizations, addressing configurations where authorization assignment is not statically prescribed in the system specification.

944,944,Exploratory simulation drilling environment design based on interactive data generation method," All rights reserved.As one of the cutting-edge drilling technologies developed in recent years, intelligent guided drilling technology addresses the problems of drilling complex structural wells and ultra-deep wells under complex geological conditions. In order to provide a simulation environment for intelligent drilling algorithms to meet the actual drilling work, reasonable and reliable 3D geological modeling and visualization work is essential. However, in current geological modeling and visualization work, there are various problems such as insufficient modeling data, poor interaction with agents and lack of exploratory. In view of the above problems, this paper designs an intelligent guided drilling algorithm interactive system that can dynamically generate simulation data based on a small number of geological data samples and construct a three-dimensional geological environment in real time. We propose an interactive data generation mechanism, which can quickly generate simulated LWD (log while drilling) data within the detectable range according to the real-time position of drill bit, and provides a basis for real-time decision making of the intelligent guided drill model. At the same time, the system refers to the uncertainty of the actual formation distribution and adds some randomness in the process of simulating stratigraphic sections. Therefore, based on cross-sectional stacking method combined with the characteristics of intelligent guided drilling algorithms, the 3D geological model of drilling environment can be dynamically constructed during the real-time guiding process. Moreover, exploratory environment modeling method can provide a low-cost, versatile simulation test platform for intelligent guided drilling algorithms.",60016087,China University of Petroleum-Beijing,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",30.5,0.19057971014492753,0.49021739130434794,0

Therefore, architectural heritage is not necessarily focusing on dynamics of memories surrounding it and might be limited to celebrating engineers and architects. In this regard, could it be worth referring to colonial architecture in Africa as heritage sites? To what extent could an architecture that celebrates former oppressors become a heritage site?

946,946,Concrete as heritage: Social perception and its valuing ‚Äì the Zarzuela hippodrome case,"Concrete is the constructive material used to design most of the buildings of the 20th century, some of them of great architectural, historical and cultural relevance. However, the social perception that exists around these constructions, as regards the consideration as architectural and artistic heritage, reflects discordant aspects. Several authors affirm that the 20th century concrete heritage lacks enough appreciation by society, which hinders the tasks to develop or encourage their social consideration and their tourist use. On the other hand, in some cases, this kind of heritage are not considered attractive tourist resources, therefore the maintenance work is no longer a priority, which does not guarantee minimum standards of conservation. In this context, the University of Cadiz leads a European project H2020 called InnovaConcrete, whose aim is to preserve the 20th century monuments built in concrete in countries of the European Union. The Zarzuela Hippodrome (declared an Asset of Cultural Interest in 2009 and inaugurated in 1941, after the Spanish Civil War) has been selected as an ideal example when gathering aspects of economic, social, cultural, aesthetic and architectural functionality. The results obtained, through various surveys and interviews with agents involved, envisage a strong correlation between the widespread ignorance about the historical and architectural value of the building and its depreciation as a heritage element.

948,948,Offloading monocular visual odometry with edge computing: Optimizing image quality in multi-robot systems," All rights reserved.Fleets of autonomous mobile robots are becoming ubiquitous in industrial environments such as logistic warehouses. This ubiquity has led in the Internet of Things field towards more distributed network architectures, which have crystallized under the rising edge and fog computing paradigms. In this paper, we propose the combination of an edge computing approach with computational offloading for mobile robot navigation. As smaller and relatively simpler robots become more capable, their penetration in different domains rises. These large multi-robot systems are often characterized by constrained computational and sensing resources. An efficient computational offloading scheme has the potential to bring multiple operational enhancements. However, with the most cost-effective autonomous navigation method being visual-inertial odometry, streaming high-quality images can induce latency increments with a consequent negative impact on operational performance. In this paper, we analyze the impact that image quality and compression have on the state-of-the-art on visual inertial odometry. Our results indicate that over one order of magnitude in image size and network bandwidth can be reduced without compromising the accuracy of the odometry methods even in challenging environments. This opens the door to further optimization by dynamically assessing the trade-off between image quality, network load, latency and performance of the visual-inertial odometry and localization accuracy.",60006876,Turun yliopisto,Turku,Finland,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",20.7,0.18690476190476193,0.5043650793650793,0

Under the background of unscented kalman filtering (UKF), the adaptive factor is constructed by using the Innovation vector, and the adaptive adjustment of noise covariance in charge estimation is realized. The comparison between AUKF and UKF shows that the proposed method has better estimation accuracy.

950,950,"Characterisation of historical lighthouses as industrial heritage elements: Application to the lighthouse of the Island of Santa Clara, Spain","Lighthouses are a symbiosis of architecture and technology, combining a tower, an adjacent building with living quarters and stores, and technology that produces signals for sailors. They must be permanently in operation and they must be unmistakably distinguished from other nearby lighthouses. They are extremely versatile elements that satisfy several functions in addition to the light signals. The authors consider that traditional lighthouses, commissioned in the mid-19th century, are genuine signalling factories, and that they must be studied as such, based on the concepts defined by the UNESCO documents, among others, for industrial heritage. Recently, the Institute of Cultural Heritage of Spain (IPCE), dependent upon the Government of Spain, has considered lighthouses with a historical value as industrial heritage elements. The authors accept this consideration and as such, in 2017, the drafting of the Catalogue of Lighthouses with heritage value in Spain was commissioned by the IPCE. A large number of projects are being activated today to include tourist uses in the lighthouses. However, it has been detected that these projects eliminate tangible and intangible materials that irreversibly distort the lighthouse as an example of our industrial heritage. The paper aims to detect the characteristics that must be assessed to establish the heritage value of historical lighthouses and propose a procedure for their evaluation. By way of an example, the value of the lighthouse of the Island of Santa Clara in Donostia-San Sebastian (Spain) is analysed from the viewpoint of its pertinence to the industrial heritage.

951,951,Structural performance of concrete elements retrofitted by a geopolymer strengthening system: Input in the rehabilitation of historical buildings,"Rehabilitation of historic buildings is a priority since their structural elements suffered from various levels of damage that took place during their service life. Recently, geopolymer is gaining acceptance as an emerging material in the construction industry due to its added advantages. It has shown excellent bond strength to concrete substrate, lower creep and shrinkage, greater durability in severe environments and higher temperature and fire resistance. Geopolymer is relatively new in the rehabilitation system of building structures, although it had been used for new construction applications. Therefore, an effort was made to gather information on the use of geopolymer as repair and strengthening material. This paper reviewed the structural performance of geopolymer-strengthened concrete elements and the field applications of geopolymer as strengthening material for historical buildings. Information from the literature revealed that the load capacity of the non-damaged and fully damaged reinforced concrete (RC) beam can be increased by 12% and 100%, respectively, when strengthened using plain geopolymer. It was found that short fiber-reinforced geopolymer (SFRG) strengthening system enhanced the peak load of RC beam by 15% while 370% if using continuous fiber-reinforced geopolymer (CFRG). To date, field applications of geopolymer strengthening system on historical buildings were limited, nevertheless this technique provided good structural performance making it suitable in the rehabilitation process.",60011373,Danmarks Tekniske Universitet,Lyngby,Denmark,['1706'],23.555555555555557,0.1656006493506493,0.35920454545454544,1

Cultural tourism includes film tourism, which consists of those places where cinema and TV productions have been shot. This can contribute to valuing the local cultural heritage or, by contrast, to reifying it and, consequently, to the loss of its authentic and its identity. In the following article we propose a system of indicators of sustainable development in order to evaluate and guarantee long-term sustainability in those places identified with traditional cultural heritage and that have become film sceneries. Once the study cases have been identified, the cultural landscapes that are going to be evaluated will be defined. To do that, we will identify and select the film sceneries according to the degree of conciliation between these and cultural heritage. The impact on society of the cinema productions will also be taken into account. The union amongst the film sceneries through the local heritage (built heritage, landscape heritage, etc.) will result in one or several cultural landscapes where the balance between the welfare of the host society and the tourism demands will be evaluated. To put into practice the following methodology, the Historic Centre of Pe√±√≠scola has been chosen to be evaluated.

Traditional Bahraini houses were designed with specific features and characteristics to cater to the cultural and religious needs of the occupants and the bio-climatic conditions. This study has investigated the impact of the mashrabiya on daylight performance within a space and examined how it affects the quantity and quality of the daylight that is admitted into the space. A field study was conducted in one of the traditional houses in Bahrain for evaluating the performance of the mashrabiya in providing daylight in the space. The studied room was located on the upper floor and had an L shape layout (27.75 m2). The main wall of this room faced the north with openings covered with mashrabiya, while the inner part of the room (the south wall) overlooked an atrium with a skylight. The south wall had two small openings that increased the illumination level in a small part of the room. The results showed that the performance of daylight throughout the mashrabiya was better, to some extent, than without any screen. The mashrabiya in this case can provide the level of illuminance recommended for residential activities and can provide better uniformity as compared to the space without a mashrabiya. The mashrabiya device is capable of reducing the impact of glare in the whole space. It is preferable to improve the design of the mashrabiya to enhance the uniformity of daylight in the space. The chromaticity of light in the space, as the CCT calculation for all the measured points below the accepted level, was another challenge with regards to the performance of the mashrabiya device. A mashrabiya is likely to demonstrate a more successful performance and better daylighting if it is designed and modified to consider uniformity and the chromaticity of light in the space.",60104334,Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal university,Dammam,Saudi Arabia,['1706'],24.307692307692307,0.16319444444444445,0.4572916666666667,1
956,956,Architectural renewal: A rising dawn in ile-ife?,"‚ÄúConservation‚Äù, as a word frequently in use colloquially, has several nuances. In its most common usage, it is tantamount to ‚Äúpreservation‚Äù. However, the term ‚Äúarchitectural conservation‚Äù invariably relates to heritage structures deemed worthy of conservation-restoration intervention because of their latent iconic cultural significance. ‚ÄúRenewal‚Äù, on its part, extends the frontiers of restoration: while putting back what was lost, it accommodates some change in the original, so as to extend the current usefulness and general relevance of the heritage structure, i.e. it is synonymous with ‚Äúadaptive re-use‚Äù. Even at the level of government intervention, relatively very little is going on in Nigeria in terms of heritage-structure conservation. Private (family) concern for architectural renewal of historic property is a rarity. Notwithstanding this relative neglect of Nigeria‚Äôs heritage architecture, all over the country there are many worthy samples of the nation‚Äôs building culture, attesting to the rich prospects of their conservation and renewal. The ancient city of Ile-Ife is not left out of this tourism (and other) potential of heritage architecture. The paper adopts the case-study approach in discussing some experimental work in architectural heritage renewal being undertaken in Ile-Ife. Specifically, two buildings, Lowa‚Äôs House and the Odeyemi Family House, are critiqued, setting out the factors predisposing them to socio-cultural and architectural significance, and highlighting the unique features introduced to make them contemporarily relevant.

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving authentication scheme in VANETs. We explore the strategy of a local blockchain for VANETs. We make use of a private blockchain for authentication and a public blockchain for managing event messages. The trusted authority (TA) is responsible for making the transactions in the private blockchain within the boundary of the countries, the transactions are the identity information required for authentication of vehicles when they join the network for the first time, the other vehicles have the right to read and check from the private blockchain the authenticity of a new vehicle. The public blockchain is used for storing the event messages within the boundary of pre-defined regions to ensure the security of message dissemination, we called this kind of blockchain road-side unit blockchain (RSU-BC) because it takes the role of RSU in a VANET. In this way, we eliminate the necessity of RSU's deployment in VANETs and reduce the dependency on the TA.

Today it is impossible to find a market in which there is no competition, so the problem of competitiveness of the firm is relevant and requires constant research. There are many definitions of the concept of managing a firm's competitiveness. In this article, after analyzing the different approaches, a generalized definition is derived. In unstable market conditions, the success of the firm in the market depends on its competitiveness, timely establishment of strategic goals, flexibility of the production system, which is ensured by the accuracy and timeliness of management decisions. Effective management of the firm in the market conditions is essentially reduced to the management of its competitiveness (to the assessment and analysis of factors that increase or decrease the competitiveness of the firm, the choice and implementation of appropriate strategies and tactics to achieve a particular goal). Since today in the world of high technology it is more difficult for a firm to survive, the firms themselves, which use as many methods of management as possible, will be more interesting for investors, what is the result of the introduction of certain innovations.

965,965,Influence of economic indicators on supply chain: Evidence from Indonesian fishing industry,"The supply chain dynamics has been broadly examined and experienced by the academes, industrialists as well as economists. However, still the literature is missing with the effect of economic indicators on supply chain practices, particularly in fishing industry. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to examine the role of economic indicators on supply chain in fishing industry of Indonesia. Fishing industry is one of the industries which is working from many centuries and now growing rapidly and considered to be the important element of economic growth in different countries like Indonesia. Six hypotheses were formulated with the help of previous studies, concerning the relationship between inflation rate, interest rate, human development index (HDI), gross domestic product (GDP) and supply chain. GDP was considered as the mediating variable. Managerial employees of fishing companies were selected as the respondents of this study. Primary data was collected by conducting the questionnaire survey. Total number of one hundred and ninety-six (196) response were received. These responses were analysed with the help of statistical software namely; Partial Least Square (PLS). It was found that economic indicators have influence on supply chain. Increases in inflation rate and interest rate decreases the supply chain. However, increases in HDI enhances the GDP and promote supply chain activities. Additionally, GDP is a mediating variable between HDI and supply chain which positively enhances the supply chain through HDI. Thus, study provides the clues for government to promote supply chain by controlling inflation and interest rate.",60002763,Universiti Utara Malaysia,Sintok,Malaysia,['1710'],16.46666666666667,0.11771694214876036,0.3571797520661157,1

However, it is only a good estimator when dealing with symmetrical data. If the data is not symmetrical, then the mean is no longer a good estimator, but the median is. The recent two-sided group chain acceptance sampling plans (TSGChSP) has only been applied to Pareto distribution of the 2nd kind by using the mean to cater for symmetrical data. In reality, some data are actually non-symmetrical. Hence, motivated by such scenario, the aim of this study is to produce the TSGChSP for Pareto distribution of the 2nd kind by using the median. The performances of TSGChSP are measured based on minimum number of groups, g and probability of lot acceptance, L(p). The g is calculated by satisfying the consumer's risk while the L(p) is obtained at several values of median ratio. Finally, the number of million revolutions for 23 ball bearings is shown in order to show the application of the TSGChSP in the industry.",60002763,Universiti Utara Malaysia,Sintok,Malaysia,['1710'],19.666666666666668,0.14407894736842106,0.5730263157894737,1

975,975,Transformation of the views of China on the problem of supply chain management of territorial regulation of the borders of India in the last quarter of the XX century,"After the death of Mao Zedong in September 1976, the PRC opens a new page in its foreign policy history. This is mostly due to the reforms and transformations that Deng Xiaoping proclaimed. The change of sociopolitical and economic structures that had taken place laid the foundation for China's entry into world leaders in some positions. By the time Deng Xiaoping came to power, the Chinese economy was in decline after the ""political adventures"" of Mao Zedong. To get out of this situation, it was necessary to liberalize the economic and social sectors, as well as solve a whole range of foreign policy problems (from establishing official diplomatic relations with the USA and improving relations with the USSR, to solving the problems of Hong Kong and Macao) in order to become a harmonious part of the world community. To strengthen its position in the Asia-Pacific region, China needed, first of all, to establish relations with all its neighbours and resolve territorial disputes, of which there were many. This article is supposed to consider the question of the attempts of the PRC to resolve existing differences on the disputed parts of the borders with the Republic of India. In the period under review, China had several territorial disputes with its neighbours, which did not allow to realize the foreign policy potential, and there was also not a sufficient number of allies and economic partners of the PRC. As an example of a solution to border disputes, one can cite a positive result achieved in the course of negotiations with the USSR on the demarcation of the border. If China managed to achieve its goals with its northern neighbor, the question with India still remains open. In our study, an attempt will be made to analyse the course of the negotiation process between the PRC and the Republic of India in the last quarter of the 20th century and to identify the reasons for the lack of a decision on this issue. This analysis is interesting not only in terms of forecasting the development of the situation in the APR but also within the framework of other territorial problems of the PRC.",60107804,The Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration,Moscow,Russian Federation,['1710'],30.0,0.07591540404040405,0.3413194444444445,1

The correlation and regression analysis also revealed the dependence of the operational risk level on liquidity risks (current and long-term liquidity ratios) and crediting risks (the amount of overdue debt, the aggregate risk for bank insiders, and reserves for possible losses on loans and equivalent debt). It has been proved that with the growth of current and long-term liquidity ratios, overdue debts and reserves for possible losses on a loan, loan debt and its equivalent ratios, the operational risks of credit organizations in Russia grow, whereas with an increase in the aggregate risk for bank insiders (H10.1), the level of operational risks of the banking sector is reduced. The values of operational risk in the banking sector of the Russian Federation are predicted on the basis of the scenario approach for 2019-2020. As part of the pessimistic and moderate growth scenario, an increase in the level of operational risks is predicted, which makes it necessary to implement new approaches to managing this type of risk in credit institutions and introduce new methods of managing operational risk by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.",60070941,Kazan Federal University,Kazan,Russian Federation,['1710'],39.4,0.020979020979020976,0.43531468531468526,1

The study reviewed literature found in numerous scholarly and peerreviewed journals using supply chain risk and risk mitigation as the main search words to filter articles that discuss related topics. The preliminary finding was that there is generally an underrepresentation of Africa in supply chain management literature. It also found that studies discussing supply chain risk and mitigation issues in Africa have focused mainly on the challenges of sourcing in Africa. Another observation was that literature provides some limited insights on how supply chain management tools such as total quality management, negotiation and supplier selection, and just-in-time procurement may be implemented in African countries. However, the available literature manifests significant limitations in scope, both empirically and theoretically when compared to the vast amount of contributions from emerging economies in Asia as well as developed economies.

In addition, a symplectic pseudospectral receding horizon control (RHC) controller is designed to solve the trajectory tracking problem where the constraints on the state and control variables are considered. The proposed compound trajectory planning method is first applied to a two-aircraft problem. The obtained results demonstrate that compared to the RVO and Dubins-RVO methods, the proposed method can effectively avoid the &#x201C;dead-lock&#x201D; phenomenon and generate feasible trajectory efficiently satisfying all constraints. In addition, simulation experiment for four aircrafts is conducted. Smooth trajectories are obtained.

991,991,Enabling Workforce Optimization in Constrained Attribute Based Access Control Systems,"IEEEEffective utilization of human capital is one of the key requirements for any successful business endeavor, with reorganization necessary if there are nonproductive employees or employees that are retiring. However, while reorganizing tasks for newer employees, it should be ensured that the employees have the requisite capabilities of handling the assigned tasks. Furthermore, security constraints forbid any arbitrary assignment of tasks to employees and also enforce major dependencies on other employees who have access to the same tasks. Since Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is poised to emerge as the de facto model for specifying access control policies in commercial information systems, we consider organizational policies and constraints to be modeled with ABAC. In this work, we define the Employee Replacement Problem (ERP) which answers the question of whether a given set of employees can be replaced by a smaller set of employees, while ensuring that the desired security constraints are not violated. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and use CNF-SAT to obtain a solution.

This study, hence proposes a type of novel CNTs distribution for improving the stiffness of CNTRC beams. The distributions are in the nonlinear forms and ensure the same total CNT volume fraction along the thickness of structures. For demonstrating, the effectiveness of the proposed CNT distributions, the static, free vibration and buckling analyses of functionally graded carbon nanotube (FG-CNT) reinforced composite beams using the new CNT distributions are conducted and one-dimensional NURSB basis functions based on the third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) are utilized to describe the exact geometry and to approximate the unknown solution in finite element model of the beam. The numerical investigations of the geometric and material parameters reveal that the new nonlinear CNT distributions can help increase the normalized frequency, buckling load and the nondimensional central deflection to the maxima of 8%, 16% and 16% respectively, in some conditions of geometric parameters.",60107345,Institute for Computational Science and Technology,Ho Chi Minh City,Viet Nam,['1701'],36.0,0.06794990723562153,0.5304962894248607,1

By employing a classical additive hardware distortion model, the joint hardware impairment effects brought by both access points (APs) and user equipments have been taken into account, whereas the eavesdropper is assumed to be equipped with perfect hardware. Thereby, we derive a closed-form lower bound for the ergodic secrecy rate in the presence of imperfect channel state information. To obtain further insights, we investigate asymptotic secrecy performance under different hardware scaling factors. It proves that the hardware-quality scaling effect vanishes as the number of APs increases in the considered secure cell-free massive MIMO system with active attack. Furthermore, by using continuous approximation and path-following algorithms, the optimal power allocation scheme is obtained to maximize the achievable secrecy rate.

996,996,Evolutionary Collaborative Human-UAV Search for Escaped Criminals,"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for target searching in complex environments has increased considerably in recent years. The numerous studies on UAV search methods have been reported, but few have been conducted on collaborative human-UAV search which is common in many applications. In this paper, we present a problem of collaborative human-UAV search for escaped criminals, the aim of which is to minimize the expected time of capture rather than detection. We show that our problem is much more complex than the problem of pure UAV search. The difficulty of our problem is further increased by the fact that criminals will attempt to avoid detection and capture. To solve the problem, we propose a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (EA) that uses three evolutionary operators, namely, comprehensive learning, variable mutation, and local search, to efficiently explore the solution space. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some well-known EAs and other popular UAV search methods on test instances. An application of our method to a real-world operation took 311 min to capture a criminal who had escaped for over three days, validating its practicability and performance advantage. This paper provides a good basis for promoting the application of EAs to a wider class of man-machine collaboration scheduling problems.",60069734,Logistical Engineering University China,Chongqing,China,"['1712', '1703']",23.333333333333332,0.049404761904761896,0.4097222222222222,1

998,998,Color temperature tuning: Allowing accurate post-capture white-balance editing,"The in-camera imaging pipeline consists of several routines that render the sensor's scene-referred raw-RGB image to the final display-referred standard RGB (sRGB) image. One of the crucial routines applied in the pipeline is white balance (WB). WB is performed to normalize the color cast caused by the scene's illumination, which is often described using correlated color temperature. WB is applied early in the in-camera pipeline and is followed by a number of nonlinear color manipulations. Because of these nonlinear steps, it is challenging to modify an image's WB with a different color temperature in the sRGB image. As a result, if an sRGB image is processed with the wrong color temperature, the image will have a strong color cast that cannot be easily corrected. To address this problem, we propose an imaging framework that renders a small number of ""tiny versions"" of the original image (e.g., 0.1% of the full-size image), each with different WB color temperatures. Rendering these tiny images requires minimal overhead from the camera pipeline. These tiny images are sufficient to allow color mapping functions to be computed that can map the full-sized sRGB image to appear as if it was rendered with any of the tiny images' color temperature. Moreover, by blending the color mapping functions, we can map the output sRGB image to appear as if it was rendered through the camera pipeline with any color temperature. These mapping functions can be stored as a JPEG comment with less than 6 KB overhead. We demonstrate that this capture framework can significantly outperform existing solutions targeting post-capture WB editing.",60033420,York University,Toronto,Canada,['1707'],21.916666666666668,0.05714285714285714,0.5551587301587301,1

In this instance, the input and the output are spectral data of a painting. We trained the model to have pigments concentration as compressed information as a middle output. We used the dataset which was obtained from 19 pigments. The dataset has scattering coefficient and absorption coefficient of each pigment. We applied Kubelka-Munk theory to the coefficients to obtain many patterns of spectral data.

Vividness has recently it been proposed as a formal colour scale, and it is believed to be more intuitive than other colour science terms. In this work we investigate how people interpret vividness of colour samples and test current models by collecting visual data in a psychophysical experiment. 31 people were asked to judge the vividness of 53 NCS patches and 53 colour matches on display on a scale from 0 to 100. The majority of the variations in the vividness data is predicted by chroma, while the results indicate that lightness does not contribute in prediction of the observers' interpretation of vividness.

However, the fundamental question of how humans truly perceive texture still remains. In the present study, using a series of textile samples, the most important perceptual attributes people use to interpret and evaluate the texture properties of textiles were accumulated through the verbal description of texture by a group of participants. Smooth, soft, homogeneous, geometric variation, random, repeating, regular, color variation, strong, and complicated were ten of the most frequently used words by participants to describe texture. Since the participants were allowed to freely interact with the textiles, the accumulated texture properties are most likely a combination of visual and tactile information. Each individual texture attribute was rated by another group of participants via rank ordering. Analyzing the correlations between various texture attributes showed strong positive and negative correlations between some of the attributes. Principal component analysis on the rank ordering data indicated that there is a clear separation of perceptual texture attributes in terms of homogeneity and regularity on one hand, and non-homogeneity and randomness on the other hand.",60013141,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,['1707'],23.625,0.04111305361305361,0.4998991393222162,1

In this paper, we investigated the perceived quality of portrait images depending on how the target skin color is defined: measured, memory, digital, or CCT skin color variations. A user study was conducted; 24 participants assessed the quality of white-balanced portraits on five criteria: reality, naturalness, appropriateness, preference, and emotional enhancement. The results showed that the calibration using measured skin color best served the aspects of reality and naturalness. With regard to appropriateness and preference, digital skin color obtained the highest score. Also, the memory skin color was appropriate to calibrate portraits with emotional enhancement. In addition, the other two CCT target colors enhanced the affective quality of portrait images, but the effect was quite marginal.

Quantifying and modeling the impact of geometry, as well as comprehensive understanding of the translucency perception process, are a point of not only academic, but also industrial interest with 3D printing as an example among many. We hypothesize that a presence of thin areas in the object facilitates material translucency estimation and changes in material properties have larger impact on apparent translucency of the objects with thin areas. Computergenerated images of objects with various geometry and thickness have been used for a psychophysical experiment in order to quantify apparent translucency difference between objects while varying material absorption and scattering properties.

1005,1005,Improvement of blood pressure estimation from face video using RGB camera,"In this paper, we investigated the correlation between blood pressure (BP) and image-based pulse transit time (iPTT) acquired from only face using RGB camera. In general, the value of iPTT can be calculated from a transition time at peaks of hemoglobin amount which is extracted from RGB values of the camera. The transition time of peaks is obtained by time of the peak at the face and the palm. In the previous research, it is known that there is a correlation between BP and iPTT. Therefore, blood pressure can be estimated by acquiring iPTT from video taken using RGB camera. However, it is necessary to take video of face and palm simultaneously in this conventional iPTT measurement method. It is difficult to take the video of face and palm simultaneously. In order to solve this problem, we investigated whether iPTT can be acquired from a single part of body. At first, we took a video of face and palm using a high-speed camera and investigated whether the pulse wave flow can be observed. As a result, we were able to observe the propagation of the pulse wave in the regions of face and palm. Hence, iPTT acquisition from the single part of body is expected to be possible in these two parts. Next, we set a region of interest (ROI) on the chin and the forehead for the face, and the center of the palm and thenar for the palm. Then, pulse waves were extracted from each region, and iPTT was calculated from each part. We found that iPTT acquired from face is long and stable, but iPTT acquired from palm is short and unstable. Moreover, we examined the correlation between blood pressure and iPTT acquired from face. Consequently, a correlation was found between blood pressure and iPTT acquired from only face.",60002787,Chiba University,Chiba,Japan,['1707'],18.875,-0.023669467787114845,0.5065126050420168,1

This study was carefully designed to systematically vary the adapting luminance and chromaticities to investigate whether the adapting luminance and chromaticities jointly affect the degree of chromatic adaptation. Human observers adjusted the color of a stimulus produced by a self-luminous display to make it appear the whitest under each of the 17 different adapting conditions. It was found the adapting chromaticities and luminance jointly affected the degree of chromatic adaptation. At a same adapting luminance level, the degree of chromatic adaptation was found lower under a lower adapting CCT (i.e., 2700 and 3500 K).

CIECAM02, the most widely used color appearance model, and many other color appearance models were all developed based on corresponding color datasets, including LUTCHI data. Though the effect of adapting light level on color appearance, which is known as ""Hunt Effect"", is well known, most of the corresponding color datasets were collected within a limited range of light levels (i.e., below 700 cd/m2), which was much lower than that under daylight. A recent study investigating color preference of an artwork under various light levels from 20 to 15000 lx suggested that the existing color appearance models may not accurately characterize the color appearance of stimuli under extremely high light levels, based on the assumption that the same preference judgements were due to the same color appearance. This article reports a psychophysical study, which was designed to directly collect corresponding colors under two light levels- 100 and 3000 cd/m2 (i.e., ~ 314 and 9420 lx). Human observers completed haploscopic color matching for four color stimuli (i.e., red, green, blue, and yellow) under the two light levels at 2700 or 6500 K.

In this study, nine lighting conditions, with different correlated color temperature (CCT) levels and light levels, were created in a real-world environment. Under each lighting condition, human observers adjusted the color appearance of a virtual stimulus, which was overlaid on a real-world luminous environment, until it appeared the whitest.

However, there is a lack of research directly about the perceived diffuse white in HDR images. Three experiments were conducted to explore the perceptual estimation of diffuse white in real HDR images when presented on displays. The first experiment showed that the perceptual estimation of diffuse white relied more on the image content than the clipped peak luminance levels. Experiment II used images with different neutral density filters rather than clipping. The normalized luminance levels of the perceptual estimation were similar, depending on image content but not on image absolute luminance levels. Moreover, in both experiments, no significant difference can be found between expert and naive observers. The variance across images agreed with each other between experiment I and II. However, both results demonstrated that the absolute luminance level of observers' estimation is higher than the calibrated diffuse white level. Experiment III focused on exploring the impact of measurement methodologies on the absolute luminance level of the estimated diffuse white. Results of experiment III verified that the absolute luminance level of the perceptual estimation can be manipulated by the measurement methodology but the variance across image content is stable.",60103907,Nippon Hoso Kyokai,Tokyo,Japan,['1707'],18.181818181818183,0.08988095238095237,0.4706349206349207,1
1017,1017,A testing paradigm for quantifying ICC profilers,"To reproduce colors in one system which differs from another system in terms of the color gamut, it is necessary to use a color gamut mapping process. This color gamut mapping is a method to translate a specific color from a medium (screen, digital camera, scanner, digital file, etc) into another system having a difference in gamut volume. There are different rendering intent options defined by the International Color Consortium [5] to use the different reproduction goals of the user [19]. Any rendering intent used to reproduce colors, includes profile engine decisions to do it, i.e. looking for color accuracy, vivid colors or pleasing reproduction of images. Using the same decisions on different profile engines, the final visual output can look different (more than one Just Noticeable Difference[16]) depending on the profile engine used and the color algorithms that they implement. Profile performance substantially depends on the profiler engine used to create them. Different profilers provide the user with varying levels of liberty to design a profile for their color management needs and preference. The motivation of this study is to rank the performance of various market leading profiler engines on the basis of different metrics designed specifically to report the performance of particular aspects of these profiles. The study helped us take valuable decisions regarding profile performance without any visual assessment to decide on the best profiler engine.",101094834,HP Inc.,Barcelona,Spain,['1707'],22.9,0.04722222222222222,0.434920634920635,1

Obscuring power and the way textile samples block light can define product quality and customer satisfaction in the lingerie, shirting, and curtain industries. While the question whether opacity implies the complete absence of light transmission remains open, various factors can impact cues used for opacity assessment. We propose that perceived opacity has poor consistency across various conditions and it can be dramatically impacted by the presence of a high-illuminance light source. We have conducted psychophysical experiments asking human subjects to classify textile samples into opaque and non-opaque categories under different illumination conditions. We have observed interesting behavioral patterns and cues used for opacity assessment. Finally, we found obvious indications that the high-illuminance light source has a significant impact on opacity perception of some textile samples, and to model the impact based on material properties remains a promising direction for future work.",60013141,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,['1707'],21.571428571428573,0.14539473684210527,0.5526315789473684,1

Total of 6 different black luminance levels (0.003, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 1 cd/m2) were used in the experiment. Total of 20 participants was invited to evaluate the image quality. For the experiment, twelve test images are used and these test images categorized into three groups as dark, medium bright and bright image group by image histogram distribution. Each image is rendered by adjusting six different black luminance levels. Result found that the black level is higher than 0.1 cd/m2, the preference for the image is decreased. The best performance is achieved when the black level is 0.003 cd/m2, but there is no big difference from 0.1 cd/m2.

The performance of these metrics is measured using different tools such as PLCC, SROCC, KROCC and RMSE based on the only publically available database from Nanjing university.

Recent research on affect analysis has addressed the non-contact multi-modal analysis of affect aimed at such applications as automated questionnaires. New modalities are needed to develop a more accurate system for analyzing affects than the current system. Thus we focus on emotional sweating, which is among the most reliable modalities in contact methods for affect analysis. However, sweat detection on the human skin has not been achieved by other researchers, and thus it is unclear whether their feature values are useful. The proposed method is based on feature values of color and glossiness obtained from images. In tests of this method, the error rate was approximately 6.5% on a skin phantom and at least approximately 12.7% on human skin.

This estimation can bring various capabilities of color reproduction for the newfangled 3D printer that can apply multi-layered inkjet color. Especially, the control of translucency is useful for the reproduction of skin color that is overpainted flesh color on bloody-red layer. Conventional method of this layer design and color selection depended on the experience of professional designer. However, it is difficult to optimize the color selection and layer design for reproducing complex colors with many layers. Therefore, in this research, we developed an efficiency estimation of color layout for human skin with arbitrary translucency by using machine learning. Our proposed method employs PSF measurement for quantifying the color translucency of overlapped layers. The machine learning was performed by using the correspondence between these measured PSFs and multi-layered printings with 5-layer neural network. The result was evaluated in the CG simulation with the combination of 14 colors and 10 layers. The result shows that our proposed method can derive an appropriate combination which reproduce the appearance close to the target color and translucency.",60082079,Tokyo Metropolitan College of Technology,Tokyo,Japan,['1707'],19.1,0.03809523809523809,0.4464285714285714,1

Here smoothness can refer to the level of unexpected changes or discontinuities in color transitions (at a macro scale) or the level of local variation (at a micro scale), sometimes also described as grain. This paper starts with presenting an approach to building a first-ever set of metameric printed samples that match in color but vary in grain, followed by a psychovisual study of smoothness perception based on a large number of evaluations by both experts and non-experts. This data shows high levels of intra- and inter-observer correlation and can therefore serve as a robust ground truth for understanding and modelling the print smoothness phenomenon. Then, a previously published predictive smoothness model is revisited, that estimates smoothness from a digital halftone before it is printed, and it is shown to result in high degrees of correlation between observer assigned smoothness judgments and computationally predicted scores. The paper also reports the results of tuning the smoothness metrics parameters to further enhance is alignment with the psychovisual ground truth.",101094834,HP Inc.,Barcelona,Spain,['1707'],30.0,0.07047619047619048,0.3898412698412698,1

Viewed as a tone mapping operation, CLHE generates a tone curve with bounded max and min slopes. It is this boundedness which ensures that the processed images have more detail but few artefacts. Outside of limiting contrast, recent improvements to histogram equalisation include constraining the tone curve to make good whites and blacks and constraining the tone curve to be smooth. This paper makes three contributions. First, we show that the CLHE formalism is not least-squares optimal but optimality can be achieved by reformulating the problem in a quadratic programming framework. Second, we incorporate the additional constraints of tone curve smoothness and good whites and blacks in our quadratic programming CLHE framework.

Artefacts are a necessary consequence of the per channel color processing and the lack of any strong control for controlling the locality of the processing (halos are very local errors). In this paper we relate an input to the corresponding output processed retinex image by using a single shading term which is both spatially varying and smooth and a global colour shift. This coupling dramatically reduces common Retinex artefacts.

Most of the prior art only attempts to solve this problem for fixed exposure conditions, and this limits the usefulness of these approaches (they can work inside the lab but not in the real world). In this paper, we seek methods that work well even when exposure is unknown or varies across an image, namely 'exposure invariance'. We begin by re-examining three main approaches - regression, sparse coding and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) - from a varying exposure viewpoint. All three of these approaches are predominantly implemented assuming a fixed capturing condition. However, the leading sparse coding approach (which is almost the best approach overall) is shown to be exposure-invariant, and this teaches that exposure invariance need not come at the cost of poorer overall performance. This result in turn encouraged us to revisit the regression approach. Remarkably, we show that a very simple root-polynomial regression model - which by construction is exposure-invariant - provides competitive performance without any of the complexity inherent in sparse coding or DNNs.",60000112,University of East Anglia,Norwich,United Kingdom,['1707'],22.875,0.19404761904761905,0.3605442176870749,1

We deduce an Euler-Lagrange equation and a second variational inequality. The second variational inequality is remarkably sim- ple in its form.

Gloss is one of the important qualities for materials. A visual test of the sharpness of a specular reflection image, i.e. gloss, on the surface of materials is often performed to estimate the gloss of materials. If the specular reflection image is sharp, we estimate that it has high gloss. This means that gloss can be estimated by measuring the sharpness of the specular reflection image. In this case, a line light source such as a fluorescent lamp is often used. Here we call it the line light source observation method. We developed a measurement apparatus based on the line light source observation method. As a result of experimental verification, it is confirmed that the Line Spread Function of Specular Reflection (SR-LSF) can be derived from the line light source observation images. However, the reflected image of line light source observation method is considered to be strictly different from SR-LSF. On the other hand, it is clarified that the line source observation method is an approximate SR-LSF measurement method.

1037,1037,Beyond raw-RGB and sRGB: Advocating access to a colorimetric image state,"Most modern cameras allow captured images to be saved in two color spaces: (1) raw-RGB and (2) standard RGB (sRGB). The raw-RGB image represents a scene-referred sensor image whose RGB values are specific to the color sensitivities of the sensor's color filter array. The sRGB image represents a displayreferred image that has been rendered through the camera's image signal processor (ISP). The rendering process involves several camera-specific photo-finishing manipulations intended to make the sRGB image visually pleasing. For applications that want to use a camera for purposes beyond photography, both the raw-RGB and sRGB color spaces are undesirable. For example, because the raw-RGB color space is dependent on the camera's sensor, it is challenging to develop applications that work across multiple cameras. Similarly, the camera-specific photo-finishing operations used to render sRGB images also hinder applications intended to run on different cameras. Interestingly, the ISP camera pipeline includes a colorimetric conversion stage where the raw-RGB images are converted to a device-independent color space. However, this image state is not accessible. In this paper, we advocate for the ability to access the colorimetric image state and recommend that cameras output a third image format that is based on this device-independent colorimetric space. To this end, we perform experiments to demonstrate that image pixel values in a colorimetric space are more similar across different makes and models than sRGB and raw-RGB.",60033420,York University,Toronto,Canada,['1707'],20.727272727272727,0.07426470588235294,0.37058823529411766,1

The algorithm produces greyscale reproductions that preserve detail derived from local colour differences in the original colour image. Such detail is extracted by using linear anisotropic diffusion to build a greyscale reproduction from a gradient of the original image that is in turn calculated using Riemannised colour metrics. The purpose of the current paper is to re-evaluate one of the psychometric experiments for these Wo methods (CIELAB L‚àó and anisotropic ŒîE99) by using a flipping method to compare their resulting images instead of the side by side method used in the original evaluation. In addition to testing the two selected algorithms, a third greyscale reproduction was manually created (colour graded) using a colour correction software commonly used to process motion pictures. Results of the psychometric experiment found that when comparing images using the flipping method, there was a statistically significant difference between the anisotropic ŒîE99 and CIELAB L‚àó conversions that favored the anisotropic method.

Our method is aimed at opaque materials with a highly glossy surface like plastic, ceramic, and metals. Hence, the material surface is assumed to be not a perfect mirror, but a surface with some roughness. We do not use a goniospectrophometer nor an image-based measurement setup. Instead, we make use of a gloss meter with a function to measure the specular profile, containing for glossy materials appearance such as roughness, sharpness, and intensity. The surface reflection is represented as a linear sum of diffuse and specular reflection components, the latter described by the Cook-Torrance model.

1046,1046,Colour image enhancement using perceptual saturation and vividness,A perceptual study was conducted to enhance colour image quality in terms of naturalness and preference using perceptual scales of saturation and vividness. Saturation scale has been extensively used for this purpose while vividness has been little used. We used perceptual scales of a recently developed colour appearance model based on Jzazbz uniform colour space. A two-fold aim of the study was (i) to test performance of recently developed perceptual scales of saturation and vividness compared with previously used hypothetical models and (ii) to compare performance and chose one of saturation and vividness scales for colour image enhancement in future. Test images were first transformed to Jzazbz colour space and their saturation and vividness were then decreased or increased to obtain 6 different variants of the image. Categorical judgment method was used to judge preference and naturalness of different variants of the test images and results are reported.,60013141,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,['1707'],24.666666666666668,-0.030416666666666668,0.39583333333333337,1
1047,1047,Physical noise propagation in color image construction: A geometrical interpretation,"To avoid false colors, classical color sensors cut infrared wavelengths for which silicon is sensitive (with the use of an infrared cutoff filter called IR-cut). However, in low light situation, noise can alter images. To increase the amount of photons received by the sensor, in other words, the sensor's sensitivity, it has been proposed to remove the IR-cut for low light applications. In this paper, we analyze if this methodology is beneficial from a signal to noise ratio point of view when the wanted result is a color image. For this aim we recall the formalism behind physical raw image acquisition and color reconstruction. A comparative study is carried out between one classical color sensor and one specific color sensor designed for low light conditions. Simulated results have been computed for both sensors under same exposure settings and show that raw signal to noise ratio is better for the low light sensor. However, its reconstructed color image appears more noisy. Our formalism illustrates geometrically the reasons of this degradation in the case of the low light sensor. It is due on one hand to the higher correlation between spectral channels and on the other hand to the near infrared part of the signal in the raw data which is not intrinsically useful for color.",60104653,Universite Grenoble Alpes,Saint Martin d'Heres,France,['1707'],21.4,0.06492042440318303,0.4138783630162941,1

1049,1049,Printing with light: Daylight-fluorescent inks for large-gamut multi-color printing,"With printing technologies continuously reaching ever higher degrees of performance an/qualify, the need for novelty andimpact and also keeps increasing Specialty inks have always played an important role here, albeit not without challenges. Often the use of such materials involved dedicated solutions that deal with these inks outside of the constraints of normal pipelines and workflows, which constrains their application and results in Hmited use. This is so since specialty inks, such as fluorescents, behave differently to traditional dye or pigment-based ones. So much so that most applications use specialty inks as spot colors, explicitly determining (by means of a separate layer in the input) where they are to be used for given content. For example, for materials such as fluorescents or quantum dots, the possibility of presenting more light at a given wLlength than is incident at that wavelength, breaks some of the basic assumptions of current processes from how they are measured to how they can be used in building color separations all the way to how color management deals with them. In this paper we describe first experiments of using fluorescent inks that are activated by visible-instead ofthe more customary UV-radiation, showing performance of spectrophotometer measurement with a dedicated model to handle the specific properties of these inks, as well as results ofthe impact such inks can have on extending color gamuts that go significantly beyond current printing gamuts and therefore also pose new challenges.",60107879,HP Inc.,Bengaluru,India,['1707'],39.666666666666664,0.17435064935064934,0.47918470418470416,1
1050,1050,Quantitative assessment of color tracking and gray tracking in color displays medical,"The goal of this study is to develop quantitative metrics for evaluating color tracking and gray tracking in a color medical display. Color tracking is the chromaticity consistency of the red, green, or blue shades. Gray tracking is the chromaticity consistency of the gray shades. Color tracking and gray tracking are the most important colorimetric responses of a color medical display because they directly indicate the color calibration quality and can therefore be used to compare color performance between displays. Two metrics, primary purity and gray purity, are defined to measure the color shift of the primary shades and gray shades of a color display, respectively. The area under the curves of primary purity and gray purity can then represent the quality of color tracking (C-AUC) and gray tracking (G-AUC), respectively. Fifteen displays including medical, professional-grade, consumer-grade, mobile, and special displays were tested to compare their C-AUC and G-AUC. The OLED displays have the greatest C-AUC values. The medical and professional-grade displays have the greatest combinations of C-AUC and G-AUC values. Most consumer-grade displays have lower C-AUC and G-AUC values, but some show better gray tracking than color tracking. The special displays exhibit particularly poor color and gray tracking.

1051,1051,Angular color prediction model for anisotropic halftone prints on a metallic substrate,"Under specular reflection, non-isotropic halftones such as line halftones printed on an ink-receiving plastic layer superposed with a metallic layer change their colors upon in-plane rotation of the print. This color change is due to the orientation-dependent optical dot gain of the halftone. A strong dot gain occurs when the incident light is perpendicular to the halftone line structure. A color prediction model is proposed which predicts under specular reflection the color of cyan, magenta and yellow line halftones as a function of the azimuthal rotation angle, the incident angle and the line frequency. The model is calibrated by measuring 17 reflectances at the (25¬∞ V 25¬∞) measurement geometry, with the incident light parallel to the halftone lines. The model has been tested for several azimuthal rotation and incident viewing angles, each time for 125 different cyan, magenta and yellow ink surface coverages.

In the experiment, eighteen lighting stimuli were provided by combining six chromaticities and three placements. A total of 177 women aged 20 to 69 participated and assessed the lighting stimuli using ten affective scales. Based on the assessments, we derived four aspects to describe the characteristics of lighting styles: performance, aesthetics, visual comfort, and overall satisfaction. Specifically, cool white lighting placed in front appealed the well-functioning, performance support aspect. Further, when the shelves were lit in magenta-white, the refrigerator interior was evaluated to be the most attractive. When visual comfort matters more, shelf lighting in cyan-white would be optimal. An age effect was also discovered. Younger participants in their 20s and 30s preferred cool white when lit indirectly. Participants over 40, however, found magenta-white more attractive, especially when they viewed it directly.

1053,1053,Perceived glossiness: Beyond surface properties,"Gloss is widely accepted as a surface- and illuminationbased property, both by definition and by means of metrology. However, mechanisms of gloss perception are yet to be fully understood. Potential cues generating gloss perception can be a product of phenomena other than surface reflection and can vary from person to person. While human observers are less likely to be capable of inverting optics, they might also fail predicting the origin of the cues. Therefore, we hypothesize that color and translucency could also impact perceived glossiness. In order to validate our hypothesis, we conducted series of psychophysical experiments asking observers to rank objects by their glossiness. The objects had the identical surface geometry and shape but different color and translucency. The experiments have demonstrated that people do not perceive objects with identical surface equally glossy. Human subjects are usually able to rank objects of identical surface by their glossiness. However, the strategy used for ranking varies across the groups of people.",60013141,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,['1707'],16.0,-0.1279761904761905,0.5011904761904761,1

Two psychophysical experiments were carried out for the evaluation of tone mapping operators. In the first experiment, a set of high quality images were generated to possess right extents of image features including contrast, colourfulness and sharpness. These images were further used in the second experiment as reference images to evaluate different TMOs. It was found Reinhard's photographic reproduction based on local TMO gave an overall better performance.

First, a large set of spectral images is acquired from a variety of scenes of fluorescent objects paired with a mutual illumination effect under different conditions. The target fluorescent object is constructed using a cube and a flat plate supporting it, and is subsequently illuminated using a directional light source. We produce many target objects of the same size with different fluorescent materials and observe them under different illumination conditions. The observed spectral images are subsequently decomposed into five components, combining the spectral functions and geometric factors. The reference geometric factors are independent of the material, illuminant, and illumination direction change; instead, they are only dependent on object geometries. A reliable estimation method of reference geometric factors is presented using the whole spectral images observed under various conditions. Further, we propose an algorithm for reconstructing a realistic appearance including mutual illumination effect under arbitrary conditions of material, illuminant, and illumination direction. Finally, the reliability of the proposed approach is examined experimentally.",60021994,Nagano University,Ueda,Japan,['1707'],20.555555555555557,0.08436147186147186,0.44637445887445887,1

Based on a customer-oriented strategy and theories of organizational information processing theory, three-dimensional (3D) concurrent engineering and resource dependency, the purpose of this paper is to propose a sequential model reflecting the sequence of practices as well as an overview picture for a firm to achieve MC. Design/methodology/approach: The model links three company antecedents ‚Äì postponement orientation, operational alignment and information sharing, to three company supply chain practices ‚Äì product and process modularity and supplier segmentation. These practices, in turn, lead to the company‚Äôs MC capabilities. The proposed model is tested with a data set collected from automotive suppliers in China and in the USA. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the data and test the model. Findings: The results suggest that, for suppliers to achieve MC, postponement orientation and operational alignment are vital antecedents. The results also reveal the important responsibility and role of information sharing practices in coordinating suppliers‚Äô modularity practices. Originality/value: This research provides three findings that are of value to both academicians and practitioners of supply chain management. First, this study originally proposed and empirically tested that a postponement orientation is an antecedent of product and process modularity and supplier segmentation to achieve MC in the automotive sector, contrary to the traditional view of parallel relationships for both.

Our paper empirically examines consumer choice behavior based on past experiences, using data from Japanese hairdressing salons, which consist of salon introductions and individual reviews of those salons.

1071,1071,Optimized energy aware resource allocation algorithm using software defined network technology," All rights reserved.The number of data centers (DCs) used for storing and processing data has evolved rapidly in recent years. However, the operations held by DCs may relate to a number of disadvantages, primarily presuming in excessive energy and power consumption due to the poor management standards applied. This may lead to a situation in which many devices within the DC operate at full capacity without any tasks assigned for actual execution. A Software Defined Network (SDN) is a network architecture where the control plane is an independent entity from the data plane, yielding to a higher controllability and flexibility over the network. Through the utilization of SDN architecture, a highly functional energy aware network may be established. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm that monitors the current status of an SDN network (in addition to all ingoing and outgoing traffic), in order to dynamically and efficiently allocate network resources by ensuring that only the necessary network devices are active and by turning the idle ones off. The results show that the proposed algorithm reduces energy consumption of the network compared to existing solutions.",60070814,University of Wollongong in Dubai,Dubai,United Arab Emirates,['1705'],26.714285714285715,0.06260416666666667,0.5181250000000001,0
1072,1072,Multimedia mathematical communication in a diverse group of students," All rights reserved.The article tackles the problem of improving mathematical communication in a group of students with different visual impairment levels, under the guidance of a group leader or a teacher. Visually impaired persons face a problem while learning mathematics. The said problem results from the specific nature in which mathematical content (formulas, function graphs, geometrical figures and projections of solids) is recorded and presented. The effectiveness of learning mathematics is boosted when students work in a group moderated by a leader. This requires them to share documents, with the leader being able to keep track of the individual work of each participant, and with the group discussing specific solutions. In order for a visually impaired student to be able to participate in and contribute to the work of the group, either remotely or locally, all participants must use universal IT tools that support visually impaired students without complicating the work of others. This paper presents interactive multimedia solutions developed under two research projects carried out by the author. The said solutions support communication in mathematics. Results of qualitative surveys on new solutions are presented, confirming their usefulness and the measurable impact they exert on the efficiency of the group's work concerning mathematical problems.",60085241,"Naukowej i Akademickiej Sieci Komputerowej, Warszawa",Warsaw,Poland,['1705'],22.77777777777778,0.07272727272727272,0.19144385026737967,0
1073,1073,Representing temporal dependencies in human activity recognition,"Smart Homes offer the opportunity to perform continuous, long-term behavioural and vitals monitoring of residents, which may be employed to aid diagnosis and management of chronic conditions without placing additional strain on health services. A profile of the resident's behaviour can be produced from sensor data, and then compared over time. Activity Recognition is a primary challenge for profile generation, however many of the approaches adopted fail to take full advantage of the inherent temporal dependencies that exist in the activities taking place. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of recurrent neural network that uses previously learned examples to inform classification decisions. In this paper we present a variety of approaches to human activity recognition using LSTMs and consider the temporal dependencies that exist in binary ambient sensor data in order to produce case-based representations. These LSTM approaches are compared to the performance of a selection of baseline classification algorithms on several real world datasets. In general, it was found that accuracy in LSTMs improved as additional temporal information was presented to the classifier.",60011885,Robert Gordon University,Aberdeen,United Kingdom,['1700'],25.142857142857142,0.07673992673992674,0.32765567765567766,1

1075,1075,Autonomous navigation control of UAV using wireless smart meter devices," All rights reserved.In preparation for the upcoming home delivery services that rely on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), we developed a new multi-hop radio network that is laid over a smart meter network transferring electric energy information only. In this network, a UAV follows, for navigation purposes, the topology of a virtual network overlaid on the physical smart meter network. We established a service management control method which does not rely on image analysis or map information processing, i.e. processes that consume precious power resources of the UAV. Instead, navigation is based on the routing technology. The current distance between the UAV and a node of the smart meter network is measured by means of the radio transmission loss value, therefore determining the position of the UAV. A two-layer network model has been proposed. One layer consists of a network of nodes in a residential area with scattered buildings - a location that is safer to navigate - while the other is an access network of nodes in a densely populated area. Then, we proposed methods to determine the direction of movement towards the next hop node on the data-link layer and the end node on the network layer, which is the target destination.

This phase will not only help the agent build its knowledge about the discrepancy, but also forms a basis for its adapted behavior. In the second phase, the agent transforms the knowledge attained from the first phase to explain its behavior to the human operator. This knowledge includes both the causal understanding of the discrepancy and the reasoning behind its adapted behavior. In the final phase, the agent uses the feedback from the human counterpart to adapt its causal knowledge as well as its reasoning behind the behavior adaptation.

Moreover, the hardware and software of existing freight stations fall short of the demand for D-P transport. To solve these problems, this paper optimizes the design of the D-P transport network based on shared freight station and the hub-and-spoke (H-S) network. The freight stations were taken as the hubs, and the routes between supply/demand point and freight station are treated as spokes. On this basis, an optimization model was established to minimize the total cost of freight stations and maximize the force from freight stations on supply/demand points in the H-S D-P network. In addition, all the supply/demand points in the region are covered by the selected freight stations. The LINGO software was introduced to solve the established model. Taking a region in southern China for example, the proposed shared freight station design was compared with the traditional freight station design. The results show that the single-hub H-S D-P network obtained by the traditional design could meet the demand when the D-P demand was relatively small; however, only the multi-hub H-S D-P network obtained by the shared freight station design could fulfil a large D-P demand in an efficient manner.

1099,1099,Constructing prototypes for classification using epigenetic and genetic analysis,"Researchers seek to identify biological markers which accurately differentiate cancer subtypes and their severity from normal controls. One such biomarker, DNA methylation, has recently become more prevalent in genetic research studies in oncology. This project seeks to apply the innovative and adaptive machine learning methodology in case-based reasoning (CBR) to examine DNA methylation levels in breast cancer. Instead of relying on a generalized knowledge-base, CBR uses highly specific information extracted from similar cases which can also greatly expedite the process of finding a solution. Further, this can locate targeted biomarkers by reusing homogenous factors, or revising to locate novel biomarkers in highly heterogeneous samples. While locating these biomarkers, this project proposes to use CBR to classify samples, predict prognoses and determine survival factors.",60014235,State University of New York at Oswego,Oswego,United States,['1700'],20.5,0.2281818181818182,0.5316666666666667,1

In this paper, we propose a feature recognition method to quickly verify whether user‚Äôs handwritten signature image is matched the record stored in the feature-based electronic handwritten-signature database (FEHS-DB) or not. The FEHS-DB is pre-established via records learning process. After the signing the signature by the user, the signature image is outputted as a same-size image. Then, the image will be taken its center point, and use the concentric circles in order to capture the intersection. Finally, these features are compared with the learned record in the FEHS-DB. The specific features retrieved by our scheme from the signature image could easily identify the signature is true or not. In addition, we show that the recognition speed is very fast than the traditional schemes.",60031941,China Medical University Hospital Taichung,Taichung,Taiwan,"['1706', '1705', '1710']",17.77777777777778,0.15204545454545457,0.5443939393939394,1

One of the treatment for the patients is alveolar bone grafting. In Thailand, spiral CT scan has been extensively utilized in the diagnosis in order to examine the lesions on facial bone. However, spiral CT scans are expensive, relatively large and immobile. In this study, we evaluated the application of moveable CT scan. The important pre-operative information such as the shape of the alveolar cleft, the volume of the alveolar cleft, teeth, and tip of dental roots around alveolar cleft are required for treatment planning. Normally, plastic surgeons measured and evaluated these quantities in the operating room. Differently, the cleft lip and cleft palate patients underwent mobile CT for the pre-operative period. And with computer-aided design software, plastic surgeons worked collaboratively with engineers to process output and perform measurement pre-operatively. Our study shows that the pre-operative information from computer-aided design can increase understanding for alveolar cleft anatomy.

Today, Cloud provider gives conveyance of registering as an administration. Contingent upon the administration, the colossal data is shared over the system and this tremendous measure of information is put away in the cloud service provider. Henceforth, security is a noteworthy worry for the information in the cloud. Different encryption calculations were combined for securing the information in the cloud. Yet at the same time, the information is not secure in the cloud because of different assaults on the information. Thus, another method called Homomorphic encryption is presented which is a smart thought that enables particular operations to be performed on the scrambled information. In this paper, we propose hybrid homomorphic encryption calculation for giving improved security and secrecy of the information that is put away in the cloud. The Encryption procedure is conveyed by utilizing Hyper Elliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) calculation, which creates a key, this resultant key is sent to the cloud provider where Homomorphic multiplicative operations are combined to the scrambled key. Hence, the encoded key is put away in the cloud which can be gotten to whenever. Since the cloud supplier has the scrambled key no other individual can have the capacity to know which operation has been performed. Consequently security and confirmation is upgraded. For the best Performance and most incredible security of cloud computing, this paper proposed homomorphic hybrid encryption strategy.
