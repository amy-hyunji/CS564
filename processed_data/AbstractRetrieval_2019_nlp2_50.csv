0,0,0,Box-driven class-wise region masking and filling rate guided loss for weakly supervised semantic segmentation,"Semantic segmentation has achieved huge progress via adopting deep Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). However, the performance of FCN based models severely rely on the amounts of pixel-level annotations which are expensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, it is a good choice to learn to segment with weak supervision from bounding boxes. How to make full use of the class-level and region-level supervisions from bounding boxes is the critical challenge for the weakly supervised learning task. In this paper, we first introduce a box-driven class-wise masking model (BCM) to remove irrelevant regions of each class. Moreover, based on the pixel-level segment proposal generated from the bounding box supervision, we could calculate the mean filling rates of each class to serve as an important prior cue, then we propose a filling rate guided adaptive loss (FR-Loss) to help the model ignore the wrongly labeled pixels in proposals. Unlike previous methods directly training models with the fixed individual segment proposals, our method can adjust the model learning with global statistical information. Thus it can help reduce the negative impacts from wrongly labeled proposals. We evaluate the proposed method on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark and compare with other methods. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and achieves the state-of-the-art results.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707']",21.3,-0.005929487179487176,0.5575320512820514,1,0.16666666666666666,0.027131782945736434,0.3516949152542373

2,2,2,Building detail-sensitive semantic segmentation networks with polynomial pooling,"Semantic segmentation is an important computer vision task, which aims to allocate a semantic label to each pixel in an image. When training a segmentation model, it is common to fine-tune a classification network pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. However, as an intrinsic property of the classification model, invariance to spatial perturbation resulting from the lose of detail-sensitivity prevents segmentation networks from achieving high performance. The use of standard poolings is one of the key factors for this invariance. The most common standard poolings are max and average pooling. Max pooling can increase both the invariance to spatial perturbations and the non-linearity of the networks. Average pooling, on the other hand, is sensitive to spatial perturbations, but is a linear function. For semantic segmentation, we prefer both the preservation of detailed cues within a local feature region and non-linearity that increases a network's functional complexity. In this work, we propose a polynomial pooling (P-pooling) function that finds an intermediate form between max and average pooling to provide an optimally balanced and self-adjusted pooling strategy for semantic segmentation. The P-pooling is differentiable and can be applied into a variety of pre-trained networks. Extensive studies on the PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes and ADE20k datasets demonstrate the superiority of P-pooling over other poolings. Experiments on various network architectures and state-of-the-art training strategies also show that models with P-pooling layers consistently outperform those directly fine-tuned using pre-trained classification models.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707']",19.5,0.030500000000000006,0.4561666666666667,1,0.09556313993174062,0.023890784982935155,0.3281853281853282

However, the weighted fuzzy utility mining problem cannot hold the downward-closure property. We thus design an upper-bound model to prevent information loss in mining.

5,5,5,RangeNet ++: Fast and Accurate LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,"Perception in autonomous vehicles is often carried out through a suite of different sensing modalities. Given the massive amount of openly available labeled RGB data and the advent of high-quality deep learning algorithms for image-based recognition, high-level semantic perception tasks are pre-dominantly solved using high-resolution cameras. As a result of that, other sensor modalities potentially useful for this task are often ignored. In this paper, we push the state of the art in LiDAR-only semantic segmentation forward in order to provide another independent source of semantic information to the vehicle. Our approach can accurately perform full semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds at sensor frame rate. We exploit range images as an intermediate representation in combination with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) exploiting the rotating LiDAR sensor model. To obtain accurate results, we propose a novel post-processing algorithm that deals with problems arising from this intermediate representation such as discretization errors and blurry CNN outputs. We implemented and thoroughly evaluated our approach including several comparisons to the state of the art.

More recently, these systems are increasingly being used to render all sort of socially-sensitive decisions. Yet, these automated decisions can lead, even in the absence of an intention, to a lack of fairness in the sense that members sharing one or more sensitive attributes are being treated unequally. In this paper, we handle unfairness in both online and offline settings. We introduce an algorithm-agnostic learning mechanism for optimal and non-discriminative decision-making as appropriate. This translates to a fairness-aware learning schema which can be immediately applied to most existing algorithms and to general decision-making tasks in dynamic settings with join data distribution changes over time.",60024997,"University of Maryland, Baltimore County",Baltimore,United States,"['1706', '1712']",20.5,0.2862179487179487,0.4897435897435898,1,0.12666666666666668,0.006666666666666667,0.34328358208955223
7,7,7,Efficient attribute reduction with submodular function optimization,"Attribute Reduction problem is an important content in Rough Set theory, which has been proven to be NP-hard. It tends to find a subset of attributes that preserve the same discriminatory power as the entire attributes. Heuristics methods are used to find the minimum attribute subset. In this paper, we use three typical heuristic methods to do Attribute Reduction. They are positive-region-based, discernibility-matrix-based and mutual-information-based Attribute Reduction algorithm. Experimental results validate that all the three algorithms have good performance on classification for symbolic data. However, the computational complexity of the three Attribute Reduction algorithms are all O(n^2), so it s hard to apply them to massive data. In order to improve the efficiency of the three Attribute Reduction algorithms, we remodel the objective of them from the perspective of Submodular Function Optimization with submodular optimization strategies. We first optimize the attribute selection process with Lazy-Greedy strategy and then extend the serial algorithm to a parallel version according to the parallel optimization strategy of submodular functions.

Conventional methods apply xnor and bitcount operations in binary convolution with notable quantization error, which usually obtains inconsistent signs in binary feature maps compared with their full-precision counterpart and leads to significant information loss. In contrast, our CI-BCNN mines the channel-wise interactions, through which prior knowledge is provided to alleviate inconsistency of signs in binary feature maps and preserves the information of input samples during inference. Specifically, we mine the channel-wise interactions by a reinforcement learning model, and impose channel-wise priors on the intermediate feature maps through the interacted bitcount function.

10,11,11,Aanet: Attribute attention network for person re-identifications,"This paper proposes Attribute Attention Network (AANet), a new architecture that integrates person attributes and attribute attention maps into a classification framework to solve the person re-identification (re-ID) problem. Many person re-ID models typically employ semantic cues such as body parts or human pose to improve the re-ID performance. Attribute information, however, is often not utilized. The proposed AANet leverages on a baseline model that uses body parts and integrates the key attribute information in an unified learning framework. The AANet consists of a global person ID task, a part detection task and a crucial attribute detection task. By estimating the class responses of individual attributes and combining them to form the attribute attention map (AAM), a very strong discriminatory representation is constructed.

In this paper, we develop a new model for high rank matrix completion (HRMC), together with batch and online methods to fit the model and out-of-sample extension to complete new data. The method works by (implicitly) mapping the data into a high dimensional polynomial feature space using the kernel trick; importantly, the data occupies a low dimensional subspace in this feature space, even when the original data matrix is of full-rank. The online method can handle streaming or sequential data and adapt to non-stationary latent structure, and enjoys much lower space and time complexity than previous methods for HRMC. For example, the time complexity is reduced from O(n 3) to O(r 3), where n is the number of data points, r is the matrix rank in the feature space, and rll n.

However, current state-of-the-art neural network models designed for graph learning, eg, graph convolutional networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT), inadequately utilize edge features, especially multi-dimensional edge features. In this paper, we build a new framework for a family of new graph neural network models that can more sufficiently exploit edge features, including those of undirected or multi-dimensional edges. The proposed framework can consolidate current graph neural network models, e.g., GCN and GAT. The proposed framework and new models have the following novelties: First, we propose to use doubly stochastic normalization of graph edge features instead of the commonly used row or symmetric normalization approaches used in current graph neural networks. Second, we construct new formulas for the operations in each individual layer so that they can handle multi-dimensional edge features. Third, for the proposed new framework, edge features are adaptive across network layers. As a result, our proposed new framework and new models are able to exploit a rich source of graph edge information. We apply our new models to graph node classification on several citation networks, whole graph classification, and regression on several molecular datasets.

This holds true for learned single-image denoising algorithms, which are applied to real raw camera sensor readings but, due to practical constraints, are often trained on synthetic image data. Though it is understood that generalizing from synthetic to real images requires careful consideration of the noise properties of camera sensors, the other aspects of an image processing pipeline (such as gain, color correction, and tone mapping) are often overlooked, despite their significant effect on how raw measurements are transformed into finished images. To address this, we present a technique to 'unprocess' images by inverting each step of an image processing pipeline, thereby allowing us to synthesize realistic raw sensor measurements from commonly available Internet photos. We additionally model the relevant components of an image processing pipeline when evaluating our loss function, which allows training to be aware of all relevant photometric processing that will occur after denoising.

16,17,17,Group sampling for scale invariant face detection,"Detectors based on deep learning tend to detect multi-scale faces on a single input image for efficiency. Recent works, such as FPN and SSD, generally use feature maps from multiple layers with different spatial resolutions to detect objects at different scales, e.g., high-resolution feature maps for small objects. However, we find that such multi-layer prediction is not necessary. Faces at all scales can be well detected with features from a single layer of the network. In this paper, we carefully examine the factors affecting face detection across a large range of scales, and conclude that the balance of training samples, including both positive and negative ones, at different scales is the key. We propose a group sampling method which divides the anchors into several groups according to the scale, and ensure that the number of samples for each group is the same during training.

Due to its highly subjective nature, different annotators often exhibit different interpretations of scales when adopting absolute value tests. Therefore, recent investigations turn to collect pairwise comparisons via crowdsourcing platforms. However, crowdsourcing data usually contains outliers. For this purpose, it is desired to develop a robust model for learning SVP from crowdsourced noisy annotations. In this paper, we construct a deep SVP prediction model which not only leads to better detection of annotation outliers but also enables learning with extremely sparse annotations. Specifically, we construct a comparison multi-graph based on the collected annotations, where different labeling results correspond to edges with different directions between two vertexes.

Despite impressive progress, these systems are known to be vulnerable to physical disturbances, such as accidental or adversarial bumps that make them drop the manipulated object. They also tend to be distracted by visual disturbances such as objects moving in the robot's field of view, even if the disturbance does not physically prevent the execution of the task. In this paper, we propose an approach for augmenting a deep visuomotor policy trained through demonstrations with Task Focused visual Attention (TFA). The manipulation task is specified with a natural language text such as 'move the red bowl to the left'. This allows the visual attention component to concentrate on the current object that the robot needs to manipulate. We show that even in benign environments, the TFA allows the policy to consistently outperform a variant with no attention mechanism. More importantly, the new policy is significantly more robust: It regularly recovers from severe physical disturbances (such as bumps causing it to drop the object) from which the baseline policy, i.e. with no visual attention, almost never recovers. In addition, we show that the proposed policy performs correctly in the presence of a wide class of visual disturbances, exhibiting a behavior reminiscent of human selective visual attention experiments.",60022144,University of Central Florida,Orlando,United States,"['1712', '1707']",22.1,0.07144886363636363,0.29875124875124875,1,0.10887096774193548,0.008064516129032258,0.2862903225806452

This method, called Nesti-Net, builds on a new local point cloud representation which consists of multi-scale point statistics (MuPS), estimated on a local coarse Gaussian grid. This representation is a suitable input to a CNN architecture. The normals are estimated using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, which relies on a data-driven approach for selecting the optimal scale around each point and encourages sub-network specialization. Interesting insights into the network's resource distribution are provided. The scale prediction significantly improves robustness to different noise levels, point density variations and different levels of detail.

Most of the current successful approaches for gait recognition either use a pair of gait images to form a cross-gait representation or rely on a single gait image for unique-gait representation. These two types of representations emperically complement one another. In this paper, we propose a new Joint Unique-gait and Cross-gait Network (JUCNet), to combine the advantages of unique-gait representation with that of cross-gait representation, leading to an significantly improved performance. Another key contribution of this paper is a novel quintuplet loss function, which simultaneously increases the inter-class differences by pushing representations extracted from different subjects apart and decreases the intra-class variations by pulling representations extracted from the same subject together.

To address this issue, we propose to leverage on eye movement dynamics inspired by neurological studies. Studies show that there exist several common eye movement types, independent of viewing contents and subjects, such as fixation, saccade, and smooth pursuits. Incorporating generic eye movement dynamics can therefore improve the generalization capabilities. In particular, we propose a novel Dynamic Gaze Transition Network (DGTN) to capture the underlying eye movement dynamics and serve as the topdown gaze prior.

24,25,25,Neural rejuvenation: Improving deep network training by enhancing computational resource utilization,"In this paper, we study the problem of improving computational resource utilization of neural networks. Deep neural networks are usually over-parameterized for their tasks in order to achieve good performances, thus are likely to have underutilized computational resources. This observation motivates a lot of research topics, e.g. network pruning, architecture search, etc. As models with higher computational costs (e.g. more parameters or more computations) usually have better performances, we study the problem of improving the resource utilization of neural networks so that their potentials can be further realized. To this end, we propose a novel optimization method named Neural Rejuvenation. As its name suggests, our method detects dead neurons and computes resource utilization in real time, rejuvenates dead neurons by resource reallocation and reinitialization, and trains them with new training schemes. By simply replacing standard optimizers with Neural Rejuvenation, we are able to improve the performances of neural networks by a very large margin while using similar training efforts and maintaining their original resource usages.

Previous methods often assume that a complete sketch is used as input; however, hand-drawn sketches in common application scenarios are often incomplete, which makes sketch recognition a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose SketchGAN, a new generative adversarial network (GAN) based approach that jointly completes and recognizes a sketch, boosting the performance of both tasks. Specifically, we use a cascade Encode-Decoder network to complete the input sketch in an iterative manner, and employ an auxiliary sketch recognition task to recognize the completed sketch.

Space vehicle travels through continuum as well as rarefied region during flight. Continuum region aerodynamics can be predicted by solving Navier Stokes equation. Explicit schemes require low computational hardware facility but increase computational time by limiting time step to a certain limit defined by stability criteria.

27,28,28,Divide and conquer the embedding space for metric learning,"Learning the embedding space, where semantically similar objects are located close together and dissimilar objects far apart, is a cornerstone of many computer vision applications. Existing approaches usually learn a single metric in the embedding space for all available data points, which may have a very complex non-uniform distribution with different notions of similarity between objects, e.g. appearance, shape, color or semantic meaning. Approaches for learning a single distance metric often struggle to encode all different types of relationships and do not generalize well. In this work, we propose a novel easy-to-implement divide and conquer approach for deep metric learning, which significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance of metric learning. Our approach utilizes the embedding space more efficiently by jointly splitting the embedding space and data into K smaller sub-problems. It divides both, the data and the embedding space into K subsets and learns K separate distance metrics in the non-overlapping subspaces of the embedding space, defined by groups of neurons in the embedding layer of the neural network. The proposed approach increases the convergence speed and improves generalization since the complexity of each sub-problem is reduced compared to the original one. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin in retrieval, clustering and re-identification tasks on CUB200-2011, CARS196, Stanford Online Products, In-shop Clothes and PKU VehicleID datasets.

However, so far, no prior art realizes this. We introduce a novel query-guided end-to-end person search network (QEEPS) to address both aspects.

Recently, there has been growing interest in the design of new high-performance CW-ToF coding functions. However, these functions are typically designed in a hardware agnostic manner, i.e., without considering the practical device limitations, such as bandwidth, source power, digital (binary) function generation. Therefore, despite theoretical improvements, practical implementation of these functions remains a challenge. We present a constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions that adhere to hardware constraints. The optimization problem is non-convex with a large search space and no known globally optimal solutions. To make the problem tractable, we design an iterative, alternating least-squares algorithm, along with convex relaxation of the constraints.

35,36,36,An online retrieval question answering system for featured snippets triggering,"In current search engines, there are two ways to display the results of Question style User Queries (QUQs), the natural results and Featured Snippet (FS). Actually, a search engine that triggers a FS can better satisfy the user's information seeking need, and the data format of FS is usually formulated as Question Answer Pairs (QAPs) in the dictionary. In this setting, an answer can be retrieved as a FS if and only if the QUQ and the question in QAPs are matched. The traditional retrieval method is basically based on keywords, which failed to bridge the semantic gap. On the other hand, neural matching methods may not be deployed online directly due to the high flexibility requirements in complex real-world scenarios. To this end, this paper combines retrieval model and matching model in a unified system for FS triggering. This system contains two stages: the recall stage and the ranking stage. In the recall stage, for a QUQ, we use the vector-based retrieval model rather than the BOW (bag of words)-based one to ensure accurate and quick recall of possible candidates from QAPs. In the ranking stage, we use the ensemble method on multiple models, including pre-trained network BERT, to boost matching performance.

43,44,44,Learning view priors for single-view 3D reconstruction,"There is some ambiguity in the 3D shape of an object when the number of observed views is small. Because of this ambiguity, although a 3D object reconstructor can be trained using a single view or a few views per object, reconstructed shapes only fit the observed views and appear incorrect from the unobserved viewpoints. To reconstruct shapes that look reasonable from any viewpoint, we propose to train a discriminator that learns prior knowledge regarding possible views. The discriminator is trained to distinguish the reconstructed views of the observed viewpoints from those of the unobserved viewpoints. The reconstructor is trained to correct unobserved views by fooling the discriminator.

44,45,45,Image-to-image translation via group-wise deep whitening-and-coloring transformation,"Recently, unsupervised exemplar-based image-to-image translation, conditioned on a given exemplar without the paired data, has accomplished substantial advancements. In order to transfer the information from an exemplar to an input image, existing methods often use a normalization technique, e.g., adaptive instance normalization, that controls the channel-wise statistics of an input activation map at a particular layer, such as the mean and the variance. Meanwhile, style transfer approaches similar task to image translation by nature, demonstrated superior performance by using the higher-order statistics such as covariance among channels in representing a style. In detail, it works via whitening (given a zero-mean input feature, transforming its covariance matrix into the identity). followed by coloring (changing the covariance matrix of the whitened feature to those of the style feature). However, applying this approach in image translation is computationally intensive and error-prone due to the expensive time complexity and its non-trivial backpropagation. In response, this paper proposes an end-to-end approach tailored for image translation that efficiently approximates this transformation with our novel regularization methods. We further extend our approach to a group-wise form for memory and time efficiency as well as image quality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is fast, both in training and inference, and highly effective in reflecting the style of an exemplar.",60094206,"LG Electronics, Korea",Seoul,South Korea,"['1712', '1707']",24.0,0.06636904761904762,0.5270833333333332,1,0.11235955056179775,0.0,0.2816326530612245

Further, previous research has mostly been confined to association-based linear approaches and post-game prediction, with limited assessment of predictive machine learning (ML) models in a pre-game setting. Therefore, our aim was to use ML techniques to predict game outcomes and produce a hierarchy of important (win/loss) variables. A total of 152 variables (79 absolute and 73 differentials) were used from the 2013-2018 Australian Football League (AFL) seasons. Various ML models were trained (cross-validation) on the 2013-2017 seasons with the-2018 season used as an independent test set. Model performance varied (66.5-73.3% test set accuracy), although the best model (glmnet-73.3%) rivalled bookmaker predictions in the same period (70.9%). The glmnet model revealed measures of team quality (a player-based rating and a team-based) in their relative form as the most important variables for prediction. Models that contained in-built feature selection or could model non-linear relationships generally performed better. These findings show that AFL game outcomes can be predicted using ML methods and provide a hierarchy of predictors that maximize the chance of winning.",60031806,University of Western Australia,Perth,Australia,['1700'],22.0,0.1048654244306418,0.4156314699792961,0,0.10486891385767791,0.056179775280898875,0.4641350210970464

In addition to modeling gaze and captions, we also explicitly model the personality of the users providing these samples. We incorporate constraints that encourage gaze and caption samples on the same image to be close in a learned space; we refer to this as content modeling. We also model style: we encourage samples provided by the same user to be close in a separate embedding space, regardless of the image on which they were provided. To leverage the complementary information that content and style constraints provide, we combine the embeddings from both networks.

Therefore, the degree of a model's generalization ability for recognizing unseen images is highly constrained by that of image features and attributes. In this paper, we discuss two questions about generalization that are seldom discussed. Are image features trained with samples of seen classes expressive enough to capture the discriminative information for both seen and unseen classes? Is the relationship learned from seen image features and attributes sufficiently generalized to recognize unseen classes. To answer these two questions, we propose a model to learn discriminative and generalizable representations from image features under an auto-encoder framework. The discriminative latent features are learned through a group-wise disentanglement over feature groups with a hierarchical structure.

Our results demonstrate that these innovations improve the modeling of long-term motion trajectories.

The study incorporated lycopene, as an additive compound into the formulated VCO-based LLC (V-L) with varying percentages of lycopene in VCO phase prior to mixing all the ingredients in a desired composition. The purpose of this study was to determine the best V-L system for use as a platform that can accommodate optimum lycopene. Physicochemical characterisation of the systems was performed by optical polarising microscopy (OPM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and rheological profile analysis. The OPM and SAXS results showed that both systems were capable of accommodating lycopene up to 70 wt%. Optical polarising microscope study showed that the lamellar texture of both systems remained even in the presence of lycopene up to 70 wt%, without any changes in the mesophases. The textures consist of striated, maltese cross and oily streak and the sharpest and clearest texture was exhibited by the Brij30/H2O/VCO system. The formation of lamella structures was also supported from the SAXS analysis where two recurring scattering peaks of scattering peak 1 and peak 2 for first derivation were observed in the SAXS spectrum of all the samples studied with a value of d < 56.38 √Ö. Rheological study showed that lamellar structure of Brij 30 system was much stronger than the Tween 60: Brij 30 system. The addition of 30 wt% of lycopene content to the Brij 30 system resulted in the lamellar structure with the strongest network and the most stable internal structure.

In this paper, we propose a randomized diversification as a defense strategy. We introduce a multi-channel architecture in a gray-box scenario, which assumes that the architecture of the classifier and the training data set are known to the attacker. The attacker does not only have access to a secret key and to the internal states of the system at the test time. The defender processes an input in multiple channels. Each channel introduces its own randomization in a special transform domain based on a secret key shared between the training and testing stages. Such a transform based randomization with a shared key preserves the gradients in key-defined sub-spaces for the defender but it prevents gradient back propagation and the creation of various bypass systems for the attacker. An additional benefit of multi-channel randomization is the aggregation that fuses soft-outputs from all channels, thus increasing the reliability of the final score. The sharing of a secret key creates an information advantage to the defender.

From a visual perspective, every instruction step can be seen as a way to change the visual appearance of the dish by adding extra objects (e.g., adding an ingredient) or changing the appearance of the existing ones (e.g., cooking the dish). In this paper, we aim to teach a machine how to make a pizza by building a generative model that mirrors this step-by-step procedure. To do so, we learn composable module operations which are able to either add or remove a particular ingredient. Each operator is designed as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Given only weak image-level supervision, the operators are trained to generate a visual layer that needs to be added to or removed from the existing image. The proposed model is able to decompose an image into an ordered sequence of layers by applying sequentially in the right order the corresponding removing modules. Experimental results on synthetic and real pizza images demonstrate that our proposed model is able to: (1) segment pizza toppings in a weakly-supervised fashion, (2) remove them by revealing what is occluded underneath them (i.e., inpainting), and (3) infer the ordering of the toppings without any depth ordering supervision.

66,67,67,Radial distortion triangulation,"This paper presents the first optimal, maximal likelihood, solution to the triangulation problem for radially distorted cameras. The proposed solution to the two-view triangulation problem minimizes the L2-norm of the reprojection error in the distorted image space. We cast the problem as the search for corrected distorted image points, and we use a Lagrange multiplier formulation to impose the epipolar constraint for undistorted points. For the one-parameter division model, this formulation leads to a system of five quartic polynomial equations in five unknowns, which can be exactly solved using the Groebner basis method. While the proposed Groebner basis solution is provably optimal; it is too slow for practical applications. Therefore, we developed a fast iterative solver to this problem. Extensive empirical tests show that the iterative algorithm delivers the optimal solution virtually every time, thus making it an L2-optimal algorithm de facto. It is iterative in nature, yet in practice, it converges in no more than five iterations. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world data, and we show the benefits of performing the triangulation in the distorted space in the presence of radial distortion.",60025858,ETH Z√ºrich,"Zurich ZH,",Switzerland,"['1712', '1707']",21.0,0.04375,0.35208333333333336,1,0.10232558139534884,0.027906976744186046,0.2822966507177033
67,68,68,Text sentiment analysis using frequency-based vigorous features,"Sentiment Analysis, an un-abating research area in text mining, requires a computational method for extracting useful information from text. In recent days, social media has become a really rich source to get information about the behavioral state of people (opinion) through reviews and comments. Numerous techniques have been aimed to analyze the sentiment of the text, however, they were unable to come up to the complexity of the sentiments. The complexity requires novel approach for deep analysis of sentiments for more accurate prediction. This research presents a three-step Sentiment Analysis and Prediction (SAP) solution of Text Trend through K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). At first, sentences are transformed into tokens and stop words are removed. Secondly, polarity of the sentence, paragraph and text is calculated through contributing weighted words, intensity clauses and sentiment shifters. The resulting features extracted in this step played significant role to improve the results. Finally, the trend of the input text has been predicted using KNN classifier based on extracted features. The training and testing of the model has been performed on publically available datasets of twitter and movie reviews.

69,70,70,Signal-to-noise ratio: A robust distance metric for deep metric learning,"Deep metric learning, which learns discriminative features to process image clustering and retrieval tasks, has attracted extensive attention in recent years. A number of deep metric learning methods, which ensure that similar examples are mapped close to each other and dissimilar examples are mapped farther apart, have been proposed to construct effective structures for loss functions and have shown promising results. In this paper, different from the approaches on learning the loss structures, we propose a robust SNR distance metric based on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for measuring the similarity of image pairs for deep metric learning. By exploring the properties of our SNR distance metric from the view of geometry space and statistical theory, we analyze the properties of our metric and show that it can preserve the semantic similarity between image pairs, which well justify its suitability for deep metric learning. Compared with Euclidean distance metric, our SNR distance metric can further jointly reduce the intra-class distances and enlarge the inter-class distances for learned features. Leveraging our SNR distance metric, we propose Deep SNR-based Metric Learning (DSML) to generate discriminative feature embeddings. By extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks, including CARS196, CUB200-2011 and CIFAR10, our DSML has shown its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods.

Our method can learn the spatiotemporal representation of the video by predicting the order of shuffled clips from the video. The category of the video is not required, which gives our technique the potential to take advantage of infinite unannotated videos. There exist related works which use frames, while compared to frames, clips are more consistent with the video dynamics. Clips can help to reduce the uncertainty of orders and are more appropriate to learn a video representation. The 3D convolutional neural networks are utilized to extract features for clips, and these features are processed to predict the actual order. The learned representations are evaluated via nearest neighbor retrieval experiments. We also use the learned networks as the pre-trained models and finetune them on the action recognition task.

One type of such technologies-the application area of the thesis presented here-is health and wellbeing technology (HWT), such as digital health records, physical activity trackers, or digital fitness coach applications. Researchers and companies alike often claim that HWTs empower people to live healthier and happier lives. However, there is reason to challenge and critically reflect on these claims and underlying assumptions as more and more researchers are finding that technologies described as empowering turn out to be ""disempowering"". This critical reflection is the starting point of the thesis presented here: Can HWTs really empower people in their everyday lives? If so, how can we design for empowerment? In my cumulative dissertation, I combine studies on existing HWTs, such as patient-controlled electronic health records and personalized mobile fitness coaches with the development of novel prototypes such as transparent digital fitness coaches that communicate their rationale to the user. By reflecting on these case studies, I come to revisit the sometimes washed-out meaning of ""empowerment"" in ""empowering technologies""; I introduce a framework to establish conceptual clarity; and I suggest three principles to design for empowerment based on my own work and the Capability Approach by Sen and Nussbaum that aim to inform and inspire research on HWTs and beyond.",60028717,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen,Munich,Germany,['1700'],40.0,0.09138755980861243,0.481203007518797,1,0.1510791366906475,0.017985611510791366,0.30597014925373134
76,78,78,GPSFM: Global projective sfm using algebraic constraints on multi-view fundamental matrices,"This paper addresses the problem of recovering projective camera matrices from collections of fundamental matrices in multiview settings. We make two main contributions. First, given {n choose 2} fundamental matrices computed for n images, we provide a complete algebraic characterization in the form of conditions that are both necessary and sufficient to enabling the recovery of camera matrices. These conditions are based on arranging the fundamental matrices as blocks in a single matrix, called the n-view fundamental matrix, and characterizing this matrix in terms of the signs of its eigenvalues and rank structures. Secondly, we propose a concrete algorithm for projective structure-from-motion that utilizes this characterization. Given a complete or partial collection of measured fundamental matrices, our method seeks camera matrices that minimize a global algebraic error for the measured fundamental matrices. In contrast to existing methods, our optimization, without any initialization, produces a consistent set of fundamental matrices that corresponds to a unique set of cameras (up to a choice of projective frame).

77,79,79,Mixture density generative adversarial networks,"Generative Adversarial Networks have a surprising ability to generate sharp and realistic images, but they are known to suffer from the so-called mode collapse problem. In this paper, we propose a new GAN variant called Mixture Density GAN that overcomes this problem by encouraging the Discriminator to form clusters in its embedding space, which in turn leads the Generator to exploit these and discover different modes in the data. This is achieved by positioning Gaussian density functions in the corners of a simplex, using the resulting Gaussian mixture as a likelihood function over discriminator embeddings, and formulating an objective function for GAN training that is based on these likelihoods. We show how formation of these clusters changes the probability landscape of the discriminator and improves the mode discovery of the GAN. We also show that the optimum of our training objective is attained if and only if the generated and the real distribution match exactly. We support our theoretical results with empirical evaluations on three mode discovery benchmark datasets (Stacked-MNIST, Ring of Gaussians and Grid of Gaussians), and four image datasets (CIFAR-10, CelebA, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST).

It is discovered that, for a large-scale FSL problem with 1,000 classes in the source domain, a strong baseline emerges, that is, simply training a deep feature embedding model using the aggregated source classes and performing nearest neighbor (NN) search using the learned features on the target classes. The state-of-the-art large-scale FSL methods struggle to beat this baseline, indicating intrinsic limitations on scalability. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel large-scale FSL model by learning transferable visual features with the class hierarchy which encodes the semantic relations between source and target classes.

Two types of state-of-art schemes address this issue via enriching knowledge. Cross-domain recommendation schemes transfer knowledge from another dense domain, but they only explore a single kind of shared knowledge. Recommendation schemes built on heterogeneous information networks (HIN) utilize knowledge implied in meta-paths connecting various objects, these methods, however, investigate meta-paths in a single domain. To improve recom-mendation performance in a highly sparse scenario, we propose a HIN Embedding based Cross-domain Recommendation (HecRec) framework, which exploits cross-domain information by establishing meta-path based HIN embeddings in both the source and the target domain and conducts personalized recommendation by integrating the obtained HIN embeddings with a rating predictor. To make the best use of cross-domain information and avoid the knowledge confliction between knowledge from different metapaths observed in real-system datasets, we adopt a concept of 'overpass bridge' to integrate the HIN embeddings drawn via different meta-paths. Experiments on two public datasets, i.e., MovieLens and LibraryThing, demonstrate the capacity of HecRec on addressing data sparseness.

All rights reserved.The Sultan Azlan Shah Campus (KSAS) of UniversitiPendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI), TanjongMalim, Perak, Malaysia, located at the foot of the Titiwangsa mountain range, has preserved a wide variety of tree species. Here we aim to identify the importance value index of the flora found on this campus. This study used a strip transect method with three transects of 300 m and 15 subplots of 4,500 m2. The study recorded 868 individual trees from 13 families, 23 genera, and 53 species. The highest importance value index at the family level was found to be the Myrtaceae (53.46%), at the genus level it was Syzygium (44.46%), and at the species level, it was Ploiariumalternifolium (24.23%). The study found that the secondary forest in the KSAS green belt is composed of indigenous species, as well as the species Ploiariumalternofolium, registered in the IUCN Red List.

It can robustly capture the high-level interactions between language and vision domains, thus significantly improves the performance of visual question answering. We also show that, the proposed dynamic intra modality attention flow conditioned on the other modality can dynamically modulate the intra-modality attention of the current modality, which is vital for multimodality feature fusion.

87,89,89,PointCONV: Deep convolutional networks on 3D point clouds,"Unlike images which are represented in regular dense grids, 3D point clouds are irregular and unordered, hence applying convolution on them can be difficult. In this paper, we extend the dynamic filter to a new convolution operation, named PointConv. PointConv can be applied on point clouds to build deep convolutional networks. We treat convolution kernels as nonlinear functions of the local coordinates of 3D points comprised of weight and density functions. With respect to a given point, the weight functions are learned with multi-layer perceptron networks and the density functions through kernel density estimation. A novel reformulation is proposed for efficiently computing the weight functions, which allowed us to dramatically scale up the network and significantly improve its performance. The learned convolution kernel can be used to compute translation-invariant and permutation-invariant convolution on any point set in the 3D space. Besides, PointConv can also be used as deconvolution operators to propagate features from a subsampled point cloud back to its original resolution. Experiments on ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanNet show that deep convolutional neural networks built on PointConv are able to achieve state-of-the-art on challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks on 3D point clouds. Besides, our experiments converting CIFAR-10 into a point cloud showed that networks built on PointConv can match the performance of convolutional networks in 2D images of a similar structure.",60013402,Oregon State University,Corvallis,United States,"['1712', '1707']",22.0,0.10664335664335664,0.4729334767796306,1,0.1349206349206349,0.031746031746031744,0.32916666666666666
88,90,90,An attention ensemble based approach for multilabel profanity detection,"The amount of user-generated content in the cyberspace keeps increasing in the 21st century. However, it has also meant an increase in the number of cyber abuse and bullying incidents being reported. Use of profane text by individuals threatens the liberty and integrity of the digital space. Manual moderation and reporting mechanisms have been traditionally used to keep a check on such profane text. Dependency on human interpretation and delay in results have been the biggest obstacles in this system. Previous deep learning-based approaches to automate the process have involved use of traditional convolution and recurrence based sequential models. However, these models tend to be computationally expensive and have higher memory requirement. Further, they tend to produce state of the art results in binary classification but perform relatively poorly on multilabel tasks, owing to less flexibility in architecture. In today's world, classifying text in a binary way is no longer sufficient and thus a flexible solution able to generalize well on multilabel text is the need of the hour. In this paper, we propose a multihead attention-based approach for detection of profane text. We couple our model with power weighted average ensembling techniques to further improve the performance. The proposed approach does not have additional memory requirement and is less complex as compared to previous approaches. The improved results obtained by our model on publicly available real-world data further validate the same.

89,91,91,What's to know? uncertainty as a guide to asking goal-oriented questions,"One of the core challenges in Visual Dialogue problems is asking the question that will provide the most useful information towards achieving the required objective. Encouraging an agent to ask the right questions is difficult because we don't know a-priori what information the agent will need to achieve its task, and we don't have an explicit model of what it knows already. We propose a solution to this problem based on a Bayesian model of the uncertainty in the implicit model maintained by the visual dialogue agent, and in the function used to select an appropriate output. By selecting the question that minimises the predicted regret with respect to this implicit model the agent actively reduces ambiguity. The Bayesian model of uncertainty also enables a principled method for identifying when enough information has been acquired, and an action should be selected. We evaluate our approach on two goal-oriented dialogue datasets, one for visual-based collaboration task and the other for a negotiation-based task.

90,92,92,Parametric noise injection: Trainable randomness to improve deep neural network robustness against adversarial attack,"Recent developments in the field of Deep Learning have exposed the underlying vulnerability of Deep Neural Network (DNN) against adversarial examples. In image classification, an adversarial example is a carefully modified image that is visually imperceptible to the original image but can cause DNN model to misclassify it. Training the network with Gaussian noise is an effective technique to perform model regularization, thus improving model robustness against input variation. Inspired by this classical method, we explore to utilize the regularization characteristic of noise injection to improve DNN's robustness against adversarial attack. In this work, we propose Parametric-Noise-Injection (PNI) which involves trainable Gaussian noise injection at each layer on either activation or weights through solving the Min-Max optimization problem, embedded with adversarial training. These parameters are trained explicitly to achieve improved robustness. The extensive results show that our proposed PNI technique effectively improves the robustness against a variety of powerful white-box and black-box attacks such as PGD, C&W, FGSM, transferable attack, and ZOO attack. Last but not the least, PNI method improves both clean-and perturbed-data accuracy, in comparison to the state-of-the-art defense methods, which outperforms current unbroken PGD defense by 1.1% and 6.8% on clean-and perturbed-test data respectively, using ResNet-20 architecture.",60022144,University of Central Florida,Orlando,United States,"['1712', '1707']",25.0,0.07107843137254903,0.4627450980392157,1,0.10714285714285714,0.08333333333333333,0.3652173913043478

Our method is weakly supervised and only requires silhouette annotations from unoccluded, category-specific objects. Our method does not require access to the object's 3D shape, multiple observations per object from different views, intra-image pixel correspondences, or any view annotations. Key to our method is a novel multi-projection generative adversarial network (MP-GAN) that trains a 3D shape generator to be consistent with multiple 2D projections of the 3D shapes, and without direct access to these 3D shapes. This is achieved through multiple discriminators that encode the distribution of 2D projections of the 3D shapes seen from a different views. Additionally, to determine the view information for each silhouette image, we also train a view prediction network on visualizations of 3D shapes synthesized by the generator. We iteratively alternate between training the generator and training the view prediction network. We validate our multi-projection GAN on both synthetic and real image datasets.

98,100,100,Recursive visual attention in visual dialog,"Visual dialog is a challenging vision-language task, which requires the agent to answer multi-round questions about an image. It typically needs to address two major problems: (1) How to answer visually-grounded questions, which is the core challenge in visual question answering (VQA); (2) How to infer the co-reference between questions and the dialog history. An example of visual co-reference is: Pronouns (e.g., 'they') in the question (e.g., 'Are they on or off?') are linked with nouns (e.g., 'lamps') appearing in the dialog history (e.g., 'How many lamps are there?') and the object grounded in the image. In this work, to resolve the visual co-reference for visual dialog, we propose a novel attention mechanism called Recursive Visual Attention (RvA). Specifically, our dialog agent browses the dialog history until the agent has sufficient confidence in the visual co-reference resolution, and refines the visual attention recursively. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the large-scale VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets demonstrate that the proposed RvA not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, but also achieves reasonable recursion and interpretable attention maps without additional annotations.

The paper also introduces Clustering Augmented Learning Method (CALM) which is based on concept of simultaneous heterogeneous clustering and regression learning to learn deep feature representations of spatio-temporal data obtained using the proposed embedding. The regression model that is considered in this work has a Feedforward Neural Net(FNN) architecture. With the aim of improving the accuracy of the regression model, CALM iterates between clustering and learning to form robust clusters, thereby leveraging the learning process of the FNN. A dissimilarity measure is proposed based on the weights of each feature of input data in the regression model to form the clusters. During each iteration of learning and clustering, a classifier is used to predict the current cluster labels, and the cluster belonging probabilities are used to control the subsequent re-estimation of cluster centers. Computational experiments on San Francisco Parking data set reveals that proposed approach CALM outperforms other baseline methods including multi-layer LSTM and Lasso with testing MAPE of 7.8% when predicting block-level parking occupancies.

102,104,104,Scale-adaptive neural dense features: Learning via hierarchical context aggregation,"How do computers and intelligent agents view the world around them? Feature extraction and representation constitutes one the basic building blocks towards answering this question. Traditionally, this has been done with carefully engineered hand-crafted techniques such as HOG, SIFT or ORB. However, there is no 'one size fits all' approach that satisfies all requirements. In recent years, the rising popularity of deep learning has resulted in a myriad of end-to-end solutions to many computer vision problems. These approaches, while successful, tend to lack scalability and can't easily exploit information learned by other systems. Instead, we propose SAND features, a dedicated deep learning solution to feature extraction capable of providing hierarchical context information. This is achieved by employing sparse relative labels indicating relationships or similarity of dissimilarity between image locations. The nature of these labels results in an almost infinite set of dissimilar examples to choose from. We demonstrate how the selection of negative examples during training can be used to modify the feature space and vary it's learned properties. To demonstrate the generality of this approach, we apply the proposed features to a multitude of tasks, each requiring different properties. This includes disparity estimation, semantic segmentation, self-localisation and SLAM.

103,105,105,Training deep learning based image denoisers from undersampled measurements without ground truth and without image prior,"Compressive sensing is a method to recover the original image from undersampled measurements. In order to overcome the ill-posedness of this inverse problem, image priors are used such as sparsity, minimal total-variation, or self-similarity of images. Recently, deep learning based compressive image recovery methods have been proposed and have yielded state-of-the-art performances. They used data-driven approaches instead of hand-crafted image priors to regularize ill-posed inverse problems with undersampled data. Ironically, training deep neural networks (DNNs) for them requires 'clean' ground truth images, but obtaining the best quality images from undersampled data requires well-trained DNNs. To resolve this dilemma, we propose novel methods based on two well-grounded theories: denoiser-approximate message passing (D-AMP) and Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE). Our proposed methods were able to train deep learning based image denoisers from undersampled measurements without ground truth images and without additional image priors, and to recover images with state-of-the-art qualities from undersampled data.

Our aim was to tackle this limitation by developing a new model based on deep learning which takes into account the area inside as well as outside the region of interest as well as the size of boundaries during learning. Specically, we propose a new loss function which incorporates area and size information and integrates this into a dense deep learning model.

Unfortunately, there is still enormous performance gap between artificial vision systems and human intelligence in terms of higher-level vision problems, especially ones involving reasoning. Earlier attempts in equipping machines with high-level reasoning have hovered around Visual Question Answering (VQA), one typical task associating vision and language understanding. In this work, we propose a new dataset, built in the context of Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and aimed at lifting machine intelligence by associating vision with structural, relational, and analogical reasoning in a hierarchical representation. Unlike previous works in measuring abstract reasoning using RPM, we establish a semantic link between vision and reasoning by providing structure representation. This addition enables a new type of abstract reasoning by jointly operating on the structure representation. Machine reasoning ability using modern computer vision is evaluated in this newly proposed dataset. Additionally, we also provide human performance as a reference.

Image-based localization has the advantage of being inexpensive and efficient, often avoiding the use of 3D metric maps altogether. That said, the need to maintain a large amount of reference images as an effective support of localization in a scene, nonetheless calls for them to be organized in a map structure of some kind. The problem of localization often arises as part of a navigation process. We are, therefore, interested in summarizing the reference images as a set of landmarks, which meet the requirements for image-based navigation. A contribution of this paper is to formulate such a set of requirements for the two sub-tasks involved: compact map construction and accurate self localization. These requirements are then exploited for compact map representation and accurate self-localization, using the framework of a network flow problem. During this process, we formulate the map construction and self-localization problems as convex quadratic and second-order cone programs, respectively.

While there are a number of studies on weakly supervised image classification, they usually limited to either single-label or multi-label scenarios. In this work, we propose an effective approach for weakly supervised image classification utilizing massive noisy labeled data with only a small set of clean labels (e.g., 5%). The proposed approach consists of a clean net and a residual net, which aim to learn a mapping from feature space to clean label space and a residual mapping from feature space to the residual between clean labels and noisy labels, respectively, in a multi-task learning manner. Thus, the residual net works as a regularization term to improve the clean net training. We evaluate the proposed approach on two multi-label datasets (OpenImage and MS COCO2014) and a single-label dataset (Clothing1M).

Motivated by the fact that human-designed networks are elegant in topology with a fast inference speed, we propose a mirror stimuli function inspired by biological cognition theory to extract the abstract topological knowledge of an expert human-design network (ResNeXt). To avoid raising a too strong prior over the search space, we introduce inverse reinforcement learning to train the mirror stimuli function and exploit it as a heuristic guidance for architecture search, easily generalized to different architecture search algorithms.

Among the most common ways to deal with such limitations is to rely on burst photography, which nowadays acts as the backbone of all modern smartphone imaging applications. In this work, we focus on the fact that every frame of a burst sequence can be accurately described by a forward (physical) model. This, in turn, allows us to restore a single image of higher quality from a sequence of low-quality images as the solution of an optimization problem. Inspired by an extension of the gradient descent method that can handle non-smooth functions, namely the proximal gradient descent, and modern deep learning techniques, we propose a convolutional iterative network with a transparent architecture. Our network uses a burst of low-quality image frames and is able to produce an output of higher image quality recovering fine details which are not distinguishable in any of the original burst frames. We focus both on the burst photography pipeline as a whole, i.e., burst demosaicking and denoising, as well as on the traditional Gaussian denoising task.

A large body of research addressing this problem exists in the literature. However, an interesting variant is not just to identify the gesture, but to decide whether a certain gesture is correctly or incorrectly executed. This can be in the context of physical exercises for rehabilitation in healthcare, robotics, sports, sign language and more. In this work we present our research on the automatic classification of gestures into correct or incorrect categories using the following three different but powerful techniques: convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and a technique based on rough path theory to extract unique sequences (i.e. path signatures) from gesture data and to use them as inputs to classical classifiers such as RandomForest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). We collected the data we used as part of a collaborative project from Perkeso Tun Razak Rehabilitation Centre, Malacca, Malaysia. We recorded 17 patients performing nine types of gestures. For controls, we recorded 14 healthy individuals performing the same gestures. Our cross subject evaluation yields high accuracy for several subjects and gestures. CNNs and LSTMs achieve accuracy values up to 100% for several subjects in many gestures with the highest average accuracy for some gestures reaching 92%. The best overall classifier when using the rough paths representation was kNN as its average accuracy can reach 96.74% (100% accuracy for a subset of subjects in some gestures).

However, existing deep GCP networks compute covariance pooling of convolutional activations with assumption that activations are sampled from Gaussian distributions, which may not hold in practice and fails to fully characterize the statistics of activations. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a novel deep global generalized Gaussian network (3G-Net), whose core is to estimate a global covariance of generalized Gaussian for modeling the last convolutional activations. Compared with GCP in Gaussian setting, our 3G-Net assumes the distribution of activations follows a generalized Gaussian, which can capture more precise characteristics of activations. However, there exists no analytic solution for parameter estimation of generalized Gaussian, making our 3G-Net challenging. To this end, we first present a novel regularized maximum likelihood estimator for robust estimating covariance of generalized Gaussian, which can be optimized by a modified iterative re-weighted method. Then, to efficiently estimate the covariance of generaized Gaussian under deep CNN architectures, we approximate this re-weighted method by developing an unrolling re-weighted module and a square root covariance layer. In this way, 3GNet can be flexibly trained in an end-to-end manner.

Most existing approaches handle this problem by first detecting event proposals from a video and then captioning on a subset of the proposals. As a result, the generated sentences are prone to be redundant or inconsistent since they fail to consider temporal dependency between events. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel dense video captioning framework, which models temporal dependency across events in a video explicitly and leverages visual and linguistic context from prior events for coherent storytelling. This objective is achieved by 1) integrating an event sequence generation network to select a sequence of event proposals adaptively, and 2) feeding the sequence of event proposals to our sequential video captioning network, which is trained by reinforcement learning with two-level rewards-at both event and episode levels-for better context modeling.

It raises a brand new challenge of overlapping image data, meanwhile shares the same properties with existing datasets, including complex yet meaningless contexts and class imbalance. We propose an approach named class-balanced hierarchical refinement (CHR) to deal with these difficulties. CHR assumes that each input image is sampled from a mixture distribution, and that deep networks require an iterative process to infer image contents accurately. To accelerate, we insert reversed connections to different network backbones, delivering high-level visual cues to assist mid-level features. In addition, a class-balanced loss function is designed to maximally alleviate the noise introduced by easy negative samples. We evaluate CHR on SIXray with different ratios of positive/negative samples. Compared to the baselines, CHR enjoys a better ability of discriminating objects especially using mid-level features, which offers the possibility of using a weakly-supervised approach towards accurate object localization. In particular, the advantage of CHR is more significant in the scenarios with fewer positive training samples, which demonstrates its potential application in real-world security inspection.",60119391,Huawei Noah's Ark Lab,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,"['1712', '1707']",20.8,0.10183982683982684,0.5158730158730159,1,0.1484375,0.0390625,0.4358974358974359

We provide empirical evidence to show that our deep RNN framework is easy to optimize and can gain accuracy from the increased depth on several visual sequence problems. On these tasks, we evaluate our deep RNN framework with 15 layers, 7√ó than conventional RNN networks, but it is still easy to train.

Here the hybrid nanofluid is considered as the working fluid, with different kinds of small particles in nanoscale being suspended. Design/methodology/approach: The generalized homogenous model is introduced to describe the behaviors of hybrid nanofluid. Within the framework of the boundary layer approximations, the governing equations embodying the conservation equations of total mass, momentum and thermal energy are reduced to a set of fully coupled ordinary differential equations via relevant scaling transformations. A flow stability analysis is performed to examine the behavior of convective heat energy. Accurate solutions are obtained by means of a very efficient homotopy-based package BVPh 2.0. Findings: Results show that the linear correlations of physical quantities among the base fluid and its suspended nanoparticles are adequate to give accurate results for simulation of behaviors of hybrid nanofluids. Heat enhancement can be also fulfilled by hybrid nanofluids. A flow stability analysis suggests the heat-related power index m > ‚àí1/3 for satisfying the increasing behavior of convective heat energy. Originality/value: Free convection of a hybrid nanofluid near a vertical flat surface embedded in a saturated porous medium with anisotropic permeability is investigated for the first time. The simplified hybrid nanofluid model is proposed for describing nanofluid behaviors. The results of this proposed approach agree well with those given by the traditional hybrid nanofluid model and experiment.

The intersection of spatial remote sensing big data and artificial intelligence information technology is a new scientific research domain and major application area in automatic target recognition. We emphasize that research on artificial intelligence information technology needs to be conducted under the physical background of the interaction between electromagnetic waves and targets, i.e., physical intelligence, to develop microwave vision of information perception on the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot be recognized by human eyes.

Traditionally, illustrations are found by editors manually. Such a manual method is so inefficient that it hurts productivity. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an automatic illustration recommendation system, called SmartBot, which can understand articles automatically and assist editors to find appropriate illustrations. The whole system consists of two phases: the offline phase and the online phase. In the offline phase, we extract semantic features, including text features and deep features, for one specific image. In the online phase, we propose a two-stage recommendation model. The first stage focuses on fast retrieval with text features, and the second stage re-ranks retrieved candidates with the deep similarity scores to get the most appropriate illustrations. To verify the capability of our system, we use a real-world dataset to do our experiments.

128,130,130,Slim densepose: Thrifty learning from sparse annotations and motion cues,"DensePose supersedes traditional landmark detectors by densely mapping image pixels to body surface coordinates. This power, however, comes at a greatly increased annotation cost, as supervising the model requires to manually label hundreds of points per pose instance. In this work, we thus seek methods to significantly slim down the DensePose annotations, proposing more efficient data collection strategies. In particular, we demonstrate that if annotations are collected in video frames, their efficacy can be multiplied for free by using motion cues. To explore this idea, we introduce DensePose-Track, a dataset of videos where selected frames are annotated in the traditional DensePose manner. Then, building on geometric properties of the DensePose mapping, we use the video dynamic to propagate ground-truth annotations in time as well as to learn from Siamese equivariance constraints. Having performed exhaustive empirical evaluation of various data annotation and learning strategies, we demonstrate that doing so can deliver significantly improved pose estimation results over strong baselines. However, despite what is suggested by some recent works, we show that merely synthesizing motion patterns by applying geometric transformations to isolated frames is significantly less effective, and that motion cues help much more when they are extracted from videos.",60026851,University of Oxford,Oxford,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707']",24.75,0.1904320987654321,0.5299382716049383,1,0.16,0.02666666666666667,0.34841628959276016

Previous research has approached this problem via low-level signals to predict short time horizons, and has not addressed how to leverage key assets relied upon heavily by industry self-driving systems: (1) large 3D perception efforts which provide highly accurate 3D states of agents with rich attributes, and (2) detailed and accurate semantic maps of the environment (lanes, traffic lights, crosswalks, etc). We present a unified representation which encodes such high-level semantic information in a spatial grid, allowing the use of deep convolutional models to fuse complex scene context. This enables learning entity-entity and entity-environment interactions with simple, feed-forward computations in each timestep within an overall temporal model of an agent's behavior.

However, the execution of construction projects is subjected to several constraints and risks that limit their start or progression operations, which regularly have a significant negative impact on overall projects performance. Most research only considered the internal factors affecting the project performance and overlooked the external factors in spite of their importance. The aim of this research is to investigate the external factors effect on project performance. The literature is reviewed and found that most external factors can be represented by PESTLE factors. Consequently, this research provides a conceptual model for the PESTLE factors effect on project performance in terms of time, cost, and quality. External factors are unpredictable and may generate effects that cannot be easily remedied without significant losses; therefore, it‚Äôs more important to investigate their effects on construction project performance.

131,133,133,Visual query answering by entity-attribute graph matching and reasoning,"Visual Query Answering (VQA) is of great significance in offering people convenience: one can raise a question for details of objects, or high-level understanding about the scene, over an image. This paper proposes a novel method to address the VQA problem. In contrast to prior works, our method that targets single scene VQA, replies on graph-based techniques and involves reasoning. In a nutshell, our approach is centered on three graphs. The first graph, referred to as inference graph G I, is constructed via learning over labeled data. The other two graphs, referred to as query graph Q and entity-attribute graph EAG, are generated from natural language query NLQ and image Img, that are issued from users, respectively. As EAG often does not take sufficient information to answer Q, we develop techniques to infer missing information of EAG with G I. Based on EAG and Q, we provide techniques to find matches of Q in EAG, as the answer of NLQ in Img. Unlike commonly used VQA methods that are based on end-to-end neural networks, our graph-based method shows well-designed reasoning capability, and thus is highly interpretable. We also create a dataset on soccer match (Soccer-VQA) with rich annotations.

132,134,134,A decision support framework for autoML Systems: A meta-learning approach,"In general, the process of building a high-quality machine learning model is an iterative, complex and timeconsuming process that involves exploring the performance of various machine learning algorithms in addition to having a good understanding and experience with effectively tuning their hyper-parameters. In practice, conducting this process efficiently requires solid knowledge and experience with the various techniques that can be employed. With the continuous and vast increase of the amount of data in our digital world, it has been acknowledged that the number of knowledgeable data scientists can not scale to address these challenges. Thus, there is a crucial need for automating the process of Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter tuning (CASH) in the machine learning domain. Recently, several systems (e.g., AutoWeka, AutoSKLearn, SmartML) have been introduced to tackle this challenge with the main aim of reducing the role of human in the loop and filling the gap for non-expert machine learning users by playing the role of the data scientist. Meta-Learning is described as the process of learning from previous experience gained during applying various learning algorithms on different types of data, and hence reducing the needed time to learn new tasks. In the context of the Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) process, one main advantage of meta-learning techniques is that they allow hand-engineered algorithms to be replaced with novel automated methods which are designed in a data-driven way. In this paper, we present a methodology and framework for using Meta-Learning techniques to develop new methods that serve as an effective decision support for the AutoML process. In particular, we use Meta-Learning techniques to answer several crucial questions for the AutoML process including: 1) Which classifiers are expected to be the best performing on a given dataset? 2) Can we predict the training time of a classifier? 3) Which classifiers are worth investing a larger portion of the time budget to improve their performance by tuning them? In our Meta-Learning process, we used 200 datasets with different characteristics on a wide set of metafeatures. In addition, we used 30 classifiers from two popular machine learning libraries, namely, Weka and Scikit-learn. Our results and Meta-Models have been obtained in a fully automated way.

133,135,135,Prototype propagation clustering based on large margin,"The idea of the prototype is important in clustering analysis. The main idea of prototype clustering is representing clusters by the compact model in the form of a set of prototypes and using the prototypes to guide the assignment of instances in the data set. Based on the idea of prototype clustering, a number of clustering algorithms have been proposed. However, most of the prototype-based algorithms focus on discovering prototypes, while the assignment step is simply handled by assigning each instance to its nearest prototype. Due to the low representability for the instances being far away from any prototypes, the nearest neighbor method may bring many mistakes. To handle this problem, in this paper, we draw large margin theory into the assignment step and propose a prototype propagation clustering algorithm. which gradually assigns the instances to the clusters. During the assignment process, the prototypes, clusters and the margin of instances are dynamically updated to guarantee sufficient representability of an instance's prototype. Visible experiments on four two-dimensional data sets are conducted to show the working mechanism of the proposed assignment method. Experimental analyses on benchmark data sets illustrate the superior clustering performance of the proposed clustering algorithm comparing with other five representative algorithms.",60002222,Shanxi University,Taiyuan,China,"['1706', '1712']",20.2,0.17930402930402928,0.5053113553113554,1,0.13333333333333333,0.008888888888888889,0.2669683257918552

After a decade of active research, zero-shot learning (ZSL) models accuracy on the Imagenet benchmark remains far too low to be considered for practical object recognition applications. In this paper, we argue that the main reason behind this apparent lack of progress is the poor quality of this benchmark. We highlight major structural flaws of the current benchmark and analyze different factors impacting the accuracy of ZSL models. We show that the actual classification accuracy of existing ZSL models is significantly higher than was previously thought as we account for these flaws. We then introduce the notion of structural bias specific to ZSL datasets. We discuss how the presence of this new form of bias allows for a trivial solution to the standard benchmark and conclude on the need for a new benchmark.

138,140,140,Structured pruning of neural networks with budget-aware regularization,"Pruning methods have shown to be effective at reducing the size of deep neural networks while keeping accuracy almost intact. Among the most effective methods are those that prune a network while training it with a sparsity prior loss and learnable dropout parameters. A shortcoming of these approaches however is that neither the size nor the inference speed of the pruned network can be controlled directly; yet this is a key feature for targeting deployment of CNNs on low-power hardware. To overcome this, we introduce a budgeted regularized pruning framework for deep CNNs. Our approach naturally fits into traditional neural network training as it consists of a learnable masking layer, a novel budget-aware objective function, and the use of knowledge distillation. We also provide insights on how to prune a residual network and how this can lead to new architectures. Experimental results reveal that CNNs pruned with our method are more accurate and less compute-hungry than state-of-the-art methods. Also, our approach is more effective at preventing accuracy collapse in case of severe pruning; this allows pruning factors of up to 16x without significant accuracy drop.",60011832,Universit√© de Sherbrooke,Sherbrooke,Canada,"['1712', '1707']",23.125,0.2286682615629985,0.5147129186602871,1,0.10900473933649289,0.0,0.25125628140703515

This encoding allows deep neural networks to automatically learn intraclass and interclass relationships without any explicit modification of the network architecture. Our method converts data labels into soft probability distributions that pair well with common categorical loss functions such as cross-entropy.

Yet, one of the serious and well-known social issues is that although lots of modern people feel stressed and psychological anxiety in a workplace, home, etc., they are afraid of expressing their emotions. Hiding emotions or failing to release stress can cause more serious medical issues. For this reason, this research focused on developing the system of recognizing facial expressions to provide psychological diagnosis and treatment. In this research, we developed a facial recognition system for psychotherapy robots. The YCbCr color model was used for image pre-processing, and face detection was performed by the Haar-like feature.

142,144,144,Lending orientation to neural networks for cross-view geo-localization,"This paper studies image-based geo-localization (IBL) problem using ground-to-aerial cross-view matching. The goal is to predict the spatial location of a ground-level query image by matching it to a large geotagged aerial image database (e.g., satellite imagery). This is a challenging task due to the drastic differences in their viewpoints and visual appearances. Existing deep learning methods for this problem have been focused on maximizing feature similarity between spatially close-by image pairs, while minimizing other images pairs which are far apart. They do so by deep feature embedding based on visual appearance in those ground-and-aerial images. However, in everyday life, humans commonly use orientation information as an important cue for the task of spatial localization. Inspired by this insight, this paper proposes a novel method which endows deep neural networks with the 'commonsense' of orientation. Given a ground-level spherical panoramic image as query input (and a large georeferenced satellite image database), we design a Siamese network which explicitly encodes the orientation (i.e., spherical directions) of each pixel of the images. Our method significantly boosts the discriminative power of the learned deep features, leading to a much higher recall and precision outperforming all previous methods. Our network is also more compact using only 1/5th number of parameters than a previously best-performing network.

Considering that current methods are generally time-consuming due to the dense frame-processing manner, we propose a recurrent neural network based reinforcement learning model which selectively observes a sequence of frames and associates the given sentence with video content in a matching-based manner. However, directly matching sentences with video content performs poorly due to the large visual-semantic discrepancy. Thus, we extend the method to a semantic matching reinforcement learning (SM-RL) model by extracting semantic concepts of videos and then fusing them with global context features.

The strength of that function or the model depends directly on the features provided to the learning algorithm. Specifically, a crucial means of improving the model quality is to add new predictive features. This is often performed by domain specialists or data scientists.

147,149,149,DistillHash: Unsupervised deep hashing by distilling data pairs,"Due to storage and search efficiency, hashing has become significantly prevalent for nearest neighbor search. Particularly, deep hashing methods have greatly improved the search performance, typically under supervised scenarios. In contrast, unsupervised deep hashing models can hardly achieve satisfactory performance due to the lack of supervisory similarity signals. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a new deep unsupervised hashing model, called DistilHash, which can learn a distilled data set, where data pairs have confident similarity signals. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the initial but noisy similarity signals learned from local structures and the semantic similarity labels assigned by the optimal Bayesian classifier. We show that, under a mild assumption, some data pairs, of which labels are consistent with those assigned by the optimal Bayesian classifier, can be potentially distilled. With this understanding, we design a simple but effective method to distill data pairs automatically and further adopt a Bayesian learning framework to learn hashing functions from the distilled data set.

148,150,150,Marginalized latent semantic encoder for zero-shot learning,"Zero-shot learning has been well explored to precisely identify new unobserved classes through a visual-semantic function obtained from the existing objects. However, there exist two challenging obstacles: One is that the human-annotated semantics are insufficient to fully describe the visual samples; the other is the domain shift across existing and new classes. In this paper, we attempt to exploit the intrinsic relationship in the semantic manifold when given semantics are not enough to describe the visual objects, and enhance the generalization ability of the visual-semantic function with marginalized strategy. Specifically, we design a Marginalized Latent Semantic Encoder (MLSE), which is learned on the augmented seen visual features and the latent semantic representation. Meanwhile, latent semantics are discovered under an adaptive graph reconstruction scheme based on the provided semantics. Consequently, our proposed algorithm could enrich visual characteristics from seen classes, and well generalize to unobserved classes.

Given a single RGB image, our model jointly estimates the 3D hand and object poses, models their interactions, and recognizes the object and action classes with a single feed-forward pass through a neural network. We propose a single architecture that does not rely on external detection algorithms but rather is trained end-to-end on single images. We further merge and propagate information in the temporal domain to infer interactions between hand and object trajectories and recognize actions. The complete model takes as input a sequence of frames and outputs per-frame 3D hand and object pose predictions along with the estimates of object and action categories for the entire sequence.

150,152,152,Efficient decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on face recognition,"Face recognition has obtained remarkable progress in recent years due to the great improvement of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, deep CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can cause fateful consequences in real-world face recognition applications with security-sensitive purposes. Adversarial attacks are widely studied as they can identify the vulnerability of the models before they are deployed. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art face recognition models in the decision-based black-box attack setting, where the attackers have no access to the model parameters and gradients, but can only acquire hard-label predictions by sending queries to the target model. This attack setting is more practical in real-world face recognition systems. To improve the efficiency of previous methods, we propose an evolutionary attack algorithm, which can model the local geometry of the search directions and reduce the dimension of the search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that induces a minimum perturbation to an input face image with fewer queries. We also apply the proposed method to attack a real-world face recognition system successfully.",60114181,Tencent,Shenzhen,China,"['1712', '1707']",22.5,0.13630952380952382,0.4839285714285714,1,0.11059907834101383,0.004608294930875576,0.3147208121827411

In this paper, we go beyond the local detail representation by introducing context awareness to augment off-the-shelf local feature descriptors. Specifically, we propose a unified learning framework that leverages and aggregates the cross-modality contextual information, including (i) visual context from high-level image representation, and (ii) geometric context from 2D keypoint distribution. Moreover, we propose an effective N-pair loss that eschews the empirical hyper-parameter search and improves the convergence.

However, learning to learn the relation between people in an image, and inferring the most important person based on this relation, remains undeveloped. In this work, we propose a deep imPOrtance relatIon NeTwork (POINT) that combines both relation modeling and feature learning. In particular, we infer two types of interaction modules: The person-person interaction module that learns the interaction between people and the event-person interaction module that learns to describe how a person is involved in the event occurring in an image. We then estimate the importance relations among people from both interactions and encode the relation feature from the importance relations. In this way, POINT automatically learns several types of relation features in parallel, and we aggregate these relation features and the person's feature to form the importance feature for important people classification.

153,155,155,Frame-consistent recurrent video deraining with dual-level flow,"In this paper, we address the problem of rain removal from videos by proposing a more comprehensive framework that considers the additional degradation factors in real scenes neglected in previous works. The proposed framework is built upon a two-stage recurrent network with dual-level flow regularizations to perform the inverse recovery process of the rain synthesis model for video deraining. The rain-free frame is estimated from the single rain frame at the first stage. It is then taken as guidance along with previously recovered clean frames to help obtain a more accurate clean frame at the second stage. This two-step architecture is capable of extracting more reliable motion information from the initially estimated rain-free frame at the first stage for better frame alignment and motion modeling at the second stage. Furthermore, to keep the motion consistency between frames that facilitates a frame-consistent deraining model at the second stage, a dual-level flow based regularization is proposed at both coarse flow and fine pixel levels. To better train and evaluate the proposed video deraining network, a novel rain synthesis model is developed to produce more visually authentic paired training and evaluation videos.

Our approach is direct in the sense that a single pair of corresponding local patches already provides the necessary transformation cue for the global registration. To achieve that, we first endow the state of the art PPF-FoldNet auto-encoder (AE) with a pose-variant sibling, where the discrepancy between the two leads to pose-specific descriptors. Based upon this, we introduce RelativeNet, a relative pose estimation network to assign correspondence-specific orientations to the keypoints, eliminating any local reference frame computations. Finally, we devise a simple yet effective hypothesize-and-verify algorithm to quickly use the predictions and align two point sets.

155,157,157,APOLLOCAR3D: A large 3D car instance understanding benchmark for autonomous driving,"Autonomous driving has attracted remarkable attention from both industry and academia. An important task is to estimate 3D properties (e.g. translation, rotation and shape) of a moving or parked vehicle on the road. This task, while critical, is still under-researched in the computer vision community-partially owing to the lack of large scale and fully-annotated 3D car database suitable for autonomous driving research. In this paper, we contribute the first large scale database suitable for 3D car instance understanding-ApolloCar3D. The dataset contains 5,277 driving images and over 60K car instances, where each car is fitted with an industry-grade 3D CAD model with absolute model size and semantically labelled keypoints. This dataset is above 20√ó larger than PASCAL3D+ and KITTI, the current state-of-the-art. To enable efficient labelling in 3D, we build a pipeline by considering 2D-3D keypoint correspondences for a single instance and 3D relationship among multiple instances. Equipped with such dataset, we build various baseline algorithms with the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we first segment each car with a pre-trained Mask R-CNN, and then regress towards its 3D pose and shape based on a deformable 3D car model with or without using semantic keypoints. We show that using keypoints significantly improves fitting performance.

156,158,158,On stabilizing generative adversarial training with noise,"We present a novel method and analysis to train generative adversarial networks (GAN) in a stable manner. As shown in recent analysis, training is often undermined by the probability distribution of the data being zero on neighborhoods of the data space. We notice that the distributions of real and generated data should match even when they undergo the same filtering. Therefore, to address the limited support problem we propose to train GANs by using different filtered versions of the real and generated data distributions. In this way, filtering does not prevent the exact matching of the data distribution, while helping training by extending the support of both distributions. As filtering we consider adding samples from an arbitrary distribution to the data, which corresponds to a convolution of the data distribution with the arbitrary one. We also propose to learn the generation of these samples so as to challenge the discriminator in the adversarial training. We show that our approach results in a stable and well-behaved training of even the original minimax GAN formulation. Moreover, our technique can be incorporated in most modern GAN formulations and leads to a consistent improvement on several common datasets.",60020486,University of Bern,Bern,Switzerland,"['1712', '1707']",21.555555555555557,0.08772321428571428,0.3417410714285714,1,0.14084507042253522,0.014084507042253521,0.24170616113744076

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to estimate the illuminant chromaticity of AC light source using high-speed camera. We found that the temporal observations of an image pixel at a fixed location distribute on an identical dichromatic plane. Instead of spatial pixels with high specularity, multiple temporal samples of a pixel are exploited to determine AC pixels for dichromatic plane estimation, whose pixel intensity is sinusoidally varying well. A dichromatic plane is calculated per each AC pixel, and illuminant chromaticity is determined by the intersection of dichromatic planes. From multiple dichromatic planes, an optimal illuminant is estimated with a novel MAP framework. It is shown that the proposed method outperforms both existing dichromatic based methods and temporal color constancy methods, irrespective of the amount of specularity.",60005273,Korea University,Seoul,South Korea,"['1712', '1707']",20.571428571428573,0.07428571428571429,0.35428571428571426,1,0.11320754716981132,0.025157232704402517,0.3057324840764331

We empirically focus on the viability of two training methods: Self-critical Sequence Training (SCST) and Gumbel Straight-Through (ST) and demonstrate that SCST shows more stable gradient behavior and improved results over Gumbel ST, even without accessing discriminator gradients directly. We also address the problem of automatic evaluation for captioning models and introduce a new semantic score, and show its correlation to human judgement. As an evaluation paradigm, we argue that an important criterion for a captioner is the ability to generalize to compositions of objects that do not usually co-occur together. To this end, we introduce a small captioned Out of Context (OOC) test set. The OOC set, combined with our semantic score, are the proposed new diagnosis tools for the captioning community. When evaluated on OOC and MS-COCO benchmarks, we show that SCST-based training has a strong performance in both semantic score and human evaluation, promising to be a valuable new approach for efficient discrete GAN training.",60011048,IBM Research,Yorktown Heights,United States,"['1712', '1707']",26.714285714285715,0.15518648018648015,0.41899766899766894,1,0.11504424778761062,0.08849557522123894,0.37264150943396224
159,161,161,Customizable architecture search for semantic segmentation,"In this paper, we propose a Customizable Architecture Search (CAS) approach to automatically generate a network architecture for semantic image segmentation. The generated network consists of a sequence of stacked computation cells. A computation cell is represented as a directed acyclic graph, in which each node is a hidden representation (i.e., feature map) and each edge is associated with an operation (e.g., convolution and pooling), which transforms data to a new layer. During the training, the CAS algorithm explores the search space for an optimized computation cell to build a network. The cells of the same type share one architecture but with different weights. In real applications, however, an optimization may need to be conducted under some constraints such as GPU time and model size. To this end, a cost corresponding to the constraint will be assigned to each operation. When an operation is selected during the search, its associated cost will be added to the objective. As a result, our CAS is able to search an optimized architecture with customized constraints. The approach has been thoroughly evaluated on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, and demonstrates superior performance over several state-of-the-art techniques. More remarkably, our CAS achieves 72.3% mIoU on the Cityscapes dataset with speed of 108 FPS on an Nvidia TitanXp GPU.",60019118,University of Science and Technology of China,Hefei,China,"['1712', '1707']",19.272727272727273,0.2183080808080808,0.4323232323232323,1,0.10441767068273092,0.05220883534136546,0.3374485596707819

It is necessary to carefully preprocess Twitter data because it includes a considerable amount of noise. However, compared to other resources, such as government statistics and newspapers, Twitter provides varied information and is distinguished by its immediacy. We can also regard Twitter data as data that reflect human behaviors, thoughts, and intentions across different domains by characteristics of the platform.

Since people seldom express definite stance under rumors with unclear authenticity, it is difficult to judge such stances. Machine learning approaches have been proposed to address this problem with either manually designed features or automatically extracted features. However, the problem is related to many aspects of attributes and it is somehow difficult to summarize a comprehensive feature template or to learn an effective feature representation.

As the big data time comes, the size of database increases sharply. How to mine frequent patterns efficiently from big transaction databases is always a challenge. An approach to the issue is to parallelize the mining algorithm. However, traditional parallel algorithms have issues in balancing workloads and in recovering from failures. Thus, a novel MapReduce-based parallel algorithm is proposed with three contributions. First, a hybrid mining strategy is proposed, which automatically shifts from breadth-first mining to depth-first mining and performs breadth-first mining and depth-first mining simultaneously. Second, a hybrid vertical data format namely mixset is applied in breadth-first mining, and a new method for transforming a mixset back to a horizontal data representation is proposed which facilitates depth-first mining. Third, strategies are proposed to reduce the number of candidates in breadth-first mining and to facilitate depth-first mining that avoids generating candidates, which saves both space and time.

165,167,167,Photon-flooded single-photon 3D cameras,"Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are starting to play a pivotal role in the development of photon-efficient, long-range LiDAR systems. However, due to non-linearities in their image formation model, a high photon flux (e.g., due to strong sunlight) leads to distortion of the incident temporal waveform, and potentially, large depth errors. Operating SPADs in low flux regimes can mitigate these distortions, but, often requires attenuating the signal and thus, results in low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we address the following basic question: what is the optimal photon flux that a SPAD-based LiDAR should be operated in? We derive a closed form expression for the optimal flux, which is quasi-depth-invariant, and depends on the ambient light strength. The optimal flux is lower than what a SPAD typically measures in real world scenarios, but surprisingly, considerably higher than what is conventionally suggested for avoiding distortions. We propose a simple, adaptive approach for achieving the optimal flux by attenuating incident flux based on an estimate of ambient light strength. Using extensive simulations and a hardware prototype, we show that the optimal flux criterion holds for several depth estimators, under a wide range of illumination conditions.",60032179,University of Wisconsin-Madison,Madison,United States,"['1712', '1707']",27.42857142857143,0.08173160173160171,0.3829329004329004,1,0.10833333333333334,0.020833333333333332,0.32432432432432434
166,168,168,Data representation and learning with graph diffusion-embedding networks,"Recently, graph convolutional neural networks have been widely studied for graph-structured data representation and learning. In this paper, we present Graph Diffusion-Embedding networks (GDENs), a new model for graph-structured data representation and learning. GDENs are motivated by our development of graph based feature diffusion. GDENs integrate both feature diffusion and graph node (low-dimensional) embedding simultaneously into a unified network by employing a novel diffusion-embedding architecture. GDENs have two main advantages.

168,171,171,The alignment of the spheres: Globally-optimal spherical mixture alignment for camera pose estimation,"Determining the position and orientation of a calibrated camera from a single image with respect to a 3D model is an essential task for many applications. When 2D-3D correspondences can be obtained reliably, perspective-n-point solvers can be used to recover the camera pose. However, without the pose it is non-trivial to find cross-modality correspondences between 2D images and 3D models, particularly when the latter only contains geometric information. Consequently, the problem becomes one of estimating pose and correspondences jointly. Since outliers and local optima are so prevalent, robust objective functions and global search strategies are desirable. Hence, we cast the problem as a 2D-3D mixture model alignment task and propose the first globally-optimal solution to this formulation under the robust L2 distance between mixture distributions. We derive novel bounds on this objective function and employ branch-and-bound to search the 6D space of camera poses, guaranteeing global optimality without requiring a pose estimate. To accelerate convergence, we integrate local optimization, implement GPU bound computations, and provide an intuitive way to incorporate side information such as semantic labels. The algorithm is evaluated on challenging synthetic and real datasets, outperforming existing approaches and reliably converging to the global optimum.",60105232,ShanghaiTech University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1707']",21.777777777777782,0.12473544973544975,0.3100529100529101,1,0.13043478260869565,0.004347826086956522,0.32407407407407407
169,172,172,Evaluating carbon extremes in a coupled climate-carbon cycle simulation,"Gross primary production (GPP) measures the photosynthetic update of carbon by terrestrial ecosystems. Accurately quantifying and simulating GPP and its extremes remains a challenge in global carbon cycle sciences. Here, we evaluate GPP extremes in a coupled biogeochemistry (BGC) simulation by the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1.1) using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution statistical model. The simulation is evaluated against the Global Bio-Atmosphere Flux (GBAF) data. Temporal trends and ENSO dependence are also investigated by using GEV models where time and the Ni√±o3.4 index are introduced as linear covariates. The E3SMv1.1 model simulation generally predicts stronger negative and positive GPP extremes as compared to GBAF data. It also tends to simulate stronger temporal trends of GPP extremes than GBAF data. While negative GPP extreme trends are not significant in either E3SM or GBAF, positive GPP trends are statistically significant over several regions only for the E3SMv1.1 model simulation. ENSO dependence is generally stronger in the E3SMv1.1 model simulation, but ENSO dependence is found not to be significant for the time period analyzed (1980-2006) to match GBAF data. For the longer simulation period of 1900-2006, ENSO dependence is found to be statistically significant over Amazon, the maritime continent and Northern Australia for both negative and positive extremes.",60024266,Oak Ridge National Laboratory,Oak Ridge,United States,"['1706', '1712']",21.1,0.06224173553719008,0.5258953168044077,1,0.07755102040816327,0.16326530612244897,0.4351464435146444

However, few previous methods explored the problem of pose estimation in crowded scenes while it remains challenging and inevitable in many scenarios.

With multi-peak prediction for each joint and global association using the graph model, our method is robust to inevitable interference in crowded scenes and very efficient in inference.

The goal of the system is to minimize perceived visual artifacts of the message embedding, while simultaneously maximizing the accuracy of message recovery on the camera side. LFM requires photographic steganography for embedding messages that can be displayed and camera-captured. Unlike digital steganography, the embedding requirements are significantly more challenging due to the combined effect of the screen's radiometric emittance function, the camera's sensitivity function, and the camera-display relative geometry. We devise and train a network to jointly learn a deep embedding and recovery algorithm that requires no multi-frame synchronization. A key novel component is the camera display transfer function (CDTF) to model the camera-display pipeline. To learn this CDTF we introduce a dataset (Camera-Display 1M) of 1,000,000 camera-captured images collected from 25 camera-display pairs.

Experiments on benchmark image datasets (LFW, IJB-C and ImageNet-100) reveal that the intrinsic dimensionality of deep neural network representations is significantly lower than the dimensionality of the ambient features. For instance, SphereFace's 512-dim face representation and ResNet's 512-dim image representation have an intrinsic dimensionality of 16 and 19 respectively. Further, the DeepMDS mapping is able to obtain a representation of significantly lower dimensionality while maintaining discriminative ability to a large extent, 59.75% TAR@0.1% FAR in 16-dim vs 71.26% TAR in 512-dim on IJB-C and a Top-1 accuracy of 77.0% at 19-dim vs 83.4% at 512-dim on ImageNet-100.",60031707,Michigan State University,East Lansing,United States,"['1712', '1707']",38.5,0.06493506493506494,0.6185064935064936,1,0.07446808510638298,0.06914893617021277,0.4076086956521739
174,177,177,Efficient video classification using fewer frames,"Recently, there has been a lot of interest in building compact models for video classification which have a small memory footprint (<1 GB). While these models are compact, they typically operate by repeated application of a small weight matrix to all the frames in a video. For example, recurrent neural network based methods compute a hidden state for every frame of the video using a recurrent weight matrix. Similarly, cluster-and-aggregate based methods such as NetVLAD have a learnable clustering matrix which is used to assign soft-clusters to every frame in the video. Since these models look at every frame in the video, the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) is still large even though the memory footprint is small. In this work, we focus on building compute-efficient video classification models which process fewer frames and hence have less number of FLOPs. Similar to memory efficient models, we use the idea of distillation albeit in a different setting. Specifically, in our case, a compute-heavy teacher which looks at all the frames in the video is used to train a compute-efficient student which looks at only a small fraction of frames in the video. This is in contrast to a typical memory efficient Teacher-Student setting, wherein both the teacher and the student look at all the frames in the video but the student has fewer parameters. Our work thus complements the research on memory efficient video classification. We do an extensive evaluation with three types of models for video classification, viz., (i) recurrent models (ii) cluster-and-aggregate models and (iii) memory-efficient cluster-and-aggregate models and show that in each of these cases, a see-it-all teacher can be used to train a compute efficient see-very-little student. Overall, we show that the proposed student network can reduce the inference time by 30% and the number of FLOPs by approximately 90% with a negligent drop in the performance.",60076695,NVIDIA,Santa Clara,United States,"['1712', '1707']",25.91666666666667,-0.10291005291005292,0.4173280423280423,1,0.0835509138381201,0.018276762402088774,0.2885714285714286
175,178,178,Emotion-aware human attention prediction,"Despite the recent success in face recognition and object classification, in the field of human gaze prediction, computer models are still struggling to accurately mimic human attention. One main reason is that visual attention is a complex human behavior influenced by multiple factors, ranging from low-level features (e.g., color, contrast) to high-level human perception (e.g., objects interactions, object sentiment), making it difficult to model computationally. In this work, we investigate the relation between object sentiment and human attention. We first introduce a new evaluation metric (AttI) for measuring human attention that focuses on human fixation consensus. A series of empirical data analyses with AttI indicate that emotion-evoking objects receive attention favor, especially when they co-occur with emotionally-neutral objects, and this favor varies with different image complexity. Based on the empirical analyses, we design a deep neural network for human attention prediction which allows the attention bias on emotion-evoking objects to be encoded in its feature space. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance, especially on metrics that evaluate relative importance of salient regions. This research provides the clearest picture to date on how object sentiments influence human attention, and it makes one of the first attempts to model this phenomenon computationally.",60071464,De La Salle University-Manila,Manila,Philippines,"['1712', '1707']",25.375,0.05725108225108225,0.3120670995670996,1,0.11934156378600823,0.00823045267489712,0.2943722943722944

As the primary goal of the ConvNets is to characterize complex boundaries of thousands of classes in a high-dimensional space, it is critical to learn higher-order representations for enhancing non-linear modeling capability. Recently, Global Second-order Pooling (GSoP), plugged at the end of networks, has attracted increasing attentions, achieving much better performance than classical, first-order networks in a variety of vision tasks. However, how to effectively introduce higher-order representation in earlier layers for improving non-linear capability of ConvNets is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel network model introducing GSoP across from lower to higher layers for exploiting holistic image information throughout a network. Given an input 3D tensor outputted by some previous convolutional layer, we perform GSoP to obtain a covariance matrix which, after nonlinear transformation, is used for tensor scaling along channel dimension. Similarly, we can perform GSoP along spatial dimension for tensor scaling as well. In this way, we can make full use of the second-order statistics of the holistic image throughout a network.

As we witness the wide spread adoption of these systems, it is imperative to consider the problem of unintended leakage of information from an image representation, which might compromise the privacy of the data owner. This paper investigates the problem of learning an image representation that minimizes such leakage of user information. We formulate the problem as an adversarial non-zero sum game of finding a good embedding function with two competing goals: to retain as much task dependent discriminative image information as possible, while simultaneously minimizing the amount of information, as measured by entropy, about other sensitive attributes of the user. We analyze the stability and convergence dynamics of the proposed formulation using tools from non-linear systems theory and compare to that of the corresponding adversarial zero-sum game formulation that optimizes likelihood as a measure of information content.

179,182,182,Exploring object relation in mean teacher for cross-domain detection,"Rendering synthetic data (e.g., 3D CAD-rendered images) to generate annotations for learning deep models in vision tasks has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, simply applying the models learnt on synthetic images may lead to high generalization error on real images due to domain shift. To address this issue, recent progress in cross-domain recognition has featured the Mean Teacher, which directly simulates unsupervised domain adaptation as semi-supervised learning. The domain gap is thus naturally bridged with consistency regularization in a teacher-student scheme. In this work, we advance this Mean Teacher paradigm to be applicable for cross-domain detection. Specifically, we present Mean Teacher with Object Relations (MTOR) that novelly remolds Mean Teacher under the backbone of Faster R-CNN by integrating the object relations into the measure of consistency cost between teacher and student modules. Technically, MTOR firstly learns relational graphs that capture similarities between pairs of regions for teacher and student respectively. The whole architecture is then optimized with three consistency regularizations: 1) region-level consistency to align the region-level predictions between teacher and student, 2) inter-graph consistency for matching the graph structures between teacher and student, and 3) intra-graph consistency to enhance the similarity between regions of same class within the graph of student. Extensive experiments are conducted on the transfers across Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, and SIM10k, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches.

For instance, an SWFI generated from an air pollution database indicates a geographical region where people have been exposed to high levels of an air pollutant, say PM2.5. The generated SWFIs do not satisfy the anti-monotonic property. Two new measures have been presented to effectively reduce the search space and the computational cost of finding the desired patterns. A pattern-growth algorithm, called Spatial Weighted Frequent Pattern-growth, has also been presented to find all SWFIs in a spatiotemporal database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient. We also describe a case study in which our model has been used to find useful information in air pollution database.",60032325,Japan National Institute of Information and Communications Technology,Koganei,Japan,"['1706', '1712']",17.90909090909091,0.2535353535353536,0.3885252525252525,1,0.13274336283185842,0.05752212389380531,0.3425925925925926

Our method is built upon two core operations, interaction and propagation, and each operation is conducted by Convolutional Neural Networks. The two networks are connected both internally and externally so that the networks are trained jointly and interact with each other to solve the complex video object segmentation problem. We propose a new multi-round training scheme for the interactive video object segmentation so that the networks can learn how to understand the user's intention and update incorrect estimations during the training. At the testing time, our method produces high-quality results and also runs fast enough to work with users interactively. We evaluated the proposed method quantitatively on the interactive track benchmark at the DAVIS Challenge 2018.

However, the mixed multiple objects and sounds make it intractable to perform efficient matching in the unconstrained environment. To settle this problem, we propose to adequately excavate audio and visual components and perform elaborate correspondence learning among them. Concretely, a novel unsupervised audiovisual learning model is proposed, named as Deep Multimodal Clustering (DMC),that synchronously performs sets of clustering with multimodal vectors of convolutional maps in different shared spaces for capturing multiple audiovisual correspondences. And such integrated multimodal clustering network can be effectively trained with max-margin loss in the end-to-end fashion. Amounts of experiments in feature evaluation and audiovisual tasks are performed. The results demonstrate that DMC can learn effective unimodal representation, with which the classifier can even outperform human performance.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance in this field. It is well known, however, that no general algorithm is available for every application problem. For a new application task, it is very time-consuming for non-experts to design network structure, hyperparameters and an ensemble of base models adequately and effectively. In this paper, we present the genetic algorithm (GA) based approach in order to construct network structures automatically, tune their hyperparameters adequately and generate base models for the ensemble algorithm. Then the ensemble is constructed from the base models with different network structures. Our original personal identification dataset is employed as the numerical example in order to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. Convergence property, experiment results, as well as search performance are discussed in the numerical results.

190,193,193,Machine vision guided 3D medical image compression for efficient transmission and accurate segmentation in the clouds,"Cloud based medical image analysis has become popular recently due to the high computation complexities of various deep neural network (DNN) based frameworks and the increasingly large volume of medical images that need to be processed. It has been demonstrated that for medical images the transmission from local to clouds is much more expensive than the computation in the clouds itself. Towards this, 3D image compression techniques have been widely applied to reduce the data traffic. However, most of the existing image compression techniques are developed around human vision, i.e., they are designed to minimize distortions that can be perceived by human eyes. In this paper, we will use deep learning based medical image segmentation as a vehicle and demonstrate that interestingly, machine and human view the compression quality differently. Medical images compressed with good quality w.r.t. human vision may result in inferior segmentation accuracy. We then design a machine vision oriented 3D image compression framework tailored for segmentation using DNNs. Our method automatically extracts and retains image features that are most important to the segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on widely adopted segmentation frameworks with HVSMR 2016 challenge dataset show that our method can achieve significantly higher segmentation accuracy at the same compression rate, or much better compression rate under the same segmentation accuracy, when compared with the existing JPEG 2000 method.

This work presents Deep Product Quantization (DPQ), a technique that leads to more accurate retrieval and classification than the latest state of the art methods, while having similar computational complexity and memory footprint as the Product Quantization method. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a dictionary-based representation that is inspired by Product Quantization and which is learned end-to-end, and thus benefits from the supervised signal.

Once trained, it is employed for guided training of a motion encoder for blurred images. This network extracts embedded motion information from the blurred image to generate a sharp video in conjunction with the trained recurrent video decoder. As an intermediate step, we also design an efficient architecture that enables real-time single image deblurring and outperforms competing methods across all factors: Accuracy, speed, and compactness.

Given a multi-sentence paragraph, the story is visualized by generating a sequence of images, one for each sentence. In contrast to video generation, story visualization focuses less on the continuity in generated images (frames), but more on the global consistency across dynamic scenes and characters-a challenge that has not been addressed by any single-image or video generation methods. Therefore, we propose a new story-to-image-sequence generation model, StoryGAN, based on the sequential conditional GAN framework. Our model is unique in that it consists of a deep Context Encoder that dynamically tracks the story flow, and two discriminators at the story and image levels, to enhance the image quality and the consistency of the generated sequences.

It is of interest to the community to explicitly discover such biases, both for understanding the behavior of such models, and towards debugging them. Our work address this problem.

Our approach models these interactions and constraints jointly within a novel Multi-Agent Tensor Fusion (MATF) network. Specifically, the model encodes multiple agents' past trajectories and the scene context into a Multi-Agent Tensor, then applies convolutional fusion to capture multiagent interactions while retaining the spatial structure of agents and the scene context.

Specifically, to model the completeness of actions, we propose a multi-branch neural network in which branches are enforced to discover distinctive action parts. Complete actions can be therefore localized by fusing activations from different branches.

Approaches to deal with missing data can be partitioned into methods that impute substitute values and methods that introduce missing-indicator variables. In this work, we demonstrate that the missing-indicator method underperforms compared to any of the other imputation methods. Most studies either focus on minimizing the squared error for the imputed values or use the missing-indicator in machine learning tasks as an assumed best practice. We study the difference between the missing-indicator method and various imputation methods on classifier learning performance when data are missing completely at random (MCAR). We compute the classifier performance over 22 complete classification datasets of varying sample size and dimensionality from an open data repository, simulating synthetic missingness at different percentages. We compare classifier performances yielded by applying mean, median, linear regression, and tree-based regression imputation methods with the corresponding performances yielded by applying the missing-indicator approach. The impact is measured with respect to three different classifiers, namely a tree-based ensemble classifier, radial basis function support vector machine classifier and k-nearest neighbours classifier.

201,204,204,Temporal transformer networks: Joint learning of invariant and discriminative time warping,"Many time-series classification problems involve developing metrics that are invariant to temporal misalignment. In human activity analysis, temporal misalignment arises due to various reasons including differing initial phase, sensor sampling rates, and elastic time-warps due to subject-specific biomechanics. Past work in this area has only looked at reducing intra-class variability by elastic temporal alignment. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model-based and data-driven approach to learn warping functions that not just reduce intra-class variability, but also increase inter-class separation. We call this a temporal transformer network (TTN). TTN is an interpretable differentiable module, which can be easily integrated at the front end of a classification network. The module is capable of reducing intra-class variance by generating input-dependent warping functions which lead to rate-robust representations. At the same time, it increases inter-class variance by learning warping functions that are more discriminative.

However, research on that with low-quality input is limited, although it involves more applications. In this paper, we focus on 3D FR using low-quality data, targeting an efficient and accurate deep learning solution. To achieve this, we work on two aspects: (1) designing a lightweight yet powerful CNN; (2) generating finer and bigger training data. For (1), we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module and a Spatial Attention Vectorization (SAV) module to build a compact and discriminative CNN.

Since a neural network efficiently learns data distribution, a network is likely to learn the bias information to categorize input data. It leads to poor performance at test time, if the bias is, in fact, irrelevant to the categorization. In this paper, we formulate a regularization loss based on mutual information between feature embedding and bias. Based on the idea of minimizing this mutual information, we propose an iterative algorithm to unlearn the bias information. We employ an additional network to predict the bias distribution and train the network adversarially against the feature embedding network. At the end of learning, the bias prediction network is not able to predict the bias not because it is poorly trained, but because the feature embedding network successfully unlearns the bias information.

205,208,208,A generative appearance model for end-to-end video object segmentation,"One of the fundamental challenges in video object segmentation is to find an effective representation of the target and background appearance. The best performing approaches resort to extensive fine-tuning of a convolutional neural network for this purpose. Besides being prohibitively expensive, this strategy cannot be truly trained end-to-end since the online fine-tuning procedure is not integrated into the offline training of the network. To address these issues, we propose a network architecture that learns a powerful representation of the target and background appearance in a single forward pass. The introduced appearance module learns a probabilistic generative model of target and background feature distributions. Given a new image, it predicts the posterior class probabilities, providing a highly discriminative cue, which is processed in later network modules. Both the learning and prediction stages of our appearance module are fully differentiable, enabling true end-to-end training of the entire segmentation pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video object segmentation benchmarks.

206,209,209,Deep transfer learning with field-based measurements for large area classification,"Classification of Electro-Optical (EO) datasets using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has lead to high-performance supervised learning algorithms. However, DNNs require a large amount of labeled data for training which often have limited availability in ecological studies. Up-to-date classification of vegetation in sensitive Arctic ecosystems continue to be a challenge. In an ecosystem undergoing rapid change, capturing the dynamics of vegetation requires the existing maps of vegetation (such as Alaska Existing Vegetation Type (AKEVT), circa 2000) to be updated based on frequent field based observation of vegetation. A method is needed to transfer the knowledge gained from field-collected observations to a larger area using DNNs. Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on another similar task. This paper seeks to train DNNs using field-collected observations and apply transfer learning to apply the knowledge gained to update existing vegetation map at larger scale. We test two DNN methods, (1) a deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) model and (2) siamese MLP network that uses a structure to rank similarity between inputs and can be used for training datasets with few samples and show good performance with limited datasets (e.g. few-shot learning). The results show ~90% accuracy (using the field observations for evaluation) when transfer learning is applied to a siamese network, compared to ~45% accurate when a MLP is trained on the AKEVT and evaluated on the field observations.

208,211,211,Learning implicit fields for generative shape modeling,"We advocate the use of implicit fields for learning generative models of shapes and introduce an implicit field decoder, called IM-NET, for shape generation, aimed at improving the visual quality of the generated shapes. An implicit field assigns a value to each point in 3D space, so that a shape can be extracted as an iso-surface. IM-NET is trained to perform this assignment by means of a binary classifier. Specifically, it takes a point coordinate, along with a feature vector encoding a shape, and outputs a value which indicates whether the point is outside the shape or not. By replacing conventional decoders by our implicit decoder for representation learning (via IM-AE) and shape generation (via IM-GAN), we demonstrate superior results for tasks such as generative shape modeling, interpolation, and single-view 3D reconstruction, particularly in terms of visual quality.

209,212,212,DM-GAN: Dynamic memory generative adversarial networks for text-to-image synthesis,"In this paper, we focus on generating realistic images from text descriptions. Current methods first generate an initial image with rough shape and color, and then refine the initial image to a high-resolution one. Most existing text-to-image synthesis methods have two main problems. (1) These methods depend heavily on the quality of the initial images. If the initial image is not well initialized, the following processes can hardly refine the image to a satisfactory quality. (2) Each word contributes a different level of importance when depicting different image contents, however, unchanged text representation is used in existing image refinement processes. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Network (DM-GAN) to generate high-quality images. The proposed method introduces a dynamic memory module to refine fuzzy image contents, when the initial images are not well generated. A memory writing gate is designed to select the important text information based on the initial image content, which enables our method to accurately generate images from the text description. We also utilize a response gate to adaptively fuse the information read from the memories and the image features. We evaluate the DM-GAN model on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and the Microsoft Common Objects in Context dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our DM-GAN model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.",60023932,University of Technology Sydney,Sydney,Australia,"['1712', '1707']",18.166666666666668,0.04746376811594204,0.3264492753623189,1,0.12030075187969924,0.05639097744360902,0.3483606557377049

Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods struggle to process high-res imagery because of memory constraints or speed limitations. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end framework that searches for correspondences incrementally over a coarse-to-fine hierarchy. Because high-res stereo datasets are relatively rare, we introduce a dataset with high-res stereo pairs for both training and evaluation. Our approach achieved SOTA performance on Middlebury-v3 and KITTI-15 while running significantly faster than its competitors. The hierarchical design also naturally allows for anytime on-demand reports of disparity by capping intermediate coarse results, allowing us to accurately predict disparity for near-range structures with low latency (30ms). We demonstrate that the performance-vs-speed tradeoff afforded by on-demand hierarchies may address sensing needs for time-critical applications such as autonomous driving.",60027950,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707']",18.857142857142858,0.2305555555555556,0.5898148148148148,1,0.09239130434782608,0.016304347826086956,0.410958904109589
211,214,214,Utility evaluation measures for categorical data by classification performance,"In statistical disclosure control, global recoding is a typical masking method for categorical variable. When merging categories in global recoding, the decision of the minimum frequency ratio is essential from the point of view of both the reduction of the disclosure risk and the utility of masked data. Previous utility measures such as comparison of record value itself or contingency tables between original data and masked data can not evaluate masked data by global recoding. We propose a new information loss measure that can evaluate masked data by global recoding based on the model performance. Using the proposed information measure, we examined three hypotheses concerning global recoding, (a) when minimum frequency ratio increases, information loss increases, (b) when the number of input variable in model increases, information loss increases, (c) models yielding high performances in the original data suffer from large information loss by global recoding, by numerical experiments of the data of 2010 Population Census of Japan. For the performance measure by recall the hypotheses were supported, for that by accuracy, the hypotheses were supported, except for models that predicts a dominant category. Also, values of information loss for specific number of input variables and minimum frequency ratio are reported in our study. In the worst case, the mean of information loss of accuracy was 0.041, where the number of input variables was 4 and minimum frequency ratio was set at 0.05.

A potential disadvantage of such design is that it cannot capture the multiple visual context information of a word appearing in more than one relevant videos in training data. To tackle this limitation, we propose the Memory-Attended Recurrent Network (MARN) for video captioning, in which a memory structure is designed to explore the full-spectrum correspondence between a word and its various similar visual contexts across videos in training data. Thus, our model is able to achieve a more comprehensive understanding for each word and yield higher captioning quality. Furthermore, the built memory structure enables our method to model the compatibility between adjacent words explicitly instead of asking the model to learn implicitly, as most existing models do.

Unlike prior methods that typically attempt to ground each phrase independently by building an image-text embedding, our architecture formulates grounding of multiple phrases as a sequential and contextual process. Specifically, we encode region proposals and all phrases into two stacks of LSTM cells, along with so-far grounded phrase-region pairs. These LSTM stacks collectively capture context for grounding of the next phrase. The resulting architecture, which we call SeqGROUND, supports many-to-many matching by allowing an image region to be matched to multiple phrases and vice versa. We show competitive performance on the Flickr30K benchmark dataset and, through ablation studies, validate the efficacy of sequential grounding as well as individual design choices in our model architecture.",60032776,The Walt Disney Company,Burbank,United States,"['1712', '1707']",20.666666666666668,-0.023809523809523808,0.1464285714285714,1,0.10526315789473684,0.02631578947368421,0.34306569343065696

This work describes a transfer-based blackbox targeted adversarial attack of deep feature space representations that also provides insights into cross-model class representations of deep CNNs. The attack is explicitly designed for transferability and drives feature space representation of a source image at layer L towards the representation of a target image at L. The attack yields highly transferable targeted examples, which outperform competition winning methods by over 30% in targeted attack metrics. We also show the choice of L to generate examples from is important, transferability characteristics are blackbox model agnostic, and indicate that well trained deep models have similar highly-abstract representations.",60008724,Duke University,Durham,United States,"['1712', '1707']",24.8,0.09636363636363636,0.5036363636363638,1,0.11971830985915492,0.02112676056338028,0.2835820895522388
216,219,219,Apdrawinggan: Generating artistic portrait drawings from face photos with hierarchical gans,"Significant progress has been made with image stylization using deep learning, especially with generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, existing methods fail to produce high quality artistic portrait drawings. Such drawings have a highly abstract style, containing a sparse set of continuous graphical elements such as lines, and so small artifacts are much more exposed than for painting styles. Moreover, artists tend to use different strategies to draw different facial features and the lines drawn are only loosely related to obvious image features. To address these challenges, we propose APDrawingGAN, a novel GAN based architecture that builds upon hierarchical generators and discriminators combining both a global network (for images as a whole) and local networks (for individual facial regions). This allows dedicated drawing strategies to be learned for different facial features. Since artists' drawings may not have lines perfectly aligned with image features, we develop a novel loss to measure similarity between generated and artists' drawings based on distance transforms, leading to improved strokes in portrait drawing. To train APDrawingGAN, we construct an artistic drawing dataset containing high-resolution portrait photos and corresponding professional artistic drawings. Extensive experiments, including a user study, show that APDrawingGAN produces significantly better artistic drawings than state-of-the-art methods.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707']",22.33333333333333,0.11543010752688172,0.515752688172043,1,0.13025210084033614,0.01680672268907563,0.40869565217391307
217,220,220,An efficient schmidt-ekf for 3D visual-inertial slam,"It holds great implications for practical applications to enable centimeter-accuracy positioning for mobile and wearable sensor systems. In this paper, we propose a novel, high-precision, efficient visual-inertial (VI)-SLAM algorithm, termed Schmidt-EKF VI-SLAM (SEVIS), which optimally fuses IMU measurements and monocular images in a tightly-coupled manner to provide 3D motion tracking with bounded error. In particular, we adapt the Schmidt Kalman filter formulation to selectively include informative features in the state vector while treating them as nuisance parameters (or Schmidt states) once they become matured. This change in modeling allows for significant computational savings by no longer needing to constantly update the Schmidt states (or their covariance), while still allowing the EKF to correctly account for their cross-correlations with the active states. As a result, we achieve linear computational complexity in terms of map size, instead of quadratic as in the standard SLAM systems. In order to fully exploit the map information to bound navigation drifts, we advocate efficient keyframe-aided 2D-to-2D feature matching to find reliable correspondences between current 2D visual measurements and 3D map features.

To overcome these challenges, PAMN involves three main features: (1) progressive attention mechanism that utilizes cues from both question and answer to progressively prune out irrelevant temporal parts in memory, (2) dynamic modality fusion that adaptively determines the contribution of each modality for answering the current question, and (3) belief correction answering scheme that successively corrects the prediction score on each candidate answer. Experiments on publicly available benchmark datasets, MovieQA and TVQA, demonstrate that each feature contributes to our movie story QA architecture, PAMN, and improves performance to achieve the state-of-the-art result.

While linear upsampling is straight forward, it results in depth pixels being interpolated in empty space across discontinuities between objects. Current methods use deep networks to maintain gaps between objects. Nevertheless depth smearing remains a challenge. We propose a new representation for depth called Depth Coefficients (DC) to address this problem. It enables convolutions to more easily avoid inter-object depth mixing. We also show that the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function can promote depth mixing, and so we propose instead to use cross-entropy loss for DC. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluation are conducted on benchmarks, and we show that switching out sparse depth input and MSE loss functions with our DC representation and loss is a simple way to improve performance, reduce pixel depth mixing and can improve object detection.",60031707,Michigan State University,East Lansing,United States,"['1712', '1707']",18.75,0.08571969696969697,0.4532521645021645,1,0.15789473684210525,0.05263157894736842,0.3712574850299401

Related works use spatiotemporal 3D convolutions with fixed kernel size, too rigid to capture the varieties in temporal extents of complex actions, and too short for long-range temporal modeling. In contrast, we use multi-scale temporal convolutions, and we reduce the complexity of 3D convolutions. The outcome is Timeception convolution layers, which reasons about minute-long temporal patterns, a factor of 8 longer than best related works. As a result, Timeception achieves impressive accuracy in recognizing the human activities of Charades, Breakfast Actions and MultiTHUMOS.

This article studies a green vehicle routing problem considering dual services (HD and CP) with stochastic travel times (GVRP-DS-STT) to provide customers with sustainable and diversified delivery services. The GVRP-DS-STT problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic optimization model with recourse strategy. The purpose of the model is to minimize the total operational cost under stochastic environment. In addition, a two-stage heuristic algorithm integrating with a sampling strategy is developed to solve approximately the problem, the first of which is the greedy-based initial feasible solution generation, and the second of which is an improvement heuristic with late acceptance to explore the solution space. The computational results show that there are increasing benefit in terms of total operational cost, number of the vehicles used and loading rate with the increase of percentage of CP customers.

Recently, approaches that align distributions of source and target images using an adversarial loss have been proven effective for adapting object classifiers. However, for object detection, fully matching the entire distributions of source and target images to each other at the global image level may fail, as domains could have distinct scene layouts and different combinations of objects. On the other hand, strong matching of local features such as texture and color makes sense, as it does not change category level semantics. This motivates us to propose a novel method for detector adaptation based on strong local alignment and weak global alignment. Our key contribution is the weak alignment model, which focuses the adversarial alignment loss on images that are globally similar and puts less emphasis on aligning images that are globally dissimilar. Additionally, we design the strong domain alignment model to only look at local receptive fields of the feature map.

Autism is estimated to affect 1 in 59 children in the United States and costs roughly 35B to the society. Early diagnosis of ASD is vital for promoting early intervention and positive developmental outcomes. Traditional diagnostic procedures for ASD include structured behavioral observation by a trained clinician. Diagnosticians typically rely on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) to quantify ASD symptoms. In this paper, we take a parallel approach and investigate language modalities and discover associations between objective measurements of social communication and ASD symptoms. We analyze 33 children with autism and extract their linguistic patterns from their conversations with diagnosticians in a clinical setting.

229,232,232,A community-enhanced retrieval model for text-rich heterogeneous information networks,"In recent years, we have witnessed a large increase in the number of available text-rich heterogeneous networks, in which text documents, users and other objects are interconnected in various ways. Examples include social networks, bibliographic information networks, and collaboration networks. Text-rich heterogeneous networks contain text nodes (e.g., user comments in social networks; scientific publications in bibliographic networks), non-text nodes (e.g., users and companies in social networks), as well as rich relationships between different types of nodes. An important task, which is very useful on its own right, as well as often serves as a preprocessing to mining and analytical tasks, is identifying relevant text information from the heterogeneous information networks given user queries. Unlike Web search and many related problems, the effects of the underlying semantically meaningful patterns in heterogeneous networks play an important role in determining relevant answers for user search queries. For example, there are several structural patterns we can explore to more effectively identify relevant text nodes for a given query. The relevant nodes are likely to come from the same user-topic communities as the query. In addition, the relevant nodes on the same query topic tend to form tight local relationships with each other in the same user-topic community. In this paper, we present a unified and principled framework that effectively integrates network community and local relationship detection with retrieval model construction in a mutually enhancing manner, which leads to a community-enhanced retrieval model for text-rich heterogeneous information networks.

230,233,233,Collaborative spatiotemporal feature learning for video action recognition,"Spatiotemporal feature learning is of central importance for action recognition in videos. Existing deep neural network models either learn spatial and temporal features independently (C2D) or jointly with unconstrained parameters (C3D). In this paper, we propose a novel neural operation which encodes spatiotemporal features collaboratively by imposing a weight-sharing constraint on the learnable parameters. In particular, we perform 2D convolution along three orthogonal views of volumetric video data, which learns spatial appearance and temporal motion cues respectively. By sharing the convolution kernels of different views, spatial and temporal features are collaboratively learned and thus benefit from each other. The complementary features are subsequently fused by a weighted summation whose coefficients are learned end-to-end. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale benchmarks and won the 1st place in the Moments in Time Challenge 2018. Moreover, based on the learned coefficients of different views, we are able to quantify the contributions of spatial and temporal features.

This paper presented an interpretation of edge selection/reweighting in terms of variational Bayes inference, and therefore developed a novel variational expectation maximization (VEM) algorithm with built-in adaptive edge selection for blind deblurring.

Most previous deep metric learning methods employ the hard negative mining strategy to alleviate the lack of informative samples for training. However, this mining strategy only utilizes a subset of training data, which may not be enough to characterize the global geometry of the embedding space comprehensively. To address this problem, we perform linear interpolation on embeddings to adaptively manipulate their hard levels and generate corresponding label-preserving synthetics for recycled training, so that information buried in all samples can be fully exploited and the metric is always challenged with proper difficulty.

In heavy rain, streaks are strongly visible, dense rain accumulation or rain veiling effect significantly washes out the image, further scenes are relatively more blurry, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address these problems. We put forth a 2-stage network: A physics-based backbone followed by a depth-guided GAN refinement. The first stage estimates the rain streaks, the transmission, and the atmospheric light governed by the underlying physics. To tease out these components more reliably, a guided filtering framework is used to decompose the image into its low-and high-frequency components. This filtering is guided by a rain-free residue image-its content is used to set the passbands for the two channels in a spatially-variant manner so that the background details do not get mixed up with the rain-streaks. For the second stage, the refinement stage, we put forth a depth-guided GAN to recover the background details failed to be retrieved by the first stage, as well as correcting artefacts introduced by that stage.

Images, however, only show the superposition of different variable factors such as appearance or shape. Therefore, learning to disentangle and represent these different characteristics poses a great challenge, especially in the unsupervised case. Moreover, large object articulation calls for a flexible part-based model. We present an unsupervised approach for disentangling appearance and shape by learning parts consistently over all instances of a category. Our model for learning an object representation is trained by simultaneously exploiting invariance and equivariance constraints between synthetically transformed images. Since no part annotation or prior information on an object class is required, the approach is applicable to arbitrary classes. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of object categories and diverse tasks including pose prediction, disentangled image synthesis, and video-to-video translation.

235,238,238,RePr: Improved training of convolutional filters,"A well-trained Convolutional Neural Network can easily be pruned without significant loss of performance. This is because of unnecessary overlap in the features captured by the network's filters. Innovations in network architecture such as skip/dense connections and inception units have mitigated this problem to some extent, but these improvements come with increased computation and memory requirements at run-time. We attempt to address this problem from another angle-not by changing the network structure but by altering the training method. We show that by temporarily pruning and then restoring a subset of the model's filters, and repeating this process cyclically, overlap in the learned features is reduced, producing improved generalization. We show that the existing model-pruning criteria are not optimal for selecting filters to prune in this context, and introduce inter-filter orthogonality as the ranking criteria to determine under-expressive filters.

XNMs allow us to pay more attention to teach machines how to ""think"", regardless of what they ""look"". As we will show in the paper, by using scene graphs as an inductive bias, 1) we can design XNMs in a concise and flexible fashion, i.e., XNMs merely consist of 4 meta-types, which significantly reduce the number of parameters by 10 to 100 times, and 2) we can explicitly trace the reasoning-flow in terms of graph attentions. XNMs are so generic that they support a wide range of scene graph implementations with various qualities. For example, when the graphs are detected perfectly, XNMs achieve 100% accuracy on both CLEVR and CLEVR CoGenT, establishing an empirical performance upper-bound for visual reasoning; when the graphs are noisily detected from real-world images, XNMs are still robust to achieve a competitive 67.5% accuracy on VQAv2.0, surpassing the popular bag-of-objects attention models without graph structures.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707']",39.8,0.13653846153846153,0.4442307692307693,1,0.1214574898785425,0.032388663967611336,0.37554585152838427

We argue that a good question is one that has a tightly focused purpose--one that is aimed at expecting a specific type of response. We build a model that maximizes mutual information between the image, the expected answer and the generated question. To overcome the non-differentiability of discrete natural language tokens, we introduce a variational continuous latent space onto which the expected answers project. We regularize this latent space with a second latent space that ensures clustering of similar answers. Even when we don't know the expected answer, this second latent space can generate goal-driven questions specifically aimed at extracting objects (""what is the person throwing""), attributes, (""What kind of shirt is the person wearing?""), color (""what color is the frisbee?""), material (""What material is the frisbee?""), etc. We quantitatively show that our model is able to retain information about an expected answer category, resulting in more diverse, goal-driven questions.

Previous methods first register the input low dynamic range (LDR) images using optical flow before merging them, which are error-prone and cause ghosts in results. A very recent work tries to bypass optical flows via a deep network with skip-connections, however, which still suffers from ghosting artifacts for severe movement. To avoid the ghosting from the source, we propose a novel attention-guided end-to-end deep neural network (AHDRNet) to produce high-quality ghost-free HDR images. Unlike previous methods directly stacking the LDR images or features for merging, we use attention modules to guide the merging according to the reference image. The attention modules automatically suppress undesired components caused by misalignments and saturation and enhance desirable fine details in the non-reference images. In addition to the attention model, we use dilated residual dense block (DRDB) to make full use of the hierarchical features and increase the receptive field for hallucinating the missing details.

Through an examination of its adaptive behavior, we observe that while the spatial support for its neural features conforms more closely than regular ConvNets to object structure, this support may nevertheless extend well beyond the region of interest, causing features to be influenced by irrelevant image content. To address this problem, we present a reformulation of Deformable ConvNets that improves its ability to focus on pertinent image regions, through increased modeling power and stronger training. The modeling power is enhanced through a more comprehensive integration of deformable convolution within the network, and by introducing a modulation mechanism that expands the scope of deformation modeling. To effectively harness this enriched modeling capability, we guide network training via a proposed feature mimicking scheme that helps the network to learn features that reflect the object focus and classification power of R-CNN features.

However, variations of feature distributions across different domains result in a non-trivial solution of multi-domain learning. The state-of-the-art work regarding multi-domain classification aims to extract domain-invariant features and domain-specific features independently. However, they view the distributions of features from different classes as a general distribution and try to match these distributions across domains, which lead to the mixture of features from different classes across domains and degrade the performance of classification. Additionally, existing works only force the shared features among domains to be orthogonal to the features in the domain-specific network. However, redundant features between the domain-specific networks still remain, which may shrink the discriminative ability of domain-specific features. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end network to obtain the more optimal features, which we call compact features. We propose to extract the domain-invariant features by matching the joint distributions of different domains, which have dis-tinct boundaries between different classes.

Among the core challenges are the diversity of appearance a given object may possess and, as a result, exponential set of images consistent with a specified layout.

Given the coarse spatial layout (bounding boxes + object categories), our model can generate a set of realistic images which have the correct objects in the desired locations. The representation of each object is disentangled into a specified/certain part (category) and an unspecified/uncertain part (appearance). The category is encoded using a word embedding and the appearance is distilled into a low-dimensional vector sampled from a normal distribution. Individual object representations are composed together using convolutional LSTM, to obtain an encoding of the complete layout, and then decoded to an image. Several loss terms are introduced to encourage accurate and diverse generation. The proposed Layout2Im model significantly outperforms the previous state of the art, boosting the best reported inception score by 24.66% and 28.57% on the very challenging COCO-Stuff and Visual Genome datasets, respectively.

We show that coupling multiple such DIPs provides a powerful tool for decomposing images into their basic components, for a wide variety of applications. This capability stems from the fact that the internal statistics of a mixture of layers is more complex than the statistics of each of its individual components. We show the power of this approach for Image-Dehazing, Fg/Bg Segmentation, Watermark-Removal, Transparency Separation in images and video, and more. These capabilities are achieved in a totally unsupervised way, with no training examples other than the input image/video itself.",60017563,Weizmann Institute of Science Israel,Rehovot,Israel,"['1712', '1707']",23.5,0.106203007518797,0.3972431077694236,1,0.06437768240343347,0.04721030042918455,0.3256880733944954

By adapting the importance of the object classes to their error rates, our deep embedding algorithm can train multiple complementary deep networks sequentially, where each of them focuses on achieving higher accuracy rates for different subsets of object classes in an easy-to-hard way. By integrating such complementary deep networks to generate an ensemble network, our deep embedding algorithm can improve the accuracy rates for the hard object classes (which initially have higher error rates) at certain degrees while effectively preserving high accuracy rates for the easy object classes.

In order to adapt to novel zero-shot tasks, our meta-learner learns from the model parameters of known tasks (with ground truth) and the correlation of known tasks to zero-shot tasks. Such intuition finds its foothold in cognitive science, where a subject (human baby) can adapt to a novel concept (depth understanding) by correlating it with old concepts (hand movement or self-motion), without receiving an explicit supervision. We evaluated our model on the Taskonomy dataset, with four tasks as zero-shot: Surface normal, room layout, depth and camera pose estimation. These tasks were chosen based on the data acquisition complexity and the complexity associated with the learning process using a deep network. Our proposed methodolgy outperforms state-of-the-art models (which use ground truth) on each of our zero-shot tasks, showing promise on zero-shot task transfer.

The optimized model is obtained by weighted least-squares fitting where the weights come from the marginalization over sigma of the point likelihoods of being inliers. A new quality function is proposed not requiring sigma and, thus, a set of inliers to determine the model quality. Also, a new termination criterion for RANSAC is built on the proposed marginalization approach. Applying sigma-consensus, MAGSAC is proposed with no need for a user-defined sigma and improving the accuracy of robust estimation significantly. It is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of geometric accuracy on publicly available real-world datasets for epipolar geometry (F and E) and homography estimation.

256,260,260,Network2Vec: Learning node representation based on space mapping in networks,"Complex networks represented as node adjacency matrices constrains the application of machine learning and parallel algorithms. To address this limitation, network embedding (i.e., graph representation) has been intensively studied to learn a fixed-length vector for each node in an embedding space, where the node properties in the original graph are preserved. Existing methods mainly focus on learning embedding vectors to preserve nodes proximity, i.e., nodes next to each other in the graph space should also be closed in the embedding space, but do not enforce algebraic statistical properties to be shared between the embedding space and graph space. In this work, we propose a lightweight model, entitled Network2Vec, to learn network embedding on the base of semantic distance mapping between the graph space and embedding space. The model builds a bridge between the two spaces leveraging the property of group homomorphism. Experiments on different learning tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and community visualization, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the new embedding method, which improves the state-of-the-art model by 19% in node classification and 7% in link prediction tasks at most.

257,261,261,Combining news sentiment and technical analysis to predict stock trend reversal,"The use of machine learning techniques to predict the next-day stock direction is established. To make prediction models more robust, a common approach is to combine historical time series and news sentiment analysis. Most of the trading simulations performed in this field rely on trend following strategies, which are aimed at identifying and following an ongoing price trend that is likely to persist in the next days. Conversely, a more limited effort has been devoted to applying machine learning techniques to predict trend reversal, i.e., changes in price directions. This paper investigates the relevance of news information and time series descriptors derived from technical analysis to predict trend reversal in the next days. It compares the performance of various classification models trained on (i) technical indicators, which indicate short-term overbought or oversold conditions, (ii) news sentiment descriptors, which express the opinion of the financial community, (iii) the historical time series, to highlight recurrences in price trends, and (iv) a combination of the above. The results achieved on an 11-year dataset related to the stocks of the U.S. S&P 500 index show that the strategies combining the historical values of news sentiment and stock price indicators averagely perform better than all the other tested combinations.

Our empirical study shows that the accuracy and the score of a prediction are highly correlated with the variance of multiple stochastic inferences given by stochastic depth or dropout. Motivated by this observation, we design a novel variance-weighted confidence-integrated loss function that is composed of two cross-entropy loss terms with respect to ground-truth and uniform distribution, which are balanced by variance of stochastic prediction scores. The proposed loss function enables us to learn deep neural networks that predict confidence calibrated scores using a single inference.

260,264,264,Action-triggering recommenders: Uplift optimization and persuasive explanation,"A principal purpose of recommender systems is to induce positive user actions such as clicks and purchases. The performance of a recommender is typically evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy; a recommender is considered to be better if a larger number of its recommended items are purchased. However, accurate prediction is not enough for increasing user actions. The items might have been purchased even without recommendations, that is, the purchases are not triggered by the recommendations. Conversely, a user might be reluctant to purchase any items and a mere recommendation alone cannot motivate the user to purchase an item even if the recommended item is the best among all the items. In this work, we pursue recommender systems for triggering user actions. For this purpose, we tackle two issues: 1) uplift optimization and 2) persuasive explanation. For the first issue, we propose uplift-based evaluation and optimization methods for recommenders. Uplift, which is defined as an increase in user actions caused by recommendations, cannot be observed directly. We apply a causal inference framework to estimate the average uplift for the offline evaluation of recommenders. For optimization, we derive positive and negative samples specific to uplift and construct pointwise and pairwise optimization methods. Through experiments with three public datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization methods in improving uplift. For the second issue, we propose a new explanation style using context. The context style explanation presents contexts suitable for consuming the recommended items. The exhibited contexts make users imagine situations of items' usage and motivate them to purchase the items. Via a crowdsourcing-based user study, we confirm that the persuasiveness of our explanation style is better than conventional styles. The hybridization of context style with other styles further improves the persuasiveness.",60014256,University of Tsukuba,Tsukuba,Japan,"['1706', '1712']",17.058823529411768,0.1089732731037079,0.4211274233013364,1,0.13293051359516617,0.006042296072507553,0.29357798165137616

One of the most effective strategies to improve robustness is adversarial training. In this paper, we investigate the effect of adversarial training on the geometry of the classification landscape and decision boundaries. We show in particular that adversarial training leads to a significant decrease in the curvature of the loss surface with respect to inputs, leading to a drastically more 'linear' behaviour of the network. Using a locally quadratic approximation, we provide theoretical evidence on the existence of a strong relation between large robustness and small curvature. To further show the importance of reduced curvature for improving the robustness, we propose a new regularizer that directly minimizes curvature of the loss surface, and leads to adversarial robustness that is on par with adversarial training. Besides being a more efficient and principled alternative to adversarial training, the proposed regularizer confirms our claims on the importance of exhibiting quasi-linear behavior in the vicinity of data points in order to achieve robustness.",60111161,DeepMind Technologies Limited,London,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1707']",24.42857142857143,0.18504329004329004,0.4683189033189034,1,0.0979381443298969,0.0,0.23783783783783785

We exploit a Conditional Prior Network, that allows associating a probability to each depth value given an image, and combine it with a likelihood term that uses the sparse measurements. Optionally we can also exploit the availability of stereo during training, but in any case only require a single image and a sparse point cloud at run-time.

The proposed framework utilizes a novel lightweight stackable decoder-encoder module which uses convolutional re-sampling layers to improve features while maintaining efficient memory and runtime cost. Unlike previous cascaded detection systems, our proposed framework is designed within a region proposal network and thus retains greater context of nearby detections compared to independently processed RoI systems. We explicitly encourage increasing levels of precision by assigning strict labeling policies to each consecutive phase such that early phases develop features primarily focused on achieving high recall and later on accurate precision. In consequence, the final feature maps form more peaky radial gradients emulating from the centroids of unique pedestrians. Using our proposed autoregressive framework leads to new state-of-the-art performance on the reasonable and occlusion settings of the Caltech pedestrian dataset, and achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset.",60031707,Michigan State University,East Lansing,United States,"['1712', '1707']",25.0,0.16904356060606066,0.4512215909090909,1,0.15428571428571428,0.017142857142857144,0.36477987421383645

However, most current methods only allow for users to guide this image generation process through limited interactions. In this work we develop a novel GAN framework that allows humans to be 'in-the-loop' of the image generation process. Our technique iteratively accepts relative constraints of the form 'Generate an image more like image A than image B'. After each constraint is given, the user is presented with new outputs from the GAN, informing the next round of feedback. This feedback is used to constrain the output of the GAN with respect to an underlying semantic space that can be designed to model a variety of different notions of similarity (e.g. classes, attributes, object relationships, color, etc.). In our experiments, we show that our GAN framework is able to generate images that are of comparable quality to equivalent unsupervised GANs while satisfying a large number of the constraints provided by users, effectively changing a GAN into one that allows users interactive control over image generation without sacrificing image quality.",60011972,Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate,Rome,United States,"['1712', '1707']",24.0,0.20146103896103892,0.44879870129870136,1,0.10714285714285714,0.03571428571428571,0.3101851851851852

Due to this pace of NGS data generation, new methods are necessary in order to facilitate rapid sequence analysis at the enormous scale required. The need for such methods is further compounded by the dropping financial cost of sequencing, leading to the normalization of large-scale genome studies spanning entire populations. A key process in the genomic data analysis pipeline, and one that is often most time consuming, is read mapping or so-called alignment. This paper introduces Sequence Alignment Memorizer (SeAlM), a technique that reduces the number of redundant alignments to enable population-scale workloads. SeAlM uses a novel method for reordering alignment queries from multiple sources to create batches with increased likelihood of containing redundant queries that can be de-duplicated before alignment, while also ordering those batches to improve the ability to cache queries effectively. We show that our technique can improve the average throughput of alignment for a single human sample by 6.5% and a population of 10 human subjects by 13.6% -18.8% depending on the type of genetic data used.",60010307,University of Colorado at Denver,Denver,United States,"['1706', '1712']",27.714285714285715,0.027218614718614715,0.4371572871572871,1,0.14666666666666667,0.04888888888888889,0.32558139534883723

Most existing methods fuse features by temporal average-pooling, without exploring the different frame weights caused by various viewpoints, poses, and occlusions. In this paper, we propose an attribute-driven method for feature disentangling and frame re-weighting. The features of single frames are disentangled into groups of sub-features, each corresponds to specific semantic attributes. The sub-features are re-weighted by the confidence of attribute recognition and then aggregated at the temporal dimension as the final representation. By means of this strategy, the most informative regions of each frame are enhanced and contributes to a more discriminative sequence representation. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of feature disentangling as well as temporal re-weighting.

To address ambiguity, beam search is the de facto method for sampling multiple captions. However, beam search is computationally expensive and known to produce generic captions. To address this concern, some variational auto-encoder (VAE) and generative adversarial net (GAN) based methods have been proposed. Though diverse, GAN and VAE are less accurate. In this paper, we first predict a meaningful summary of the image, then generate the caption based on that summary.

We achieve the trifecta: (1) High accuracy for the diverse captions as evaluated by standard captioning metrics and user studies; (2) Faster computation of diverse captions compared to beam search and diverse beam search; and (3) High diversity as evaluated by counting novel sentences, distinct n-grams and mutual overlap (i.e., mBleu-4) scores.",60114181,Tencent,Shenzhen,China,"['1712', '1707']",18.625,0.09355555555555556,0.3908888888888889,1,0.1,0.021052631578947368,0.4175824175824176

We further add a gate structure to each block, which can adaptively decide the loop times of recursive blocks to reduce the computational cost. Since the recursive networks are hard to train, we propose the Loopy Variable Batch Normalization (LVBN) to stabilize the volatile gradient.

However, inferring 3D gaze direction is challenging even for deep neural networks given the lack of large amount of data (groundtruthing gaze is expensive and existing datasets use different setups) and the inherent presence of gaze biases due to person-specific difference. In this work, we address the problem of person-specific gaze model adaptation from only a few reference training samples. The main and novel idea is to improve gaze adaptation by generating additional training samples through the synthesis of gaze-redirected eye images from existing reference samples. In doing so, our contributions are threefold:(i) we design our gaze redirection framework from synthetic data, allowing us to benefit from aligned training sample pairs to predict accurate inverse mapping fields; (ii) we proposed a self-supervised approach for domain adaptation; (iii) we exploit the gaze redirection to improve the performance of person-specific gaze estimation.

In this work, we propose a semantically aligned paired cycle-consistent generative (SEM-PCYC) model for zero-shot SBIR, where each branch maps the visual information to a common semantic space via an adversarial training. Each of these branches maintains a cycle consistency that only requires supervision at category levels, and avoids the need of highly-priced aligned sketch-image pairs. A classification criteria on the generators' outputs ensures the visual to semantic space mapping to be discriminating. Furthermore, we propose to combine textual and hierarchical side information via a feature selection auto-encoder that selects discriminating side information within a same end-to-end model.

Transparency can be significantly improved by replacing conventional electric motors with passive actuators such as brakes or dampers. Passive actuators can display a wide range of impedance and since they can only dis-sipate energy, stability is guaranteed. However, passive haptic devices suffer from a serious drawback; the direction of the force output is difficult to control. This issue was addressed extensively for planar manipulators but devices with higher degrees-of-freedom (DOF) have not been examined. In this paper, we introduce a new analytical framework to evaluate the feasibility and performance of non-redundant passive haptic manipulators with any DOF. The method identifies different regions in the workspace where a force can be created or approximated, and regions where a passive system cannot create force at all for a given user input. The results indicate that the range of forces a passive device can display increases with the number of DOF.

Also, the similarity between expressions measured in the action unit space need not correspond to how humans perceive expression similarity. Different from previous work, our goal is to describe facial expressions in a continuous fashion using a compact embedding space that mimics human visual preferences. To achieve this goal, we collect a large-scale faces-in-the-wild dataset with human annotations in the form: Expressions A and B are visually more similar when compared to expression C, and use this dataset to train a neural network that produces a compact (16-dimensional) expression embedding.

One common trait of many networks is that they refine an initial flow estimate either through multiple stages or across the levels of a coarse-to-fine representation. While leading to more accurate results, the downside of this is an increased number of parameters. Taking inspiration from both classical energy minimization approaches as well as residual networks, we propose an iterative residual refinement (IRR) scheme based on weight sharing that can be combined with several backbone networks.

However, the existing methods often generate contents with blurry textures and distorted structures due to the discontinuity of the local pixels. From a semantic-level perspective, the local pixel discontinuity is mainly because these methods ignore the semantic relevance and feature continuity of hole regions. To handle this problem, we investigate the human behavior in repairing pictures and propose a fined deep generative model-based approach with a novel coherent semantic attention (CSA) layer, which can not only preserve contextual structure but also make more effective predictions of missing parts by modeling the semantic relevance between the holes features. The task is divided into rough, refinement as two steps and we model each step with a neural network under the U-Net architecture, where the CSA layer is embedded into the encoder of refinement step. Meanwhile, we further propose consistency loss and feature patch discriminator to stabilize the network training process and improve the details.

291,295,295,Multispectral imaging for fine-grained recognition of powders on complex backgrounds,"Hundreds of materials, such as drugs, explosives, makeup, food additives, are in the form of powder. Recognizing such powders is important for security checks, criminal identification, drug control, and quality assessment. However, powder recognition has drawn little attention in the computer vision community. Powders are hard to distinguish: they are amorphous, appear matte, have little color or texture variation and blend with surfaces they are deposited on in complex ways. To address these challenges, we present the first comprehensive dataset and approach for powder recognition using multi-spectral imaging. By using Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) multi-spectral imaging together with visible light (RGB) and Near Infrared (NIR), powders can be discriminated with reasonable accuracy.

To properly understand the characteristics of customers and implement high accurate marketing measures, a model analysis that considers customer heterogeneity is required. This study focuses on artificial intelligence, which has been rapidly developing in recent years, and the study incorporates customer heterogeneity into machine-learning model parameters.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive fine-tuning approach, called SpotTune, which finds the optimal fine-tuning strategy per instance for the target data. In SpotTune, given an image from the target task, a policy network is used to make routing decisions on whether to pass the image through the fine-tuned layers or the pre-trained layers. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our method outperforms the traditional fine-tuning approach on 12 out of 14 standard datasets.

This leads to low modal diversity and at times distorted generated samples. These problems essentially arise from poor estimation of the distance metric responsible for training these networks. To address these issues, we introduce an additional regularisation term which performs optimal transport in parallel within a low dimensional representation space. We demonstrate that operating in a low dimension representation of the data distribution benefits from convergence rate gains in estimating the Wasserstein distance, resulting in more stable GAN training. We empirically show that our regulariser achieves a stabilising effect which leads to higher quality of generated samples and increased mode coverage of the given data distribution.

In this work, we propose a new Progressive Cross-stream Cooperation (PCSC) framework to iterative improve action localization results and generate better bounding boxes for one stream (i.e., Flow/RGB) by leveraging both region proposals and features from another stream (i.e., RGB/Flow) in an iterative fashion. Specifically, we first generate a larger set of region proposals by combining the latest region proposals from both streams, from which we can readily obtain a larger set of labelled training samples to help learn better action detection models. Second, we also propose a new message passing approach to pass information from one stream to another stream in order to learn better representations, which also leads to better action detection models. As a result, our iterative framework progressively improves action localization results at the frame level. To improve action localization results at the video level, we additionally propose a new strategy to train class-specific actionness detectors for better temporal segmentation, which can be readily learnt by using the training samples around temporal boundaries.

We further reduce task interference by forcing the task gradients to be statistically indistinguishable through adversarial training, ensuring that the common backbone architecture serving all tasks is not dominated by any of the task-specific gradients. Results in three multi-task dense labelling problems consistently show: (i) a large reduction in the number of parameters while preserving, or even improving performance and (ii) a smooth trade-off between computation and multi-task accuracy.

For example, 3D rotations can be represented with quaternions or Euler angles. In this paper, we advance a definition of a continuous representation, which can be helpful for training deep neural networks. We relate this to topological concepts such as homeomorphism and embedding. We then investigate what are continuous and discontinuous representations for 2D, 3D, and n-dimensional rotations. We demonstrate that for 3D rotations, all representations are discontinuous in the real Euclidean spaces of four or fewer dimensions. Thus, widely used representations such as quaternions and Euler angles are discontinuous and difficult for neural networks to learn. We show that the 3D rotations have continuous representations in 5D and 6D, which are more suitable for learning. We also present continuous representations for the general case of the n-dimensional rotation group SO(n). While our main focus is on rotations, we also show that our constructions apply to other groups such as the orthogonal group and similarity transforms.

While recent studies have shown impressive progress in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based facial reconstruction, the settings are mostly restricted to a single view. There is an inherent drawback in the single-view setting: The lack of reliable 3D constraints can cause unresolvable ambiguities. We in this paper explore 3DMM-based shape recovery in a different setting, where a set of multi-view facial images are given as input. A novel approach is proposed to regress 3DMM parameters from multi-view inputs with an end-to-end trainable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Multi-view geometric constraints are incorporated into the network by establishing dense correspondences between different views leveraging a novel self-supervised view alignment loss. The main ingredient of the view alignment loss is a differentiable dense optical flow estimator that can backpropagate the alignment errors between an input view and a synthetic rendering from another input view, which is projected to the target view through the 3D shape to be inferred. Through minimizing the view alignment loss, better 3D shapes can be recovered such that the synthetic projections from one view to another can better align with the observed image.

Often, the inability to focus on the inputs and the delivery processes leads to improper service quality which inevitably hampers the overall brand of the institute. The aim of this study is to improve service quality through customer satisfaction in B-School setting. There is a significant gap while considering the entire dimensions in service quality model for B-schools. Furthermore, institutes need to increase customer satisfaction to decrease service quality gap score. The method used for investigating service quality gap was the standard SERVQUAL model. This model includes 5 dimensions, tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy. All these dimensions have considerable factors to measure customer satisfaction. A total of 120 responses of Post Graduate students undergoing Management programme were analyzed to identify the quality gap in educational services.

The retailer needs not to pay the manufacturer immediately whenever retailer receives goods, if a manufacturer offers credit period to the retailer. In this scenario focusing on the overall performance of the supply chain in terms of cycle time variations, inventory levels, rate of shipment and the annual total relevant cost of the entire supply chain is essential. The objective of the proposed work is to illustrate the optimality of cycle time, levels of inventory, rate of shipment and the total relevant cost of the coordinated supply chain under cubic price dependent demand with trade credit. Mathematical models are developed to determine decision variables and objective function value.

315,320,320,Modeling local geometric structure of 3D point clouds using geo-cnn,"Recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have motivated researchers to adapt CNNs to directly model points in 3D point clouds. Modeling local structure has been proven to be important for the success of convolutional architectures, and researchers exploited the modeling of local point sets in the feature extraction hierarchy. However, limited attention has been paid to explicitly model the geometric structure amongst points in a local region. To address this problem, we propose Geo-CNN, which applies a generic convolution-like operation dubbed as GeoConv to each point and its local neighborhood. Local geometric relationships among points are captured when extracting edge features between the center and its neighboring points. We first decompose the edge feature extraction process onto three orthogonal bases, and then aggregate the extracted features based on the angles between the edge vector and the bases. This encourages the network to preserve the geometric structure in Euclidean space throughout the feature extraction hierarchy. GeoConv is a generic and efficient operation that can be easily integrated into 3D point cloud analysis pipelines for multiple applications. We evaluate Geo-CNN on ModelNet40 and KITTI and achieve state-of-the-art performance.",60020304,University of Maryland,College Park,United States,"['1712', '1707']",20.88888888888889,0.07717086834733895,0.2035014005602241,1,0.10648148148148148,0.037037037037037035,0.3137254901960784

In this work, we leverage on both random features and random neurons to perform analogical reasoning over Big Data. Due to their big size and dynamic nature, in fact, Big Data are hard to process with standard dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering algorithms. To this end, we apply random projection to generate a multi-dimensional vector space of commonsense knowledge and use an extreme learning machine to perform reasoning on it.

Given many safety-critical 3D applications such as autonomous driving, it is important to study how adversarial point clouds could affect current deep 3D models. In this work, we propose several novel algorithms to craft adversarial point clouds against PointNet, a widely used deep neural network for point cloud processing. Our algorithms work in two ways: Adversarial point perturbation and adversarial point generation. For point perturbation, we shift existing points negligibly. For point generation, we generate either a set of independent and scattered points or a small number (1-3) of point clusters with meaningful shapes such as balls and airplanes which could be hidden in the human psyche. In addition, we formulate six perturbation measurement metrics tailored to the attacks in point clouds and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms on the ModelNet40 3D shape classification dataset.

In an image, there would be regions that can be adapted better, for instance, the foreground object may be similar in nature. To obtain such regions, we propose methods that consider the probabilistic certainty estimate of various regions and specific focus on these during classification for adaptation.

In order to model the uncertainty in the location of the objects, we employ a dissimilarity coefficient based probabilistic learning objective. The learning objective minimizes the difference between an annotation agnostic prediction distribution and an annotation aware conditional distribution. The main computational challenge is the complex nature of the conditional distribution, which consists of terms over hundreds or thousands of variables. The complexity of the conditional distribution rules out the possibility of explicitly modeling it. Instead, we exploit the fact that deep learning frameworks rely on stochastic optimization.

This situation occurs when a camera's auto white balance fails or when the wrong manual white-balance setting is used. Even after decades of computational color constancy research, there are no effective solutions to this problem. The challenge lies not in identifying what the correct white balance should have been, but in the fact that the in-camera white-balance procedure is followed by several camera-specific nonlinear color manipulations that make it challenging to correct the image's colors in post-processing. This paper introduces the first method to explicitly address this problem. Our method is enabled by a dataset of over 65,000 pairs of incorrectly white-balanced images and their corresponding correctly white-balanced images. Using this dataset, we introduce a k-nearest neighbor strategy that is able to compute a nonlinear color mapping function to correct the image's colors.

328,333,333,Iterative reorganization with weak spatial constraints: Solving arbitrary jigsaw puzzles for unsupervised representation learning,"Learning visual features from unlabeled image data is an important yet challenging task, which is often achieved by training a model on some annotation-free information. We consider spatial contexts, for which we solve so-called jigsaw puzzles, i.e., each image is cut into grids and then disordered, and the goal is to recover the correct configuration. Existing approaches formulated it as a classification task by defining a fixed mapping from a small subset of configurations to a class set, but these approaches ignore the underlying relationship between different configurations and also limit their applications to more complex scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach which applies to jigsaw puzzles with an arbitrary grid size and dimensionality. We provide a fundamental and generalized principle, that weaker cues are easier to be learned in an unsupervised manner and also transfer better. In the context of puzzle recognition, we use an iterative manner which, instead of solving the puzzle all at once, adjusts the order of the patches in each step until convergence. In each step, we combine both unary and binary features of each patch into a cost function judging the correctness of the current configuration. Our approach, by taking similarity between puzzles into consideration, enjoys a more efficient way of learning visual knowledge. We verify the effectiveness of our approach from two aspects. First, it solves arbitrarily complex puzzles, including high-dimensional puzzles, that prior methods are difficult to handle.

329,334,334,"Spherical regression: Learning viewpoints, surface normals and 3D rotations on n-spheres","Many computer vision challenges require continuous outputs, but tend to be solved by discrete classification. The reason is classification's natural containment within a probability n-simplex, as defined by the popular softmax activation function. Regular regression lacks such a closed geometry, leading to unstable training and convergence to suboptimal local minima. Starting from this insight we revisit regression in convolutional neural networks. We observe many continuous output problems in computer vision are naturally contained in closed geometrical manifolds, like the Euler angles in viewpoint estimation or the normals in surface normal estimation. A natural framework for posing such continuous output problems are n-spheres, which are naturally closed geometric manifolds defined in the R (n+1) space. By introducing a spherical exponential mapping on n-spheres at the regression output, we obtain well-behaved gradients, leading to stable training. We show how our spherical regression can be utilized for several computer vision challenges, specifically viewpoint estimation, surface normal estimation and 3D rotation estimation.

Existing datasets either have a small proportion of questions about text (e.g., the VQA dataset) or are too small (e.g., the VizWiz dataset). TextVQA contains 45,336 questions on 28,408 images that require reasoning about text to answer. Second, we introduce a novel model architecture that reads text in the image, reasons about it in the context of the image and the question, and predicts an answer which might be a deduction based on the text and the image or composed of the strings found in the image. Consequently, we call our approach Look, Read, Reason & Answer (LoRRA). We show that LoRRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art VQA models on our TextVQA dataset.

UODR is challenging due to the domain discrepancy, which becomes even harder to bridge when a large number of unknown categories exist in T. Moreover, the classification rules propagated by graph CNN (GCN) may be distracted by unknown categories and lack generalization capability. To measure the domain discrepancy for asymmetric label space between S and T, we propose Semantic-Guided Matching Discrepancy (SGMD), which first employs instance matching between S and T, and then the discrepancy is measured by a weighted feature distance between matched instances. We further design a limited balance constraint to achieve a more balanced classification output on known and unknown categories. We develop Unsupervised Open Domain Transfer Network (UODTN), which learns both the backbone classification network and GCN jointly by reducing the SGMD, enforcing the limited balance constraint and minimizing the classification loss on S.

To construct a VCTree, we design a score function that calculates the task-dependent validity between each object pair, and the tree is the binary version of the maximum spanning tree from the score matrix. Then, visual contexts are encoded by bidirectional TreeLSTM and decoded by task-specific models. We develop a hybrid learning procedure which integrates end-task supervised learning and the tree structure reinforcement learning, where the former's evaluation result serves as a self-critic for the latter's structure exploration.

Initial ranking is based on image descriptors extracted from convolutional neural network activations by global pooling, as in recent state-of-the-art work.

These local features are then robustly matched to approximate the optimal alignment of the tensors. This happens without any network modification, additional layers or training. No local feature detection happens on the original image. No local feature descriptors and no visual vocabulary are needed throughout the whole process.

339,345,345,Learning with batch-wise optimal transport loss for 3D shape recognition,"Deep metric learning is essential for visual recognition. The widely used pair-wise (or triplet) based loss objectives cannot make full use of semantical information in training samples or give enough attention to those hard samples during optimization. Thus, they often suffer from a slow convergence rate and inferior performance. In this paper, we show how to learn an importance-driven distance metric via optimal transport programming from batches of samples. It can automatically emphasize hard examples and lead to significant improvements in convergence. We propose a new batch-wise optimal transport loss and combine it in an end-to-end deep metric learning manner. We use it to learn the distance metric and deep feature representation jointly for recognition. Empirical results on visual retrieval and classification tasks with six benchmark datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR10, SHREC13, SHREC14, ModelNet10, and ModelNet40, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. It can accelerate the convergence rate significantly while achieving a state-of-the-art recognition performance.

340,346,346,An iterative scheme for the generalized Peierls-Nabarro model based on the inverse Hilbert transform,"A new and efficient semi-analytical iterative scheme is proposed in this work for solving the generalized Peierls-Nabarro model. The numerical method developed here exploits certain basic properties of the Hilbert transform to achieve a reduction of the nonlocal and nonlinear equations characterizing the generalized Peierls-Nabarro model to a local model which is then solved using a fixed point iteration scheme. This is in sharp contrast to existing schemes for solving the generalized Peierls-Nabarro model like the semi-discrete variational Peierls-Nabarro model, or methods involving the fitting of the slip distribution to a linear combination of predefined elementary slip distributions, all of which involve the solution of nonlinear and nonlocal equations using gradient-based optimization tools. The key idea behind the proposed technique is to transform the nonlocal Peierls-Nabarro model into an equivalent local model, called the inverse Peierls-Nabarro model. From a computational viewpoint, the resulting local model is attractive since it can be solved without recourse to any gradient based algorithms; combined with appropriate acceleration schemes, the proposed algorithm provides a computationally expedient alternative to solving the generalized Peierls-Nabarro model. Further, the fixed point iterative scheme developed here easily lends itself to parallelization, unlike iterative methods for the fully nonlocal and nonlinear models currently in use. The proposed numerical scheme is validated both with simple examples involving the 1D Peierls-Nabarro model corresponding to a sinusoidal stacking fault energy, and with realistic examples involving calculations of the core structure of both edge and screw dislocations on the close-packed {111} planes in Aluminum. An approximate technique to incorporate external stresses within the framework of the proposed iterative scheme is also discussed with applications to the equilibration of a dislocation dipole.

349,356,356,A study on self perceptual method of partial auditory disturbance in extended high frequency band,"Excessive use of earphones can overwhelm the auditory system and cause noise deafness in adolescents. Due to the structure and usage of the earphone, there is a high risk of partial auditory disturbance in the extended high frequency band. In adolescents with heavy earphone use, early detection of partial auditory disturbances in the extended high frequency band should be prevented from developing noise deafness. However, the pure tone hearing method below 8KHz, which is a conventional hearing test method, cannot judge partial auditory disturbance of extended high frequency band which may be caused by overuse of earphone. In this study, we propose a method for self perceptual partial auditory disturbance using extended high frequency hearing threshold.

In an experiment involving 18 males and females in their 10s and 20s, 13 were normal and 5 were suspected of partial auditory disturbance.

The proposed grounding system design was used as a grounding system of wind turbine. An ANN model is very preferable due to the complexity of the numerical method to compute Rg and ESP, especially in case of multi-layer soil, in addition, it helps to reduce the computation time. The test data results refer to the ability of the ANN model to substitute the complex software to calculate Rg and ESP.",60107271,Aswan University,Aswan,Egypt,"['1712', '1708', '1705', '1702']",27.25,-0.055769230769230765,0.4365384615384616,1,0.09523809523809523,0.06349206349206349,0.2682926829268293
356,363,363,Effect of cutting parameters on surface roughness in ultra-high precision turning of a contact lens polymer,"This paper studies the effect of cutting parameters on surface generation in ultra-precision turning of a contact lens polymer. Contact lens manufacture wants high accuracy and high surface quality. Surface roughness is mostly used to measure the index quality of a turning process. It has been an important response because it has direct influence toward the part performance and the production cost. Hence, choosing optimal cutting parameters will not only improve the quality measure but also the productivity. This research work is therefore aimed at investigating the effect of cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) on surface roughness of RGP ONSI-56 contact lens polymer with a monocrystalline diamond cutting tool. In this work, cutting speed (A) is found to be the most dominant factor having the highest degree of significance followed by the square of the cutting speed (A2) and the feed rate (B).

359,366,366,Effect of rheology of modified bitumen to the permanent deformation performance of asphalt mixture,"With increasing truck traffic and tire pressure, the excessive permanent deformation or rutting become a major concern in asphalt concrete pavements. Road safety is the main concern of rutting. There is reduced frictional characteristics for vehicles, e.g., wheel path flushing, changing lanes becomes hazardous and water ponds in wheel paths. It is therefore important to characterize the permanent deformation behaviour of asphalt mixes before they are placed in roadways. Improving the characteristic of bitumen can support the ability of asphalt mixture to be more resistant to permanent deformation. This paper focuses on the characteristics of permanent deformation of asphalt mixture with the asphalt modified. Modified bitumen with the natural asphalt Buton of 5, 10 and 15% by weight of base bitumen gave positive results on bitumen stiffness as indicated by decreasing penetration values and softening point, as well as complex shear modulus (G*). The phase angle (Œ¥) decrease that correlated with the resistance of bitumen after modified by Buton Natural Asphalt-Rubber (BNA-R).

The study showed that the stress state of silicon increased with increase in rake angle and decrease in undeformed chip thickness to edge radius ratio. Larger rake angle tool experienced stronger cutting resistance from the workpiece than the smaller rake angle, causing the specific cutting energy (SCE), cutting and thrust forces to increase. There was high kinetic friction at high undeformed chip thickness to edge radius ratio, reducing as the rake angle increases due to increase in thrust forces. The excessive negative effective rake angle at low undeformed chip thickness to edge radius ratio and high rake angle seems to be responsible for increase in phase change at the cutting region, decrease in chip length and thickness, increase in subsurface deformation.",122684622,Nelson Mandela University,Nelson,South Africa,['1706'],30.0,-0.08526315789473687,0.6234210526315791,1,0.10179640718562874,0.017964071856287425,0.17365269461077845

362,369,369,Minimum cost method for multiskilled resource scheduling,"Conventional multiskilled resource scheduling is restricted to immediate resource replacement regardless of whether a resource is worth replacing financially. Furthermore, information is lacking on the extent to which an activity can be expedited or delayed under resource constraints. This study presents an algorithm for multiskilled resource scheduling that aims to enhance the decision process, yield results, and eliminate waste related to resource replacement. The first step addresses the initial solution selected from the lowest scheduling cost among forward-pass and backward-pass calculations. The second step identifies the resource-constrained float, in which an activity can be shifted forward or backward with a guarantee of an adequate resource combination and of meeting the project deadline. The final step uses the given float, which allows for flexibility in adjusting the project schedule to optimise resource replacement. The proposed algorithm is simple and can be calculated manually. It provides a solution that is superior to that of the optimisation approach in the optimal resource replacement step. Furthermore, its advantages can be practically applied in large projects that demand a large number of activities and resources.

The Satras have evolved over a long time and have their ideologies refined over the period. And therefore it becomes pertinent to analyse leadership lessons that can be relevant to the Satra institutions and their longevity. Modern organisations, with all their pomp and show, cannot usually survive beyond hundred years, but Satras have existed for a much more extended period. This study dwells on the Leadership anecdotes relevant to the Satra institutions and on whether based on their efficacy can those lessons be implemented in modern organisations to increase their life expectancy. Several leadership traits and models were in place in the Satra institutions, right from their inception. Decision making was truly democratic and decentralized. These virtues are, today, the hallmark of any successful organization. While profit-oriented organizations aim at financial goals, the Satra Institutions focus on non-economic goals and place the ‚Äúhuman-being‚Äù and his search for God at the center of functioning. This depicts that when a humane approach is the baton of the leadership, they can survive over 400 years, as the Satras have.

First, different types of ROIs are extracted for plaque images. Secondly, according to different ROI regions, the size of the sliding neighborhood block is determined, and the central pixel traverses the plaque region to obtain a small image slice of the plaque developing region. Then, based on PCAnet based on principal component analysis vector as convolution kernel, a clustering PCA network is designed to cluster small image slices and calculate principal component vectors by category to generate multiple sets of convolution kernels. The multi-plaque visualization feature enables the input image to adaptively select the feature extractor to achieve classification recognition of the degree of plaque development. The result of manual labeling by doctors is taken as the standard true value. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively extract the features of plaque developed images and achieve high-efficiency recognition of plaque development.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1700'],26.142857142857146,0.08666666666666667,0.3844444444444444,1,0.14009661835748793,0.01932367149758454,0.2885572139303483

However, IS project control research has not kept pace with current developments in the digital era. Specifically, we find that existing research has been dominated by an underlying agency theory perspective, which is not attuned to salient aspects of current control settings, such as digital innovation initiatives, and thus restricts our understanding of IS project control. To address this shortcoming, we problematize core assumptions underlying existing IS project control research and draw on stewardship theory to present an alternative set of assumptions complementing the prevalent agency theory perspective; introduce the concept of control purpose (why); offer empirical support for its conceptual distinction between value-appropriation and value-creation control purposes; and develop a research agenda that helps move IS project control research into the digital era.",60103124,Bentley University,Waltham,United States,"['1710', '1705']",38.5,0.009090909090909092,0.2409090909090909,0,0.14942528735632185,0.005747126436781609,0.28402366863905326

In order to put the Sound Fire Extinguisher into practical use, it is necessary to increase the efficiency of each component to make it compact and lightweight. Speakers generally allow tens to hundreds of times higher peak power than their permissible RMS power. In this study, we tried to improve the speaker's output efficiency by using the RMS power and peak power characteristics allowed by the speaker. The proposed method is a method of peak power driving of a speaker, which increases the output of a portion of a signal, thereby significantly increasing the peak power compared to the increase of the RMS power. As a result of the experiment of Chapter 4 by the proposed method, the peak power driving signal with double VMAX compared to 60Hz pure tone, the RMS power is increased 2.5 times while the actual sound level is increased 4 times.

387,396,396,Vertical handover decision algorithms in multi-wireless network systems,"The premise of having several network systems consists of different access technologies. Network correspondence happens when two wireless schemes exchange information over the network. A moving cell-phone device could achieve vertical handover operation when receiving signal strength (RSS) from network. Using one of wireless services may interrupt with other service and cause unbalanced network load, or it may cause incompetent vertical handover. This research improves vertical handover decision algorithm for multiple wireless network service. It is preceded with comparing three wireless communication interfaces, which are Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), and Long-Term Evolution (LTE). The study base on three types of priority algorithms to make a vertical handover decision (VHD), they are: equal, mobile, and network priority. VHD algorithms are fundamental segments to the engineering of the anticipated Fourth Generation (4G) heterogeneous wireless networks. These algorithms should be intended to give the required Quality of Service (QoS) to a wide scope of uses while permitting consistent wandering through a host of access network fees. The results show that the proposed algorithm for handover decision calculation beats the customary network decision calculation as far as handover number likelihood and the handover disappointment likelihood.

Especially, the eyes' health is getting worse because it is exposed to various displays such as smartphones and monitors. The amount of eye drops continues to increase and in general, the eye drops are accommodated in the eye drop container having a funnel-shaped container cap. The user bows his/her head with the eyes open and presses the eye drop container to drop the eye drops through the container cap to be injected into the eye. Conventional eye drop containers do not have an indicator for the correct dose, so the patient should simply inject the eye drop by tilting or pressurizing the eye drop depending on the patient's sense. For this reason, chemical liquid is wasted or the effectiveness of the chemical liquid is reduced due to the inability to handle a fixed amount of the chemical liquid. In order to solve this problem, the automatic eye drop dosing device is suggested to detect the position of the user's eye most suitable for the eye drop through the sensor to automatically administer the appropriate amount of eye drops.

The algorithm proposed here is an implementation of a modified cultural algorithm, which uses the genetic algorithm to represent the population space, besides the clique number and the max degree graph formulas are deployed to initialize the belief space. Moreover, the communication protocols between the two spaces (belief and population) are ensured by the best individuals depending on their fitness and number of used colors. The hierarchical clustering is included in the genetic algorithm to verify the similarity between clusters and inside clusters. In the first case, if the similarity between them exceeds a certain rate the two clusters are merged. However in the second case, the cluster is destroyed if the similarity between vertices is less than a certain rate. So, the vertices are distributed between the others clusters. This phase is added after crossover and mutation and it contributes to increase the rate of convergence toward the chromatic number and avoid finishing with a local solution.

The explicit analytical expression for the plate non-linear forced response in the the vinicity of the fundamental mode, obtained in previous works, is substituted in the classical expressions for the acoustic indicators, such as the pressure, the velocity, the impedance, and the efficiency. This leads to new expressions for these indicators involving the effect of the geometrical non-linearity on the plate acoustic radiation indicators. Then, the indicators, computed numerically, have been compared with the corresponding classical linear ones. The comparison between the numerical and analytical results and those available from previous studies showed a good agreement. The results allowed the estimation of the effect of non-linearity on the classical acoustic parameters and showed a higher increase in the acoustic indicators, compared with those predicted by the linear theory.

Hence, they need human resources. The process of human resources management (HRM) starts with planning, for how many and what kind of people will be needed at different points of time in the organisation. Therefore, once employees have been recruited and selected, the next step involved in the HRM process is to transform them to meet the future requirement of the organisation. Such transformation of employees is done by means of training and development. Based on skill requirements for job performance, employees required in an organisation are broadly classified into two categories, viz., operating and supervisory / managerial.

418,428,428,Influence of Von Mises Stress on the Deformation behaviour of a Pinion Spur Gear under Cyclic Loading in a Bottling Machine: An Approach for predicting surface Fatigue failure in Gears,"Fatigue failure predictions using analytical method have become cumbersome due to the types and mode of load applications on the gear teeth. The study employed a simulation approach to predict the fatigue behaviour of a pinion gear under cyclic loading by the determination of the Von Mises stress which can result to Surface deformation. The simulation was carried out on the gear component with emphasis on the teeth at different interval of 60, 90, 120 and 150 seconds using SolidWorks program. The result showed that increased stress resulted to increased deformation. Thus a minimum and maximum Von Mises stress of 1.303e+001 N/mm2 and 7.370e+001 N/mm2 were observed at 60 seconds against the fracture strength of the chosen material, gray cast iron (276 MPa). Further to this, the equivalent minimum and maximum deformation at 60 and 90 seconds were observed to be 7.192e-004 mm, 2.304e-002 mm at 60 seconds and 1.594e-003 mm,2.365e-002 mm at 90 seconds at the tooth respectively. This implies that deformation increases as stress increased and they are both functions of time. Based on the results of these analysis, Von Mises stress and the cyclic loading played an important role in predicting the deformation behaviour of the pinion gear. Thus, it is worthy of note to say that this concept has reduced the rigorous calculations in analytical method of failure predictions.",60103980,Covenant University,Ota,Nigeria,"['1712', '1708', '1705', '1702']",24.777777777777782,-0.0031250000000000093,0.521875,1,0.08979591836734693,0.0653061224489796,0.33195020746887965

424,434,434,High-performance simulation of drug release model using finite element method with cpu/gpu platform," All rights reserved.This paper describes a hybrid CPU/GPU approach for solving a two-phase mathematical model numerically. The dynamic of drug release between the first phase (coating) and second phase (arterial tissue) is represented by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs). The system of equations is discretized by Finite Element Method. The whole discretized system involves a large sparse system of equation which requires a high computation. The CPU/GPU approach provides a platform to solve PDEs having extensive computations in parallel. Consequently, this platform can significantly reduce the solution times as compared to the implementation of CPU. This allows for more efficient investigation of different mathematical models, as well as, the governing parameters. In this paper, a significant parallel computing framework is presented to solve the governing equations numerically using the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) with CUDA. This two-phase model investigates the impact of key parameters related to mass concentrations and drug release from tissue and coating layers. The identification and the role of major parameters such as (Filtration velocity, the ratio of accessible void volume to solid volume, the solid-liquid mass transfer rate) are tinted. Furthermore, the motivation and guidance for using parallel computing in order to handle computational complexities and large sparse system arise after discretizing the model equations are explained.

425,435,435,Damping performance analysis and control of hybrid AC/multi-terminal DC power grids,". All rights reserved.The voltage-source converter (VSC) based multi-terminal direct-current (MTDC) networks are currently being developed in large-scale power grids for efficient and economical transmission of electrical energy generated from remotely sited renewable energy sources (RESs). As the MTDC network is developed alongside the conventional AC grid, it has transformed the power grid to a hybrid AC/MTDC power network. However, since the MTDC network is controlled via the power electronic converters (PECs), it significantly affects the AC power grid damping and synchronising performance as it decouples the natural dynamics between various electro-mechanical systems in the power grid. This paper proposes a supplementary control scheme to improve the damping performance of the entire hybrid AC/MTDC power grid. The damping torque analysis (DTA) technique is used as the primary technique to develop the supplementary control scheme. The preliminary analysis is carried out using a two-terminal hybrid AC/DC power grid and has suggested a supplementary control loop based on the rotor speed deviation for the DC voltage controller of the VSC to improve the damping performance. With the state-space model, the synchronising and damping torque coefficients are calculated and accordingly, the feedback gain is determined to provide optimal synchronising and damping torque components. Subsequently, the fidelity of the supplementary controller is verified using a four-terminal hybrid AC/MTDC grid. Simulation studies prove that the proposed supplementary controller can improve the hybrid AC/MTDC network damping performance, and it performs very effectively with the master-slave control and the conventional droop control scheme.",60011362,RMIT University,Melbourne,Australia,['1700'],24.6,0.12637755102040818,0.4831632653061225,1,0.11920529801324503,0.0695364238410596,0.3235294117647059

427,437,437,"Design of an efficient (m, 3)-adder circuit for implementation of high-performance multipliers","The efficient (m, 3)-adder circuits (4 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 7) are presented in this paper. An (m, 3)-adder adds m bits of the same weight simultaneously and produces 3 outputs: S, C1, C2 such that the binary number (C2 C1 S) represents the number of 1s in the m bits. The (m, 3)-adders are designed to implement a high performance (7, 3)-adder based multiplier. Using (7, 3)-adders, a multiplier can reduce partial products in fewer number of stages than using (3, 2)-adders. The new (m, 3)-adders are faster, smaller, and consume less power than the existing (m, 3)-adder circuits. A 64-bit radix-4 Booth multiplier is designed with the new (m, 3)-adders to estimate the efficiency of the (m, 3)-adders. The multiplier reduces 33 partial products into two 128-bit binary numbers in three (7, 3)-adder-stages and one (3, 2)-adder-stage while the Wallace-tree requires eight stages. In addition, the number of (m, 3)-adders used in the reduction stages is about 1/3 that of (3, 2)-adders used in the Wallace-tree multiplier. Although the (7, 3)-adder has delay 1.7 times larger and consumes power 1.3 times more than a (3, 2)-adder, reduction of the partial products with the (7, 3)-adders is about 24% faster and consumes power 50% less than reducing by the (3, 2)-adders.

El contrato de cero horas en el trabajo en plataformas digitales ¬øDebe prohibirse o aceptarse?," All rights reserved.The aim of the paper is to analyze the zero-hour contract in the context of platform work; specifically, the risks and opportunities of this type of provision of services. In the context of the sharing economy and gig-economy, there have emerged multiple App-based companies that have significantly altered the way in which services are provided. Companies like Uber, Lift, Taskrabbit, Deriveroo, Glovo or Amazon Mechanical Turk have introduced new forms of work that have altered the boundaries of Labor Law. The model of these companies is the division of their production into microtasks, the externalization of their entire production to a wide number of independent contractors through an App or webpage and the hiring of each service on-demand. As a result, new technologies have allowed these companies to avoid hiring workers and to provide their services entirely through self-employed workers. This hiring on-demand implies the use, de facto, of the zero-hour contract, as platform workers are not subject to a specific working time regime, having absolute liberty to determine, not only their schedule, but also their working time and, even, their willingness to work. In this context, the aim of the paper is to analyze the zero-hour scheme in the context of platform work.

429,439,439,Analysis of Experiments on Statistical and Neural Parsing for a Morphologically Rich and Free Word Order Language Urdu,"This article presents an analysis of experiments with statistical and neural parsing techniques for Urdu, a widely spoken South Asian language. We demonstrate state of the art constituency parsing results for an Urdu treebank. Urdu is a morphologically rich and is characterized by free word order. Language representation (e.g. input type, lemmatization, word clusters), part of speech tag set, phrase labels and the size of a training corpus are crucial for parsing such languages. In this article, probabilistic context-free grammars, data-oriented parsing, and recursive neural network based models have been experimented with several linguistic features which show improvements in the parsing results. Features include syntactic sub-categorization of POS tags, empirically learned horizontal and vertical markovizations and lexical head words. These features enable dependency information for case markers and add phrasal and lexical context to the parse trees. The data-oriented parsing and recursive neural network model give an f-score of 87.1 by considering gold POS tags in the test set, on textual input, they show a performance with f-scores of 83.4 and 84.2, respectively. To overcome the issue of data sparsity due to the morphological richness, lemmatization and unsupervised word clustering have been performed. A treebank should cover most probable word orders of the language so that models can learn various orders accurately. To analyze the order coverage of the treebank and learning capability of different parsers, a test set has been prepared conditioning different word orders. This test set is evaluated with the best performing parsing models and with gold POS tags, f-scores are above 90 and on textual input, the average f-score is 87.6.",60056462,University of Engineering and Technology Lahore,Lahore,Pakistan,['1700'],20.384615384615387,0.13157894736842107,0.4083333333333333,1,0.10610932475884244,0.028938906752411574,0.34459459459459457

Graph-based method is one of main clustering approaches and has been shown impressive performance in many literatures. The core issue of graph-based clustering is how to construct a good adjacency graph. A large number of works employ the sparse representation of data as the similarity measure by ‚Ñì1 regularization. However, due to the flat nature of the ‚Ñì1 norm, such methods solve the sparse representation of each data point individually, which do not take into account the global structure of data. To exploit the global and essential structure in data, in contrast to existing methods, we propose to learn a graph with group sparsity. To incorporate more information into the graph, we also use the manifold regularization with adaptive similarity during the process of group sparse self-representation. The resulting model is handled by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Further, we employ Iterative Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm and threshold operator to solve the ADMM subproblems.

As such, they operate as curatorial agents of platforms‚Äô content, establishing what is there to see, know and consume. This state of affairs calls for a revision of the traditional role of the (human) curator who is confronted with an online environment characterised by the unprecedented collision of commercial, aesthetic, cultural and political interests.

These results, so called quantum supremacy, however, do not rule out possibilities of super-polynomial-time classical simulations. In this paper, we study ‚Äúfine-grained‚Äù version of quantum supremacy that excludes some exponential-time classical simulations. First, we focus on two sub-universal models, namely, the one-clean-qubit model (or the DQC1 model) and the HC1Q model. Assuming certain conjectures in fine-grained complexity theory, we show that for any a > 0 output probability distributions of these models cannot be classically sampled within a constant multiplicative error and in 2(1‚àía)N+o(N) time, where N is the number of qubits. Next, we consider universal quantum computing.

Unlike conventional approaches, our proposed method implements an enhanced STAP with optimal Antenna-Pulse Selection (APS) that reduces space-time subspace training impulse requirement for clutter covariance matrix estimation. To perform optimal APS provision at first we have performed Space Spectrum Correlation Coefficient (SSCC) estimation, which has been further processed for the optimal Antenna-Impulse Pair Selection that approximates clutter covariance matrix to achieve enhanced Signal-to-Clutter plus Noise Ratio (SCNR). Here, the use of SSCC helps achieving optimal separation between target signal and clutter subspace or allied clutter Fourier basis. Additionally, it suppresses jamming and noise power components that eventually assist enabling accurate moving target detection. Thus, the proposed method justifies its robustness not only towards moving target detection under sea-clutter by suppressing clutter subspace, but also alleviates the problem of jamming. Hence, it enables secure, reliable and efficient moving target detection under sea-clutter. The overall proposed model has been developed based on impulse radar setup using MATLAB tool where, multiple moving targets are detected for the received signal impulses. The proposed method can be a potential solution for multiple moving target detection even under heterogeneous environment containing clutter, jamming attacks, noise and other interferences.

Several computer vision applications require an efficient detection stage. A reliable motion detection system should work under a wide range of a variety of scenes and various acquisition conditions. In this paper, a new approach to detect moving objects boundaries in an image sequence is presented. The proposed approach is based on the frame differing of modified Haynes technique combined with a biologically inspired spiking neural network for boundaries detection. First, the detection of temporal changes consists in extracting the moving objects between two consecutive frames in a dynamic scene without any estimate of the optical flow, nor any priory on the stage as the background image. The main goal is to get a fast and effective detection. In order to obtain a motion boundaries information, the extracted moving objects are then presented to a spiking neural network based on the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model whose responses can form a complete closed curve coinciding with the motion object boundaries. Simulation results in some experiments are satisfactory.

476,492,492,Basi—Ås of hybrid energy-metallurgical and catalytic technology of synthetic methane production,"In this paper, we considered the approach to reducing the level of GHGs emissions below the limit, which the reduction reaction of iron oxides by carbon determines. We have shown this is possible if a part of the gases (CO) leaving the metallurgical unit will be processed into synthetic methane or other commercial chemical products. For this purpose the metallurgical unit of continuous action is necessary. We looked at the physical-chemical basis of operation of such a unit on the basis of smelting reduction (SR) in an electric arc furnace. In this unit, a mixture of powders of stoichiometric composition from iron ore magnetite concentrate and coal is fed through the tuyeres deepened to the bottom of the metal bath by injection (CO is the injecting gas). These tuyeres are located under the electrodes. As a result, a reaction zone occurs in a metal bath (low carbon steel) in each cylindrical region that extends from the tuyere to the electrode. In this reaction zone, FeO dissolves in a metal bath (without slag formation) and is reduced by solid carbon particles, which float up. The mathematical model of this process is created. For the reaction zone under consideration, an equation for calculating the productivity (relative to the mass of reduced iron) was obtained. The calculation results show that a metallurgical unit with 6 reaction zones (6 electrodes in an electric arc installation) with a total volume of a metal bath (including all 6 reaction zones) of about 16 m3 has a design capacity of about 411 t/h of an iron-carbon product (low-carbon steel with a carbon content of about 0.2 %).

The risk become much higher in poor society (for example, refugee camps). Hence, it is crucial to have a low cost and smart system that is able to detect and to react when a threat is present. The main focus of the presented scheme is to design and implement a low cast smart hazardous gas detecting system. The proposed design is controlled through Arduino, which in turn is connected to gas and temperature sensors. Furthermore, the Arduino is connected to suitable alarm, warning devices and elements with the ability to take appropriate actions when needed, thus a complete gas detection and alarm smart system is established. The proposed implementation detects the concentration of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in the surrounding air, and measure the temperature; based upon these factors the device will act accordingly. A sensor is incorporated to indicate the concentration of the gas via a unique relationship between the concentration of the gas and the conductivity of the sensor material. The later signal is then processed using an analog to digital converter in the Arduino. Then the concentration and the temperature will be displayed on the GUI (Graphical User Interface) that is manipulated by LabVIEW program. The device is modeled to include 6 different stages of the concentration of LPG and 1 level of temperature, each stage can be modified and has its own based upon actions. The device is tested against some threats like those resulting from LPG stoves which are widely used and successfully detects and react accordingly.",60044088,Hashemite University,Zarqa,Jordan,"['1712', '1708', '1705', '1702']",23.75,0.1978663003663004,0.5471886446886447,1,0.14603174603174604,0.044444444444444446,0.24761904761904763

Coprocessing of vacuum gasoil (VGO) with palm triglyceride fatty acid has been performed experimentally using fluid-bed reactor of ACE unit over equilibrium catalyst of single REY-type zeolite at reaction temperature 530oC and catalyst-oil ratio of 5.5 g/g. Three kind of cracking feeds were tested and evaluated including neat VGO, mixture of VGO with 0-15% refined bleached deodorized palm oil (RBDPO) and VGO mixed with 0-15% of RBDPO and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) at ratio 9:1. It was found that cracking feeds containing palm triglyceride fatty acid influenced significantly the product yield and conversion. The change of gasoline yield from 42.9 to 48.3% and octane number from 92.4 to 97.7 was found from coprocessing of VGO with 5% RBDPO-PFAD. The role of palm triglyceride fatty acid along with VGO feed was suppossed to be dominantly in strengthening the cracking ability as indicated by increase of strong acid sites of catalyst from action of hydrogen transfer reaction.

Due to the increasingly significant influence algorithmic processes have on visual media, there has been an expansion of the possibilities as to how images may behave, and a consequent struggle to define them. This algorithmic turn highlights inner tensions within existing notions of the image, namely raising questions regarding the autonomy of machines, author-and viewer-ship, and the veracity of representations. In this sense, algorithmic images hover uncertainly between human and machine as producers and interpreters of visual information, between representational and non-representational, and between visible surface and the processes behind it. This paper gives an introduction to fundamental internal discrepancies which arise within algorithmically produced images, examined through a selection of relevant artistic examples.

However, the telecommunication market has reached a point of saturation and it is, in general very difficult for a company to bring a new customer. On the other hand, mobile number portability has become very easy. This has resulted in an ever-increased concept of churn, whereby a customer moves from one service provider to another. It is very important for telecommunication companies to predict which of the customers are most susceptible to move to their competitors. One can predict this move based on Call Detail Records (CDR). CDRs have features such as last call date, duration of a call, and data usage. Deep Learning is a relatively recent concept and has found many applications in pattern recognition, image processing, and other related domains. As such, in this research, we apply deep learning for churn prediction. For evaluation and analysis, we use the Mobile Telephony Churn Prediction Dataset.

In order to realize sustainable development, it is necessary to carry out government buildings that implement the integration of technical, economic, social and environmental aspects effectively through green buildings. Green buildings have measurable performance in saving energy, water and other resources. Green buildings of government buildings require effective and efficient maintenance and repair management to maintain the reliability of buildings and their facilities and infrastructure so that they are always worthy of functions both in terms of safety, health, comfort and convenience. The development of technology and information systems has led to the concept of e-maintenance which combines the principles of maintenance, web services and the principles of modern electronic collaboration. E-maintenance combined with Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and integrated with Building Information Modeling (BIM) will improve the building maintenance and repair process that is precise, accurate, fast and easy.

Among the many new AI studies, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) played the biggest role, and it is thought that game AI can solve almost any problem if given ample learning opportunities. In this study, we propose ways to expand and improve the approach currently used in the general video game AI research aimed at solving various video games that are frequently encountered by ordinary people in real time without pre-learning. This approach suggested that, within the framework of adding a progressive history to MCTS, which is the latest method currently used, the parameters that most affect MCTS' problem pool characteristics can be dynamically converted as the game progresses, thereby demonstrating progress over the existing static method. The specific optimal values of the reset cycle, the pre-emption period, and the delay interval to determine this dynamic change will depend on the type of game to be applied or its specific characteristics, so further studies such as how to confirm it in the future are thought to be necessary, but it is certain that performance can be improved relative to the static method just by using the appropriate values determined through the experiment.",60012704,Kyungpook National University,Daegu,South Korea,"['1712', '1708', '1705', '1702']",48.4,0.05514485514485516,0.4671189921189922,1,0.13382899628252787,0.048327137546468404,0.2490566037735849

However, these networks are continually subjected to extreme threats such as disruptive events either due to climate change impacts or other man-made accumulated stresses, which makes them more and more vulnerable. Resilient systems involve being able to predict, adapt to, respond to, and recover from such disruptive events. Cities, worldwide have initiated different tools and frameworks to assess their urban resilience against different shocks and stresses. The process of assessing urban resilience involves complimentary functions of urban risk analysis and resilience capacities. In such process, risk analysis adopts a bottom-up approach while resilience capacity assessment follows a top-down approach.

In this work, we investigate limitations imposed by built-in camera downsizing methods and tackle the question of how to obtain a camera ID so that attribution is possible with lower resolution media. For this purpose, we developed an application that gathers photos and videos at all supported resolutions by controlling camera settings. Analysis of media obtained from 21 smartphone and tablet cameras shows that downsizing of photos by a factor of 4 or higher suppresses PRNU pattern significantly.

514,531,531,Microwave Imaging of Non-Rigid Moving Target Using 2D Sparse MIMO Array,"This paper develops a microwave/mmw (millimeter-wave) imaging method for moving objects of non-rigid body which can be used in the heavy traffic scenarios. This method is proposed with a 2D sparse MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) array composed of two orthogonal linear arrays. In comparison to the RX antennas, a smaller number of TX antennas is used to decrease the data acquisition time of this system when using TDM (time division multiplexing) signal transmitting technique. The 2D sparse MIMO array is deployed with wide-band signals transmitted to reconstruct the backscattering coefficient in 3D space using synthetic aperture imaging technique. Then a series of synthesized 3D snapshot images are generated during the motion of the target. The non-rigid human body target is decomposed into 25 joints tracked by an optical device which is Kinect in this paper. After the decomposition, the movement of each joint can be described as a space-time trajectory tracked by Kinect, providing a preliminary indication of the 3D position of each joint. With the indication, we divide every microwave/mmw image into 25 sub-images corresponding to the joints' position to form an image sequence of each joint. Subsequently, a segmental joint estimation method is proposed to estimate the accurate motion parameters of each joint from the image sequence. The decorrelation of the images in large angle observation can be significantly reduced by the segmental estimation which leads global optimized motion parameters. Consequently, the estimated parameters are taken into the effective movement compensation of each component. Meanwhile, the image refocusing method is presented to generate the well-focused image of each component. Finally, all the images of components are fused into one image of the whole target to reconstruct the 3D high-resolution image.

516,533,533,Distortion-minimizing injective maps between surfaces,"The problem of discrete surface parametrization, i.e. mapping a mesh to a planar domain, has been investigated extensively. We address the more general problem of mapping between surfaces. In particular, we provide a formulation that yields a map between two disk-topology meshes, which is continuous and injective by construction and which locally minimizes intrinsic distortion. A common approach is to express such a map as the composition of two maps via a simple intermediate domain such as the plane, and to independently optimize the individual maps. However, even if both individual maps are of minimal distortion, there is potentially high distortion in the composed map. In contrast to many previous works, we minimize distortion in an end-to-end manner, directly optimizing the quality of the composed map. This setting poses additional challenges due to the discrete nature of both the source and the target domain. We propose a formulation that, despite the combinatorial aspects of the problem, allows for a purely continuous optimization. Further, our approach addresses the non-smooth nature of discrete distortion measures in this context which hinders straightforward application of off-the-shelf optimization techniques. We demonstrate that, despite the challenges inherent to the more involved setting, discrete surface-to-surface maps can be optimized effectively.",60016653,Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Aachen,Germany,['1704'],18.454545454545453,0.1075776397515528,0.4219772256728779,1,0.08641975308641975,0.0,0.2807017543859649
517,534,534,Selectively metropolised Monte Carlo light transport simulation,"Light transport is a complex problem with many solutions. Practitioners are now faced with the difficult task of choosing which rendering algorithm to use for any given scene. Simple Monte Carlo methods, such as path tracing, work well for the majority of lighting scenarios, but introduce excessive variance when they encounter transport they cannot sample (such as caustics). More sophisticated rendering algorithms, such as bidirectional path tracing, handle a larger class of light transport robustly, but have a high computational overhead that makes them inefficient for scenes that are not dominated by difficult transport. The underlying problem is that rendering algorithms can only be executed indiscriminately on all transport, even though they may only offer improvement for a subset of paths. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme for selectively combining different Monte Carlo rendering algorithms. We use a simple transport method (e.g. path tracing) as the base, and treat high variance ""freflies"" as seeds for a Markov chain that locally uses a Metropolised version of a more sophisticated transport method for exploration, removing the frefly in an unbiased manner. We use a weighting scheme inspired by multiple importance sampling to partition the integrand into regions the base method can sample well and those it cannot, and only use Metropolis for the latter. This constrains the Markov chain to paths where it offers improvement, and keeps it away from regions already handled well by the base estimator. Combined with stratified initialization, short chain lengths and careful allocation of samples, this vastly reduces non-uniform noise and temporal flickering artifacts normally encountered with a global application of Metropolis methods. Through careful design choices, we ensure our algorithm never performs much worse than the base estimator alone, and usually performs significantly better, thereby reducing the need to experiment with different algorithms for each scene.",60010756,Dartmouth College,Hanover,United States,['1704'],25.16666666666667,-0.026038961038961046,0.6202102659245516,1,0.12941176470588237,0.023529411764705882,0.2536873156342183

519,536,536,Comparing approaches for quality evaluation of software engineering experiments: An empirical study on software product line experiments," Furtado, Henrique Vignando, Victor Franca and Edson OliveiraJr.The Software Engineering (SE) research area must provide results of a certain quality for the sake of value. High quality research results may ensure experience and knowledge, which are essential for the technology to be transferred to the industry. One of the means to obtain such quality results is experimentation. Experimentation is a scientific method that aims to provide evidence of a theory over real-world observations establishing a cause-effect relation. Well conducted, auditable and repeatable experiments are vital for scientific evolution and novelty. Quality evaluation of controlled experiments and quasi-experiments in SE has been recently discussed in the literature as researchers desire to assess whether such experiments have improved by reporting information that enables the experiments to be replicated and the reader can understand the experiment and validate results. Thus, this work empirically compares four approaches for quality evaluation of SE experiments in the context of Software Product Lines (SPL). In addition, we are interested on verifying the quality of reporting experiments in a well-discussed reuse technique as SPL. The Pearson technique supported the correlation between pairs of evaluation approaches. In addition, the T-Test and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U test were applied to the samples to verify whether there was a difference in the quality of experiments when using an experimental template. Preliminary results show a strong positive correlation between them, the hypothesis tests confirmed there is such a difference in quality when using experimental template and the SPL experiments report more the planning phase than the analysis and interpretation phase. Based on our results, we provide initial evidence two approaches are the best to reporting SPL experiments.",60029498,Universidade Estadual de Maringa,Maringa,Brazil,"['1712', '1705', '1702']",22.83333333333333,0.19916065416065415,0.4466786916786918,0,0.1111111111111111,0.07301587301587302,0.34563758389261745

Although this topic was examined by many researcher‚Äôs around the globe, few studies were conducted in Jordan to address the impact of weather on traffic conditions. The objectives of this study look into the relationship between weather conditions and traffic operating conditions on the 6-lane divided arterial streets in suburban area in the vicinity of Amman, Jordan. The posted speed limits vary from 80 to 100 km/h. The study looked into the impact of environmental conditions including lighting conditions, timing (day of the week and time of the day) on traffic conditions and to develop related models. Traffic data and weather data were collected including temperature, rainfall, wind speed and humidity for two months (November and December). Traffic data on traffic volume and traffic speed are collected. The statistical analysis includes descriptive statistics and inferential statistics and generalized models were used. Traffic speed on wet conditions is higher than when it is dry, the difference in speeds increase as speed limits increase. As rain precipitation depth increases the speed decreases. The strength of the association between traffic flow indicators (speed and volume) differ by the depth of rain precipitation. Air temperature and wind speed influence negatively the relationship between speed and volumes. The impact of temperature seems more influential on traffic volumes. Speed at night is higher than day time and it found is statistically different.

East Java Province is a province with potential agricultural in Indonesia. East Java has advantages in agriculture and has a role in the national food sector. Population in Indonesia is projected to reach 271.1 million by 2020. East Java's population growth rate from 2010 to 2017 was 0.64% with consumption of 213,783 tons of rice in 2018. Raw materials such as paddy, are perishable materials that require fast and precise handling. When handling is not right it will cause a loss of the results of high quality and quantity, this can be harmful to farmers because it will affect their income. This study uses a system dynamic to build the conceptual model (Causal Loop Diagram) to improving the quality of paddy yields to support food security. The results of study are a model that has some useful information regarding factors that affect the quality paddy.

524,541,541,Mandoline: Robust cut-cell generation for arbitrary triangle meshes,"Although geometry arising ""in the wild"" most often comes in the form of a surface representation, a plethora of geometrical and physical applications require the construction of volumetric embeddings either of the geometry itself or the domain surrounding it. Cartesian cut-cell-based mesh generation provides an attractive solution in which volumetric elements are constructed from the intersection of the input surface geometry with a uniform or adaptive hexahedral grid. This choice, especially common in computational fluid dynamics, has the potential to efficiently generate accurate, surface-conforming cells; unfortunately, current solutions are often slow, fragile, or cannot handle many common topological situations. We therefore propose a novel, robust cut-cell construction technique for triangle surface meshes that explicitly computes the precise geometry of the intersection cells, even on meshes that are open or non-manifold. Its fundamental geometric primitive is the intersection of an arbitrary segment with an axisaligned plane. Beginning from the set of intersection points between triangle mesh edges and grid planes, our bottom-up approach robustly determines cut-edges, cut-faces, and finally cut-cells, in a manner designed to guarantee topological correctness. We demonstrate its effectiveness and speed on a wide range of input meshes and grid resolutions, and make the code available as open source.",60018491,Simon Fraser University,Burnaby,Canada,['1704'],28.714285714285715,0.08499999999999999,0.5638095238095239,1,0.09016393442622951,0.004098360655737705,0.2610619469026549

Firstly, algorithms were trained on samples from 20 users, and achieved a validation accuracy of 83% for Inception-v1 and 75% for Inception-v3. In terms of Equal Error Rates (EER), Inception-v1 managed to obtain an EER as low as 17 for 20 users; while EER for Inception-v3 with 20 users obtained 24, which is a good measure compared to prior works in the literature. Although Inception-v3 has performed better in the ImageNet image classification challenge, in the case of 2D images of signatures, Inception-v1 has performed the classification task better than Inception-v3 It is also acknowledged in this study that Inception-v1 spent less time training, as it had a lower number of operations compared to Inception-v3.",60090601,"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur",Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia,['1700'],29.285714285714285,0.1834313725490196,0.4494117647058823,1,0.06923076923076923,0.06538461538461539,0.47058823529411764
526,543,543,DReCon: Data-driven responsive control of physics-based characters,"Interactive control of self-balancing, physically simulated humanoids is a long standing problem in the ield of real-time character animation. While physical simulation guarantees realistic interactions in the virtual world, simulated characters can appear unnatural if they perform unusual movements in order to maintain balance. Therefore, obtaining a high level of responsiveness to user control, runtime performance, and diversity has often been overlooked in exchange for motion quality. Recent work in the ield of deep reinforcement learning has shown that training physically simulated characters to follow motion capture clips can yield high quality tracking results. We propose a two-step approach for building responsive simulated character controllers from unstructured motion capture data. First, meaningful features from the data such as movement direction, heading direction, speed, and locomotion style, are interactively speciied and drive a kinematic character controller implemented using motion matching. Second, reinforcement learning is used to train a simulated character controller that is general enough to track the entire distribution of motion that can be generated by the kinematic controller.

534,551,551,Application of improved genetic algorithm in function optimization," All rights reserved.In recent years, due to the great potential of genetic algorithms to solve complex optimization problems, it has attracted wide attention. But the traditional genetic algorithm still has some shortcomings. In this paper, a new adaptive genetic algorithm (NAGA) is proposed to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional genetic algorithm (GA). GA algorithm is easy to fall into the local optimal solution and converges slowly in the process of function optimization. NAGA algorithm takes into accounts the diversity of the population fitness, the crossover probability and mutation probability of the nonlinear adaptive genetic algorithm. In order to speed up the optimization efficiency, the introduced selection operator is combined with the optimal and worst preserving strategies in the selection operator. And in order to keep the population size constant during the genetic operation, the strategy of preserving the parents is proposed. Compared with the classical genetic algorithm GA and IAGA, the improved genetic algorithm is easier to get rid of the extremum and find a better solution in solving the multi-peak function problem, and the convergence rate is faster. Therefore, the improved genetic algorithm is beneficial for function optimization and other optimization problems.",60001429,Shandong University of Science and Technology,Qingdao,China,"['1712', '1709', '1708', '1703']",21.66666666666667,-0.004723707664884136,0.5041889483065953,0,0.09049773755656108,0.03619909502262444,0.2824074074074074

538,555,555,Decentralized algorithm for repeating pattern formation by multiple robots,"Recently, much attention is paid to multi-robot systems due to their widespread applications such as warehouse robotics, persistent surveillance, and exploration of unknown environments. Although urgently required by the applications, coordination among multiple robots remains to be challenging. Among the problems of multi-robot coordination, pattern formation serves a fundamental one. It aims to control a group of robots to form a desired shape with some certain goals such as best formation quality, minimum makespan or minimum total distance. Existing works mainly focus on the formation of certain patterns, such as repeating squares or a circle.Those approaches cannot be generalized to arbitrary pattern formation. In this paper, we propose a decentralized algorithm for a multi-robot system to generate a given formation with an arbitrary repeating pattern. We introduce basic pattern graph and assembling graph to define a repeating pattern and formation quality for measurement.

539,556,556,An edge-Assisted vehicle routing method based on game-Theoretic multiagent learning,"Traffic congestion is a serious social issue confronting modern cities. To improve traffic efficiency, route planning for the individual vehicle based on dynamic traffic conditions has been well investigated. However, existing studies usually model the vehicles with perfect rationality and omit the complex routing interaction among multiple vehicles, causing that the routing performance dramatically deviates from the system optimum. Considering the mutual influence in multi-vehicle routing, we propose an edge-Assisted distributed routing framework, which enables virtual agents on behalf of vehicles to interact with others to make real-Time routing decisions. In the framework, we model the agent interaction as a population game and propose a scalable multiagent learning algorithm to efficiently find the Nash equilibria. Specifically, the multiagent learning algorithm takes the bounded rationality of individuals into account and uses a stage learning algorithm based on best-response dynamics to plan a route for vehicles. The simulation results show that the algorithm efficiently converges to Nash equilibria, and achieves the maximum throughput at the intersection and the minimum average travel time for vehicles.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,['1708'],24.57142857142857,0.04166666666666666,0.4125,1,0.1641025641025641,0.015384615384615385,0.28342245989304815

543,560,560,The role of opinions and ideas as types of tacit knowledge,"Purpose: The paper identifies the difficulties associated with managing tacit knowledge in its entirety among distributed individuals and proposes its categorization into types/kinds as a solution for its effective externalization and measurement. The categorization process implies the identification of those types or kinds of tacit knowledge which could be externalized and measured easier than others. The paper posits that such categorization is a step in the right direction for better tacit-to-explicit transformation. Design: The paper is designed based on literary evidences supporting that some parts or instances of tacit knowledge could be more easily externalized/transformed into explicit form than other forms. This research through the analysis of opinions and ideas focuses on building up the relationship between tacit knowledge and these two constructs. The paper will introduce a comparative analysis between opinions and ideas and tacit knowledge. Findings: The relationships and correspondences between opinions/ideas and tacit knowledge are developed and a Reflection-articulation-interpretation model which demonstrates these relationships and the externalization to explicit knowledge. Practical implications: The introduced relationships between Tacit Knowledge Instances, Opinions and Ideas as well as the externalization model form the basis for proper tacit knowledge externalization based on its categorization. The authors believe that if tacit knowledge is categorized into types, this will have positive effects on improved tacit knowledge externalization.

In this paper, we have presented a fuzzy-based feature extraction technique, named fuzzy generalized two-dimensional Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FG-2DLDA) method. The FG-2DLDA is extended version of the G-2DFLD method. In this study, we also have demonstrated the face recognition using the presented method with radial basis function (RBF) as a classifier. In this context, it is to be noted that the fuzzy membership matrix for the training samples is computed by means of fuzzy k-nearest neighbour (Fk-NN) algorithm. The global mean and class-wise mean training images are generated by combining the fuzzy membership values with the training samples. These mean images are used to compute the fuzzy intra- and inter-class scatter matrices along x- and y-directions. Finally, by solving the Eigen value problems of these scatter matrices, we find the optimal fuzzy projection vectors, which actually used to generate more discriminant features.

549,567,567,Research of additive iteration step sizes for SinMF," All rights reserved.NMF has been extensively applied on various pattern recognition problems, including face recognition. To enhance the performance of NMF for face recognition, new additive iterative step sizes are proposed for the basic NMF method, which can raise the searching accuracy during the iteration, and then the recognition rate can be improved. The improved NMF method is named INMF. Meanwhile, the experiments results show that the proposed improved additive iteration can also raise the recognition rate of the SNMF and WNMF. Besides, we find that no sparse constraint is applied to INMF and lots of redundant information still exists, thus a threshold-sparse constraint is introduced to make the base matrix W to a 0-1 matrix, and then the feature data of the base matrix become sparse, therefore the recognition rate can be further improved. The INMF model with the threshold-sparse constraint is named SINMF. Finally, our extensive experimental results showed that the highest recognition rate of the SINMF method can achieve 99%, with improvement over the INMF, IWNMF, ISNMF and deep NMF methods by 11%, 5.5%, 11% and 8%, respectively.

Benchmarking E-apps for young learners is challenging due to (a) multiple criteria, (b) criteria importance and (c) data variation. The DM was constructed on the basis of the intersection amongst evaluation criteria in terms of LSRW and E-apps for young learners. The criteria were adopted from a preschool education curriculum standard. The DM data included six E-apps as alternatives and 17 skills as criteria. Thereafter, the six E-apps were evaluated by distributing a checklist form amongst six English learning experts. These apps were subsequently benchmarked by utilising MCDM methods, namely, best-worst method (BWM) and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). BWM was used for criterion weighting, whereas TOPSIS was employed to benchmark and rank the apps. TOPSIS was utilised in two contexts, namely, individual and group. In the group context, internal and external aggregations are applied. Mean was computed to ensure that the E-apps undergo a systematic ranking for objective validation. This study provides scenarios and a benchmarking checklist to evaluate and compare the proposed work with six relative studies. Results indicated that (1) BWM is suitable for criteria weighting. (2) TOPSIS is suitable for benchmarking and ranking E-apps. Moreover, the internal and external TOPSIS group decision making exhibited similar findings, with the best app being 'Montessori' and the worst app being 'FunWithFlupe.'

To reduce the damage of cyber attacks, existing techniques have been proposed to predict the potential risk of external attacks at the level of an enterprise, a user, or a machine.

This is very challenging due to the numerous channel coefficients to be estimated over the time-varying channel and the channel estimation of a wireless signal transmission to be considered for compressive sampling. In a typical communication system, the signal is sampled at least twice at the highest frequency contained in the signal. However, this limits efficient ways to compress the signal, as it places a huge burden on sampling the entire signal while only a small number of the transform coefficients are needed to represent the signal. To tackle this problem, we will focused on a mathematical optimization problem for the most efficient compressed sensing method called \ell-{1}-norm, known as Basis Pursuit.

In particular, they share spectral approximation properties with eigenfunctions, offering a good compromise between computational complexity and accuracy. Their construction involves only linear algebra and follows a fine-to-coarse approach, leading to a block-diagonalization of the stiffness matrix where each block corresponds to an intermediate scale space of the elastic object. Once this hierarchy has been precomputed, we can simulate an object at runtime on very coarse resolution grids and still capture the correct physical behavior, with orders of magnitude speedup compared to a fine simulation. We show on a variety of heterogeneous materials that our approach outperforms all previous coarse-graining methods for elasticity.",60117933,"State Key Lab of CAD&amp;CG, Zhejiang University",Hangzhou,China,['1704'],29.0,0.12083333333333332,0.3779761904761905,1,0.11386138613861387,0.0,0.2789473684210526
560,579,579,Dither Filtering of Real RLG Signal Using Wavelet Transforms,"Abstract‚Äî: Ring Laser Gyroscopes (RLGs) are widely used in many airborne and navigation systems for accurate measurement of the true rotation of the body movement. But the RLG‚Äôs suffer a serious problem at low frequencies known as Lock‚Äìin frequency. To avoid lock-in problem, the RLG is vibrated mechanically to a high frequency which is known as Dithering. In order to get the true rotation of the body the dither signal has to be removed. Single stage, multistage and multirate filters are suggested to remove the dither signal. These filters have the disadvantage that either the FIR filter length is too large or the phase characteristics are nonlinear. In this work, multiresolution Wavelet Transform (WT) techniques are used to remove the dither signal. Five level multiresolution analysis is carried out with various types of wavelets like Discrete Meyer and Daubechies 45 (db45) etc. With none of the standard wavelets, the original and reconstructed signals are matched. A new wavelet is designed to remove the dither signal. The required signal can be reconstructed back using the approximation coefficients at level 5. The dither signal is attenuated by 107.0 dB, and the phase characteristics are found to be linear in the pass band. The computational complexity is also less compared to the three stage combined filter reported earlier.",60094091,"Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology, Hyderabad",Hyderabad,India,['1700'],16.53846153846154,0.10671886936592816,0.4267099567099567,1,0.1016260162601626,0.06910569105691057,0.33884297520661155
561,580,580,Fstream: Flexible stream scheduling and prioritizing in multipath-quic,"While the web keeps evolving, web latency remains a major obstacle to improving user experience. In the past, many efforts have been made in this course. SPDY achieves reduced latency through multiplexing and prioritization by manipulating HTTP. Quick UDP Internet Connection (QUIC) generalizes the idea and embeds multiplexing in the transport layer by introducing application-oriented streams. Multipath-QUIC brings further improvements by utilizing multiple paths as is done in MultiPath TCP (MPTCP). However, failing to account for stream priorities in the transport layer can result in suboptimal performance for time-critical streams. We fill this gap and propose FStream-a flexible stream scheduling mechanism for Multipath-QUIC, which provides stream prioritization down to the transport layer. We implement FStream in Multipath-QUIC and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the completion time of time-critical streams (3x) through extensive experiments under different path dissimilarity conditions.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1708'],17.25,0.0544753086419753,0.3858024691358025,1,0.14705882352941177,0.08823529411764706,0.4230769230769231

565,584,584,Mitigating Both Data Corruption and Content Replay Attacks with Implicit Data Integrity,"We study the security of the recently proposed implicit integrity methodology. Implicit integrity is a novel methodology that supports corruption detection without producing, storing or verifying mathematical summaries of the content such as MACs or ICVs, as typically done today. The main idea behind implicit integrity is that, whereas typical user data demonstrate patterns such as repeated bytes or words, decrypted data resulting from corrupted ciphertexts no longer demonstrate such patterns. Thus, by checking the entropy of decrypted ciphertexts, corruption can be possibly detected. Past contributions to the implicit integrity methodology have focused on observed patterns on client and server data that motivate the methodology, entropy definitions for arbitrarily small messages, and constructions that mitigate data corruption attacks. In this paper, we extend the known analytical results concerning implicit integrity addressing content replay attacks as well. We demonstrate that the class of cryptographic constructions known as 'random oracles according to observer functions', which has been proposed for mitigating data corruption attacks, is actually simultaneously secure under two different adversary models: an input perturbing adversary performing content corruption attacks, and an oracle replacing adversary performing content replay attacks.",60033010,Intel Corporation,Santa Clara,United States,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",26.714285714285715,-0.07291666666666666,0.4520833333333333,1,0.15311004784688995,0.009569377990430622,0.33653846153846156

However, due to the diversity of traffic patterns, the traditional network with fixed topology may achieve good performance under some applications, while performs poorly under other forms. Network reconfiguration technologies which can change the topology dynamically have been developed to obtain a balanced performance for different traffic patterns. Nonetheless, selecting an appropriate network topology from the wide variety of options remains difficult due to the complexity of analyzing traffic alongside topology performance characteristics. Traditional research focused on congestion estimation and specific parameter adjustment without reconfiguring the global topology. In this paper, we propose a generic Traffic to Hierarchical Topology (T2HT) method to analyze traffic patterns and choose an appropriate network configuration for the given traffic T2HT makes use of actual traffic data with a hierarchical model to predict network performance with a given topology and uses a machine learning (ML) algorithm to score the better options in order to determine the best topology. We performed 8000 simulations of dataset-Topology combinations to verify the feasibility of the model. Our results show that T2HT achieved marked improvements with its recommendations, making it feasible for use in hierarchical network design.

However, when dealing with short answers, replicating the decisions of a human grader is still a challenge, as the portability of essay evaluation techniques to short answers has not produced results with the same level of accuracy. In this sense, the present paper aims to foster the development of studies in the field of automated evaluation of short discursive answers. The related works presented three main approaches: text-to-text similarity, knowledge-based similarity that rely on synonym dictionary and corpus-based similarity that rely on a related corpus. The present study has employed an n-gram based similarity and a categorization process applied to three sets of answers to questions in Portuguese language: two of them (Biology and Geography) obtained from an admission process to higher education and the third (Philosophy) from a virtual learning environment. The employed method was comprised of a five-stage pipeline architecture: corpus selection, preprocessing, variable generation, classification and accuracy validation. In these three corpora, several similarity measurements and distances resulting from the unigrams/bigrams combination were explored. During the classification stage, two methods were used: multiple linear regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). At the same time some research questions were revised leading to meaningful findings.

While unlinking is a kind of incomplete deletion, 'deleted data' remains on cloud and can be recovered. To make 'deleted data' unrecoverable, overwriting is an effective method on cloud. Users lose control over their data on cloud once deleted, so it is difficult for them to confirm overwriting. In face of such a crucial problem, we propose a Provable and Traceable Assured Deletion (PTAD) scheme in cloud storage based on blockchain. PTAD scheme relies on overwriting to achieve assured deletion. We reference the idea of data integrity checking and design algorithms to verify if cloud overwrites original blocks properly as specific patterns. We utilize technique of smart contract in blockchain to automatically execute verification and keep transaction in ledger for tracking. The whole scheme can be divided into three stages-unlinking, overwriting and verification-and we design one specific algorithm for each stage.

576,595,595,Active and adaptive application-level flow control for latency sensitive RPC applications,"The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) frameworks are widely deployed in industry. Applications supported by RPC frameworks are often latency-sensitive which strictly require to be responded before the deadline. For meeting this requirement, RPC frameworks adopt the application-level flow control mechanism. This mechanism gives an appropriate threshold determining the number of RPC requests that the server can process, thus avoids missing the deadline. However, this threshold at the application-level is a fixed empirical value so that it is hard to obtain respectable performance because an endpoint's processing capacity can take a huge quantity of values by varying workload and different hardware configurations. While other methods based on specialized transport protocols are adaptive, they will introduce extra costs for message reporting from server to client. Furthermore, adopting specialized transport protocols will also introduce extra transplanting efforts for TCP-based applications. In this paper, we provide an active and adaptive application level flow control mechanism at the client side. We first design an algorithm to find the appropriate threshold to achieve the desired response time. Then based on this algorithm, we control the threshold to bound the response time as expected. We implement our flow control mechanism using a memcached testbed. Experiments prove that our mechanism can accurately reduce the mean and 99th percentile response time by at least 71.3% and 69.4% respectively, while keeping a relatively high QPS.

First, using bitmap index, the rich data are filtered out from the unfiltered raw dataset to be analyzed effectively. Thus, the eligible candidate data are identified through this process. Second, the frequent patterns are identified using cluster based bit vector appropriate for effective decision making. Hence, scanning of raw data is completely avoided using bitmap index. Also, it eliminates the storage of the candidate's unnecessary data while forming a cluster table. Consequently, it implies improvements in optimizing the database storage for maximum performance and efficiency using FBICBV algorithm compared existing algorithms.",60094044,R.M.D. Engineering College,Kavaraipettai,India,"['1706', '1703']",17.375,0.2259615384615385,0.5147435897435898,1,0.13291139240506328,0.06329113924050633,0.379746835443038
581,600,600,Epileptic seizure detection based on bandwidth features of EEG signals,"Detection of seizure from EEG signals may help neurologist analyze the condition of epileptic patients. Variance in types of epileptic seizures provides challenge in recognizing the pattern of seizure signals from normal ones. In this paper, we discuss the classification of seizure and non-seizure conditions in epilepsy based on bandwidth features of EEG signals. These features were extracted using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). This method decomposes signal into eight Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and its residue. The IMFs is then analyzed by Hilbert transform to obtain amplitude modulation bandwidth (BAM) and frequency modulation bandwidth (BFM). These features are fed as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM). We propose to combine the first four IMFs to extract bandwidth features and we implement this method on two data sets, public data set that contains signals from both extracranial and intracranial EEG, and data set OF Rumah Sakit Universitas Airlangga (RSUA) that contains signals from extracranial EEG only. The results showed that in general, the values of accuracy and specificity using combined features of first four IMFs outperformed those using features of single IMF, for all SVM kernel functions. The best accuracy and specificity on public data set were 97.3% and 98.25% respectively using RBF kernel, while the best sensitivity was gained using polynomial kernel based on only IMF1 bandwidth features by 99.0%. The experiments on RSUA data showed that the best accuracy was 96.5% and the best specificity was 99.38% when using Mexican Hat kernel based on combined features of first four IMFs, while the best sensitivity was 94% when using polynomial kernel based on only IMF1 bandwidth features.",60070707,Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember,Surabaya,Indonesia,['1700'],24.272727272727273,0.29642857142857143,0.3598809523809524,1,0.11147540983606558,0.10491803278688525,0.4389438943894389
582,601,601,Deepaoa: Online vehicular direction finding based on a deep learning method,"Relative direction estimation among neighboring vehicles in urban environment is essential to a wide variety of driving safety applications. To obtain accurate direction information solely from vehicle-To-vehicle (V2V) communications is desirable but very challenging due to the highly dynamic vehicular environments. In this paper, we propose an online vehicular AoA estimation scheme, called DeepAoA, based on a deep learning method. More specifically, Channel state information (CSI) is estimated from a set of synchronized receiving radios by a receiver vehicle. By taking the CSI phase difference between a pair of such radios, CSI phase errors in baseband can be effectively eliminated, which makes CSI phase difference a compelling feature to represent the direction of incident radio frequency (RF) signals and the dynamic channel characteristics. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then trained with labeled samples of CSI phase difference. We implement a prototype of DeepAoA receiver using four synchronized USRPs with their antennas in uniform circular array (UCA) configuration for full field of view. We collect real-world CSI trace and conduct trace-driven simulations. DeepAoA can achieve AoA estimation errors of less than 3 degrees with a 98% confidence interval with four antennas.

Matrix multiplication is under the list of time-consuming problems that require s huge computational resources to improve its speedup. As many studies have shown, it is not easy to achieve high performance speedup in sequential matrix multiplication algorithm using larger input. The emphasis of this study is to propose a parallel algorithm to calculate the product of two square matrices with improved speedup performance compared to the sequential and OpenMP algorithms. In this research, biruni (super machine workstation) in the School of Computer Sciences, USM, Malaysia with General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GP-GU) was used to parallelize the matrix product algorithm. A comparison between parallel OpenMp versions and sequential algorithm with the proposed CUDA based algorithm of this research was carried out to evaluate the speedup performance of the proposed parallel CUDA based algorithm. The overall results show that CUDA based parallel matrix multiplication is approximately 400 times faster than sequential matrix multiplication and 4 times faster than OpenMp matrix multiplication algorithms, respectively.

To maintain this critical network secure, it is important to develop the realtime network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The widely used NIDS was developed for the general Internet environment where the average throughput to protect attacks from the large number of unknown network nodes is more important than the real-time detection capability. However, in the critical industrial network, the real-time protection is more important than the average throughput. In this paper, a FPGA-based abnormal Ethernet packet detector is proposed. Since it is designed for the closed industry network, packet detection is based on the whitelist that consists of the allowed network address and protocol numbers. The prototype system has been implemented using the Xilinx Zynq-7030 SoC running at 250MHz. The network header of the Ethernet packet is compared to the 256 whitelist ruleset within 0.032Œºsec, which means that the malicious packets from the abnormal network nodes are filtered out even before the whole packets arrives.

In addition to the prediction accuracy, we evaluate different prediction methods through the performance of TE, as well as the prediction time. We test the proposed methods by real world datasets from Abilene, CERNET and G√âANT. The experiment results show that prediction methods based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) can achieve better prediction accuracy than methods leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN). Predicting each OD flow through RNN models can further improve the prediction accuracy, as well as the performance of TE under the OSPF network scenario, the SDN/OSPF hybrid network scenario and the multi-commodity flow problem scenario.

To address this problem, a software process activity classifier is proposed to build event-activity mapping relationships from software development event streams, revealing activity attributes and associating the activity to the original SVN log. The proposed approach extracts activity from the SVN log based on semantic features and introduces a novel technique based on a naive Bayes approach to associate event activities dynamically. The approach has been applied to two real-world software development process logs, ArgoUML and jEdit, consisting of more than 80,000 events, covering development information from 1998 to 2015. With the application of our approach to such data, activities can be extracted from event logs and a classifier can be constructed for adding activity attributes to new events. The results of the classification are evaluated in terms of precision rate, recall rate, and the F-measure. Overall, two real-world software development process logs are used to validate the method, and the experimental results show that the approach can mine software process activities from SVN log events automatically and in real-time.",60028009,Yunnan University,Kunming,China,['1700'],27.625,0.04702797202797203,0.4926573426573426,1,0.12941176470588237,0.03137254901960784,0.363265306122449
601,620,620,A time-based dynamic synchronization policy for consolidated database systems," All rights reserved.Data is becoming an increasingly important asset in today's organizations. Various challenges in the age of big data, such as high volume and high velocity, call for efficient database maintenance policies. This study focuses on deriving an optimal synchronization policy for consolidated database systems. By trading off synchronization cost with data staleness cost, we propose a time-based dynamic synchronization (TDS) policy, which evaluates the system state at predetermined checkpoints and synchronizes a consolidated database system only if given staleness thresholds are crossed. Although several database synchronization and knowledge refreshment policies have been proposed in the prior literature, the TDS policy retains their advantages and overcomes their inflexibility in that, under the TDS policy, system check and synchronization are easy to schedule, disruptions to business operations can be avoided, and synchronization is run only if necessary. Experimental results show that the TDS policy consistently outperforms benchmark policies, leading to substantial cost savings. In particular, the performance gap between the TDS policy and a static periodic policy is greater when data changes arrive less frequently but carry higher unit staleness costs, or when queries arrive more frequently and suffer higher unit staleness costs.",60123158,Mendoza College of Business,Notre Dame,United States,"['1710', '1706']",27.714285714285715,0.16613333333333336,0.5032000000000001,0,0.11818181818181818,0.022727272727272728,0.3209302325581395

This node may act as a border router to provide Internet connectivity to the members of the DODAG but such a situation creates a single point of failure. Upon border router failure, all nodes connected to the DODAG are affected as all ongoing communications are instantly broken and no new communications can be initiated. Moreover, nodes close to the border router should forward traffic from farther nodes in addition to their own, which may cause congestion and energy depletion inequality. In this article we specify a full solution to enable border router redundancy in RPL networks. To achieve this, we propose a mechanism leveraging cooperation between colocated RPL networks. It enables failover to maintain Internet connectivity and load balancing to improve the overall energy consumption and bandwidth.

In the evolving of data redundancy schemes, storage-reliability-repair trade-offs always exist. From replication to erasure codes, higher reliability achieves with lower storage cost, but the higher repair penalty can not be ignored. Optimized data redundancy schemes like regenerating codes or basic pyramid codes are proposed to relieve the high repair penalty. In order to study the storage-reliability-repair trade-offs, we propose a new model based on the standard Markov Chain, it takes the irregular fault tolerance, latent sector error and correlated failures into account, and measures the storage and repair cost from system perspective. Through inter-scheme and intra-scheme discussions, we find some principles about choosing data redundancy schemes and corresponding parameters to achieve better storage-reliability-repair trade-offs.

Significant results in this area have resulted in many highly promising solutions; however most of the existing solutions follow the conventional sender-centric design and the strict layering principle, without considering the fact that the receiver's intelligence and cross-layer activities can result in distinct performance advantages. In this paper, we propose MPTCP-RC, a receiver-centric cross-layer solution to aid MPTCP towards efficient parallel multipath data transmission in a wireless environment. In MPTCP-RC, the receiver performs path usage decision and cross-layer activity, by making use of its acquired first-hand knowledge of both transport layer and MAC layer, rather than only giving feedback to the sender then waiting for the decision.

Its NP-hard nature makes this problem attractive to be studied, especially in the field of operation research and artificial intelligence. In the literature, the state-of-the-art approach for solving examination timetabling problem is meta-heuristics. However, this approach has limitation, i.e. the need for intensive problem-specific parameter tuning. To cope with this problem, a relatively new approach namely hyper-heuristics was proposed. Different from meta-heuristics that search upon solution space, hyper-heuristics search upon low-level space. This strategy makes hyper-heuristics more generic that works over cross-domain, compared to meta-heuristics that usually designed for specific problem domain.

Each sensor stores its harvested energy losslessly in an infinite capacity battery. In each time slot, K sensors are selected for data transmission over K mutual orthogonal channels. FC knows neither battery states of sensors, nor statistics of EH processes at sensors. FC just knows outcomes of previous transmission attempts. A sensor transmits data if it is scheduled and has enough energy in its battery. FC aims to maximize fairness among EH sensor nodes over the time horizon under the proportionate progress (P-fairness) by using Jain's Fairness Index. Uniforming Random Ordered Policy (UROP) and Myopic Policy (MP) are suggested as solutions to the fairness problem. It is shown both analytically and numerically that under infinite capacity battery assumption, UROP achieves asymptotically optimal performance in fairness under quite general EH process over infinite time horizon.

610,629,629,A weighting localization algorithm with LOS and one-bound NLOS identification in multipath environments," All rights reserved.Mobile station (MS) localization often suffers from hybrid line of sight (LOS), one-bound (OB) and multiple-bound (MB) non-line of sight (NLOS) propagation in multipath environments. Due to the unknown propagation path, accurate position estimate of MS is challenging through using the measured angle of departure (AOD), angle of arrival (AOA), and time of arrival (TOA) of signal between MS and base station (BS). To address this problem, a new weighting localization algorithm based on LOS and OB NLOS identification is proposed in this paper. For each propagation path, by utilizing the geometric relation between AOD and AOA, a theoretic threshold is derived to decide whether it is LOS or NLOS propagation. Moreover, in order to further discriminate OB or MB NLOS propagation, an effective cost function is formulated and an iterative OB NLOS identification method is proposed to discard MB NLOS propagation paths. Finally, a weighting localization algorithm is applied for fusing the measured data of LOS and OB NLOS propagation paths. Simulation results demonstrate that simulation of LOS identification method is consistent with theoretic one, and the proposed algorithm can greatly improve the localization accuracy of MS in different multipath environments, especially when LOS path is available.",60003030,Chongqing Jiaotong University,Chongqing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1708', '1703']",28.714285714285715,0.09742424242424244,0.6708585858585858,0,0.09349593495934959,0.11382113821138211,0.4008438818565401

It holds further promise in solving more challenging problems if we can overcome obstacles, such as the lack of quality training data and poor interpretability. The exploitation of domain knowledge and application semantics can enhance existing deep learning methods by infusing relevant conceptual information into a statistical, data-driven computational approach. This will require resolving the impedance mismatch due to different representational forms and abstractions between symbolic and statistical AI techniques. In this article, we describe a continuum that comprises of three stages for infusion of knowledge into the machine/deep learning architectures. As this continuum progresses across these three stages, it starts with shallow infusion in the form of embeddings, and attention and knowledge-based constraints improve with a semideep infusion. Toward the end reflecting deeper incorporation of knowledge, we articulate the value of incorporating knowledge at different levels of abstractions in the latent layers of neural networks.

620,639,639,Centralized QoS Routing Using Network Calculus for SDN-Based Streaming Media Networks,"Streaming media transmission requires strict quality of service (QoS) parameters such as maximum delay and delay jitter. An effective streaming media routing algorithm is a key factor in ensuring QoS. The existing solution only considers a single parameter indicator in the performance parameters such as bandwidth, delay, and utilization of the link, and fails to comprehensively measure the data flow in the network. It is not possible to comprehensively measure the relationship between the business attributes and the QoS parameters. Firstly, the deterministic upper bounds of QoS parameters in streaming media networks are solved by using network calculus theory, and the QoS parameters are normalized, and a multi-constrained QoS resource allocation model is established; the separation of control and forwarding planes is defined by using software-defined networking (SDN) to deploy the multi-constrained QoS resource allocation model in the control plane; the QoS routing system of streaming media network based on the SDN is designed and implemented, including flow table scheduling model, routing function, measurement and forwarding modules. In the routing function module of the SDN controller, a multi-constrained QoS routing algorithm based on network calculus is implemented.

621,640,640,Study on Pricing Method of Power Quality Differentiated Market Service in Distribution Grid,"With the development of society and economy and the application of the high-tech equipment, the structure of power load in modern power system has greatly changed. In the power market environment, the relationship between power quality and customer demand has caught more and more attention among power suppliers and customers. In this circumstance, quality factors are inevitably taken into account when we price for power transactions. The prices of electricity market service also vary with the quality of such a service. This paper analyzes the power market environment and technical support required by the quality pricing of the power transaction in the power market environment on this basis, and proposes a power quality differentiated market service pricing method for the distribution grid, which involves power quality governance, loss and user response. The primary system diagram and RBTS-bus3 in the practical application of distribution grid are used for case analysis.

All rights reserved.Recently, thanks to its positive impact on surveillance in the context of the network Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Several reports have been published for decades, but there has not been much attention paid to research on diagnosis of network loss under sensitive conditions. This might also serve to increase WSN's average lifetime and network scalability. Due to the ad-hoc properties of sensor nodes, however, the network scalability is reduced and the network administrator is therefore poorly observing the network conditions. In this paper, we consider improving the lifetime and scalability of sensor nodes using backpropogation neural network (BPNN) with Reinforcement Learning (RIL) machine learning approach.

624,643,643,Fractional contrast stretching for image enhancement of aerial and satellite images," Frequently, illumination of the same region can be totally different. This is usually due to shadowing self-obstruction or light reflection. Existing image enhancement methods fail to improve hidden details and local contrast at the same visualization level. They are not developed to enhance through local dark or light regions simultaneously. Also, the current aerial and satellite image enhancement methods have several limitations. For instance, these include intensity saturation, non-uniform brightness, halo effect, blur edges, and so on. This article introduces a fractional contrast stretching concept for aerial and satellite image enhancement based on a novel automated non-uniform luminance normalization that is not provided by the user as input parameters. The introduced approach contains several new techniques: (i) no reference non-linearly fractional contrast stretching with automatic non-uniform luminance normalization and (ii) non-linearly local contrast stretching for spatial details and edge sharpening. The proposed algorithm was tested on the orthorectified aerial photograph database with a pixel resolution of 1 meter or finer from across the United States during 2000‚Äì2016.

625,644,644,A data-sharing aware and scalable cache miss rates model for multi-core processors with multi-level cache hierarchies,"To mitigate the ever worsening 'Power wall' and 'Memory wall' problems, multi-core architectures with multi-level cache hierarchies have been widely used in modern processors. However, data sharing caused by the concurrent threads running on different cores and the 'filter effects' of multi-level caches make the analytical cache modeling of such systems extremely complex. Prior models either ignore the data sharing or evaluate its effect with large simulation costs. In this paper, we propose a data-sharing aware and scalable analytical model for estimating the miss rates of the downstream shared cache in a multi-core environment. Our model uses probability derivations to quantify the data sharing effects based on the information of access address distributions for each core. Moreover, the proposed model can also be scalably integrated with upstream cache models without the time-consuming simulations of the cache architecture. We validate our analytical model against gem5 simulation results under 13 benchmarks from PARSEC benchmark suites. We compare the L2 cache miss rates with the results from gem5 under 8 hardware configurations including dual-core and quad-core architectures. The average absolute error is less than 2% for all configurations.",60005244,"Southeast University, Nanjing",Nanjing,China,['1708'],20.555555555555557,0.01341991341991342,0.3859307359307359,1,0.09954751131221719,0.027149321266968326,0.3811881188118812

Recently, it was observed that the social media could be leveraged for influencing healthier lifestyle. It is believed that, to motivate people to engage with social media or any wellness system, social support is important. However, research indicated that the understanding of social support from the perspectives of system design is still lacking. This study aims to fill these gaps and have better understanding of social support through the Persuasive System Design (PSD). The objectives of this research are (i) to identify the social support elements within the persuasive design elements (ii) to qualitatively verify the social support elements for Malaysian wellness in social media. Qualitative data collection was conducted through social media content observations and focus group interviews with selected respondents. Five PSD elements in social support were identified.

629,648,648,A Reinforcement One-Shot Active Learning Approach for Aircraft Type Recognition,"Target recognition is an important aspect of air traffic management, but the study on automatic aircraft identification is still in the exploratory stage. Rapid aircraft processing and accurate aircraft type recognition remain challenging tasks due to the high-speed movement of the aircraft against complex backgrounds. Active learning, as a promising research topic of machine learning in recent decades, can use less labeled data to obtain the same model accuracy as supervised learning, which greatly reduces the cost of labeling a dataset. Instead of manually developing policies of accessing the labels of desired instances, an improved active learning approach, which can not only learn to classify samples using small supervision but additionally capture a relatively optimal label query strategy, was developed by employing the reinforcement learning in the process of decision-making. The proposed model was first tested with the Amsterdam Library of Object Images (ALOI) dataset and then used to perform aircraft type recognition on one-month real-world flight track data.

630,649,649,Detection of Infrared Small Targets Using Feature Fusion Convolutional Network,"This paper proposes the feature extraction backbone network MNET that is specifically designed for the detection of infrared small targets. The overall network uses three down-sampling operations to adjust the size of the feature map, while preserving sufficient physical characteristics of the small infrared target to be used in the detection. In a next step, the dense connection is used to save the output of each layer of the network in the front channel of the feature map, to better integrate the location information of the shallow network and the semantic information of the deep network. In this way accurate network positioning and classification effects are achieved. As a last step, we introduce a feature attention mechanism to obtain the importance of each feature channel, and to enhance useful features according to their degree of importance. In this way we achieve an adaptive calibration of the feature channels. In order to train the proposed detection network MNET from scratch, the single-phase detection algorithm YOLO is adopted for the detection part. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we captured images and created an infrared small target dataset. The experimental results show that MNET can accurately detect targets of 2 √ó2 pixels size in infrared images of 640 √ó 512 pixels at a processing speed of up to 105 frames per second.

At the heart of our approach is the concept of motion style, in particular for facial expressions, i.e., the person-specific expression change that is yet another essential factor beyond visual accuracy in face editing applications. Our method is based on a recurrent generative adversarial network that captures the spatiotemporal co-activation of facial expressions, and enables generating and modifying the facial expressions of the target actor while preserving their style. We train our model with unsynchronized source and target videos in an unsupervised manner using cycle-consistency and mouth expression losses, and synthesize photorealistic video frames using a layered neural face renderer.

640,659,659,Energy Efficient Communication among Wearable Devices using Optimized Motion Detection,"When a person is performing daily activities (e.g. walking) in the context of a WBAN application, the channel quality between the worn sensor devices and the hub can vary due to the switching of Line-Of-Sight (LOS) and None-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) statuses among the sender and the receiver. Therefore, motion aware wireless MAC protocols are designed in order to enhance communication reliability and to avoid wasting energy on unnecessary wireless re-transmissions during most of the NLOS communications. Despite its importance, the prerequisite step of accurate and energy efficient motion detection remains as an assumption in most of the existing motion aware WBAN protocols. Hence in this paper, we propose an optimized real-time gesture detection method and implement it in a motion aware WBAN communication protocol.

641,660,660,Optimizing the aggregated throughput of gpus in public clouds based on adaptive kernel reordering,"GPGPUs have been widely used in public Clouds for the high computational ability, while a single GPU is shared by multiple tenants. When multiple applications share a single GPU, their kernels time-shares the GPU and the frequent context switches result in heavy overhead, and degrade the aggregated throughput of the GPU in consequence. To improve the aggregated throughput of GPUs, we design a system that eliminates unnecessary context switches throughput adaptive kernel reordering. It is challenging to achieve the above purpose because emerging real-system GPUs encapsulate the kernel scheduling policy in the device driver and there is no open interface to schedule/reorder the kernels. To resolve the above challenge, the designed system reorders kernels of different applications before they are transmitted to GPU.

642,661,661,Vcec: Velocity control of energy-constrained rf-based wireless charger in sensor networks with multi-depots deployment,"RF energy transfer, as the main far-field wireless energy transfer technology in wireless sensor networks, allows the relatively long charging distance from wireless charger to sensor nodes. Existing charging schemes based on a mobile RF energy charger neglect the energy consumption of the charger and its limited battery capacity. Motivated by this, we consider the practical charging scenario where energy-constrained mobile charger (MC) travels along a constrained long trajectory in the network area to wirelessly power the sensors, with multiple depots (for the energy provision of MC) deployed on the trajectory to achieve high energy efficiency. In this paper, we introduce VCEC, a Velocity-Control scheme of Energy-constrained mobile Charger to maximize the minimum charged energy in nodes after MC passes through the whole trajectory. Specifically, we first simplify the initial velocity-control problem to a tractable one by discretizing the trajectory into segments and propose a distributed algorithm to solve it. Then, we present a segment merging algorithm for the real-world applications. Our VCEC scheme achieves an approximation ratio of (1-Œò)(1+ œµ)1. Simulations and test-bed experiments are conducted to show that VCEC promotes the bottleneck node's charged energy by at least 20% as compared to the baseline scheme where MC moves at a constant speed.",60026282,Zhejiang University of Technology,Hangzhou,China,['1708'],25.5,0.025436507936507938,0.2735714285714286,1,0.128099173553719,0.049586776859504134,0.33620689655172414

646,665,665,Sensitivity Analysis about Transient Three-Dimensional IHCP with Multi-Parameters in an Elbow Pipe with Thermal Stratification,"Pipelines with thermal stratification are common in nuclear power plants, and the thermal stratification may induce thermal fatigue and lead to leakage, so thermal stratification analysis of the pipeline is particularly significant. Due to the requirement of structural integrity, for the piping system of nuclear power plants, it is not allowed to trepan for installing sensors to measure the internal parameters. The inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP) based on the easily available temperature information of the outer wall can precisely estimate the boundary conditions of the inner wall. However, the precision of inverse estimation is influenced by the measuring precision, the number and the arrangement of measuring points. This work aims at the sensitive analysis about the measuring errors and the number and locations of measuring points. The research is based on an elbow pipe with thermal stratification-a pipe type commonly used in industry. Because it is easy to disturb the flow field to install sensors inside the pipeline, and it is difficult to calculate the convective heat transfer coefficient, the numerical experiments are taken in this study.

Our framework contains three main components: the strands modeled as discrete rods, the bulk liquid represented as a continuum (material point method), and a reduced-dimensional flow of liquid on the surface of the strands with detailed elastoviscoplastic behavior. These three components are tightly coupled together. To enable discrete strands interacting with continuum-based liquid, we develop models that account for the volume change of the liquid as it passes through strands and the momentum exchange between the strands and the liquid. We also develop an extended constraint-based collision handling method that supports cohesion between strands. Furthermore, we present a principled method to preserve the total momentum of a strand and its surface flow, as well as an analytic plastic flow approach for Herschel-Bulkley fluid that enables stable semi-implicit integration at larger time steps.

649,668,668,Learning an intrinsic garment space for interactive authoring of garment animation," All rights reserved.Authoring dynamic garment shapes for character animation on body motion is one of the fundamental steps in the CG industry. Established workflows are either time and labor consuming (i.e., manual editing on dense frames with controllers), or lack keyframe-level control (i.e., physically-based simulation). Not surprisingly, garment authoring remains a bottleneck in many production pipelines. Instead, we present a deep-learning-based approach for semi-automatic authoring of garment animation, wherein the user provides the desired garment shape in a selection of keyframes, while our system infers a latent representation for its motion-independent intrinsic parameters (e.g., gravity, cloth materials, etc.). Given new character motions, the latent representation allows to automatically generate a plausible garment animation at interactive rates. Having factored out character motion, the learned intrinsic garment space enables smooth transition between keyframes on a new motion sequence. Technically, we learn an intrinsic garment space with an motion-driven autoencoder network, where the encoder maps the garment shapes to the intrinsic space under the condition of body motions, while the decoder acts as a differentiable simulator to generate garment shapes according to changes in character body motion and intrinsic parameters. We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on common garment types. Experiments demonstrate our system can significantly improve current garment authoring workflows via an interactive user interface. Compared with the standard CG pipeline, our system significantly reduces the ratio of required keyframes from 20% to 1 - 2%.",60022148,UCL,London,United Kingdom,['1704'],23.6,0.1266233766233766,0.4161255411255412,0,0.10452961672473868,0.006968641114982578,0.3643122676579926

Considering the fullness of current Cloud construction, complicated combination of hospital staff, differences of prioritization between hospital staff and patients, and varied levels of privacy regulation of people in groups or individuals, the difficulty of security exchange and information sharing will increase. Therefore, there is necessity of existence for one flexible and efficient group-oriented cryptosystem. We proposed a bilinear pairing-based group-oriented cryptosystem to overcame above situations. This proposal owns the following advantages: (I) The cryptosystem can simultaneously realize four decryption strategies, enabling receivers to designate appropriate decryptors according to the content of plaintext. (II) All group members need only one private key, which can be used for decryption regardless of the decryption modes. Therefore, errors resulting from the misuse of keys can be avoided, and the difficulty of key management can be reduced. (III) The system is required to disclose only six parameters, thus decreasing spatial complexity. (IV) Regardless of the encryption and decryption modes, receivers must perform encryption only one time, and the length of the ciphertext comprises only four parameters. Thus, the proposed cryptosystem computing (including environment setting and the processes of encryption and decryption) is highly efficient, with easy key management, low spatial complexity, and small amount of ciphertext being transmitted.",60078643,National Penghu University,Makung,Taiwan,['1700'],21.272727272727273,-0.0002898550724637664,0.6260144927536232,1,0.13028169014084506,0.014084507042253521,0.40217391304347827

The standard WiFi association method makes the STAs select the AP with the strongest signal, which in many cases leads to underutilization of some APs while overcrowding others. To mitigate this situation, Reinforcement Learning techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandits can be used to dynamically learn the optimal mapping between APs and STAs, and so redistribute the STAs among the available APs accordingly. This is an especially challenging problem since the network response observed by a given STA depends on the behavior of the others, and so it is very difficult to predict without a global view of the network. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem in a decentralized way, where STAs independently explore the different APs inside their coverage range, and select the one that better satisfy its needs. To do it, we propose a novel approach called opportunistic \varepsilon-greedy with Stickiness that halts the exploration when a suitable AP is found, then, the STA remains associated to that same AP while it is satisfied, only resuming the exploration after several unsatisfactory association periods. With this approach, we reduce significantly the network response variability, improving the ability of the STAs to find a solution faster, as well as achieving a more efficient use of the network resources.",60032942,Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona,Barcelona,Spain,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",33.285714285714285,0.19342105263157894,0.4986842105263158,1,0.12547528517110265,0.049429657794676805,0.3204633204633205

Furthermore, when two nodes encounter, the forward decision depends on the distance between each node to the destination node, if the delivery predictabilities of encountered nodes are similar.

As the key system to generate a high enough voltage (20 kV) required for gas breakdown and plasma initiation, the Switch Network Unit (SNU) should have the ability to transfer 80 kA direct current by inserting resistor (0.25~ Œ©) to the superconducting coil circuit in 12 milliseconds.

In this paper, we formalize a Cost-optimized Multi-Controller Deployment (CO-MCD) problem by concerning the controller's deployment cost and the network service's delay cost. Meanwhile, we characterize the communication between the controller and the switch using a queuing system, and design an algorithm to determine the optimal deployment in the specified environment. Simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm can always obtain a deployment solution which minimizes the economic cost of the entire SDN network.

In this paper, we propose a traffic-differentiated secure opportunistic routing from a game theoretic perspective, DSOR. In the proposed scheme, we use a novel method to calculate trust value, considering node's forwarding capability and the status of different types of flows. According to the resource status of the network, we propose a service price and resource price for the auction model, which is used to select optimal candidate forwarding sets.

Recent researches have made several progresses in this field, however most of them can only recognize default activities which is probably not needed by smart home services. In addition, low scalability makes such researches infeasible out of laboratory. In this work, we unwrap this issue and propose a novel framework to not only recognize human activity, but also predict it. The framework contains three stages: recognition after the activity; recognition in progress and activity prediction in advance. With the help of RFID tags, the hardware cost of our framework is low enough to popularize.

Then, more reliable the energy should become, especially the distribution network, to keep the entire process running. In this level of energy distribution, where residential consumers and medium and small industries are supplied, the number of interconnections of the network is enormous. However, for economic and environmental aspects, these complex systems, which are operating close to their capacity, needs to increase the automation, appearing the concept of smart grids and the Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) and its methods to control. Inside of the ADMS, there are a lot of essential techniques. Among them, there are two techniques which are the most relevant for this paper: the self-healing and load management. In an ADMS system, these two techniques are treated separately, but the best solution occurs when they are computed together. In this paper, it is proposed an approach that can address both problems at the same time or individually, i.e., in place to have a sequential method to solve step-by-step the issues in the networks.

In this paper, we address the problem of SFC orchestration in the multiple data centers aiming at minimizing deploying cost with delay constraint. Especially, we take into account the impact of VNFs on the link cost and multiple ingresses/egresses of SFCs. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and propose a heuristic algorithm called Cost-Aware and Delay-Constrained SFC Orchestration (CADCSO) to the problem. Extensive simulation results show that CADCSO can achieve near-optimal results with much less time in small-scale network environments.

However, state-of-the-art ABR (Adaptive Bitrate) algorithms do not take into account the presence of a cache on video delivery path. In this paper, we firstly investigate how these ABR algorithms behave in the context of edge caching system and how caching factors such as hit ratio and access bandwidth impact on the performance of ABR algorithms. Extensive analysis results show introducing an edge cache on video delivery path cannot necessarily improve the performance of ABR algorithms in terms of average QoE. Furthermore, we propose a cache-aware ABR approach taking into account caching information including a cache hit indicator for the past chunks and the availability of the next video chunk on the cache. Experimental results validate the significant benefits of the approach which helps to make a more accurate throughput estimation and is more likely to select the video chunks stored in the cache to increase cache utilization.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",29.83333333333333,0.18166666666666667,0.515,1,0.11386138613861387,0.06930693069306931,0.31794871794871793

671,691,691,Information-Agnostic Traffic Scheduling in Data Center Networks with Asymmetric Topologies,"As more and more applications are deployed in data centers, they rely on high performance data center networks (DCNs) to meet users' increasing quality of the experience (QoE) requirements. Hence, minimizing the average flow completion time (FCT) has been one of the most important goals for DCNs. However, existing traffic scheduling methods assume either prior knowledge of flows (i.e., sizes and deadlines) or symmetric topologies (i.e., Fat-Tree or Bcube). In practice, it is difficult to obtain the information of flows. Moreover, even with symmetric topology design, the DCNs will become asymmetric due to the inevitable link failure and congestion. In this case, it is a great challenge to minimize the average FCT in DCNs. In this paper, we propose a flowlet based information-agnostic traffic scheduling mechanism. The key idea of our method is leveraging multiple priority queues in switches to demote the priority of flows dynamically on the flowlet level. More specifically, the priority of a flow will be demoted according to the number of flowlets it has sent, which follows the shortest job first discipline. We formulate the average FCT minimization problem as a nonlinear Sum-of-Ratios problem and design two heuristic methods to derive the sub-optimal demotion thresholds. Experiment results show that our method can reduce the average FCT by up to 15.35% with a realistic workload, as compared to the state-of-the-art traffic scheduling methods.",60019533,Tianjin University,Tianjin,China,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",20.545454545454547,0.10166666666666667,0.4919841269841271,1,0.10071942446043165,0.03237410071942446,0.37404580152671757

674,694,694,Maximizing profits of allocating limited resources under stochastic user demands,"Nowadays, cloud brokers play an important role for allocating resources in the cloud computing market, which mediate between cloud users and service providers by buying a limited capacity from the providers and subleasing them to the users to make profits. However, the user demands are usually stochastic and the resource capacity bought from cloud providers is limited. Therefore, in order to maximize the profits, the broker needs an effective resource allocation algorithm to decide whether satisfying the demands of arriving users or not, i.e. need to allocate the resource to a valuable user. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation algorithm named Q-DP, which is based on reinforcement learning and dynamic programming, for the broker to maximize the profits. First, we consider all arriving users' demands at each stage as a bundle, and model the process of the broker allocating resources to all arriving users as a Markov Decision Process. We then use the Q-learning algorithm to determine how much resources will be allocated to the bundle of users arriving at the current stage. Next, we use dynamic programming to decide which cloud user will obtain the resources. Finally, we run experiments in the artificial dataset and realistic dataset respectively to evaluate our resource allocation algorithm against other typical resource allocation algorithms, and show that our algorithm can beat other algorithms, especially in the setting of the broker having extremely limited resources.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,['1708'],25.88888888888889,0.03027210884353742,0.4489795918367345,1,0.15708812260536398,0.019157088122605363,0.3062015503875969

In this paper, we first propose a formal method for translating OWL-S composite services into communicating automata using an iterative process which is driven by the control structure of that language.

An identification procedure based on short-time discrete Fourier transform and Welch power spectrum estimation was applied to detect 114 PLHR events and 328 MLR events that occurred as DEMETER satellite flew over China from 2008 to 2010. PLHR events feature parallel horizontal lines with a frequency interval of 50/100 Hz in spectrogram, whereas MLR events feature multi-parallel spectral lines with frequency drift as a baseline for possible triggered emissions as well as triggered emissions with no baseline. We statistically compared the temporal and geographical distribution, Kp and Dst indices, and propagation characteristics between PLHR and MLR events. PLHR events showed more obvious variations annually than MLR events, and the former had a close relationship with the development of Chinese power system. Both PLHR and MLR presented similar diurnal and seasonal differences, owing likely to the ionospheric state; moreover, they appeared to have no significant connection with geomagnetic activity level. The geographical distributions of PLHR and MLR differed significantly. PLHR events occurred in the range of (20¬∞ N-45¬∞ N), whereas MLR events were concentrated in southwestern low-latitude regions of (18¬∞ N-28¬∞N).

681,701,701,Optimizing the waiting time of sensors in a MANET to strike a balance between energy consumption and data timeliness,"Oceans are important for scientific research and also for global economic and military security. Usually, wireless ad hoc networks are chosen to transform real-Time data collected by ocean monitoring sensors (nodes). Due to the random motion of waves or the random direction of the wind, nodes in the network might become detached from the coverage of the network. In this case, the detached nodes can either send the collected data directly to the base station at the cost of consuming more energy or wait for a period of time to rejoin the network with the price of sacrificing the real time of the collected data. In this paper, we model the optimal waiting time for detached nodes before directly sending the data in the dynamic environment of ocean monitoring. For this purpose, we need to address two problems. The first is how to calculate the rate of coverage with a different number and different broadcast radii of nodes. The second is when a node detaches from the coverage of the network, how much time will it need to wait before it rejoins the network. We first establish the motion model of nodes, which is the basis to deduce the probability distribution of a certain time when the detached node rejoins the network. Based on the probability distribution, the waiting time of the detached nodes can be optimally determined, aiming to achieve a good balance between energy consumption and data timeliness.

This is repeated to find the minimum representation of the most frequent supplemental edges to be compatible with the sub-border margin. Sub-linear and sub-graph often use the mining process candidate generation model to find the biometric data set used to reduce the process.

Since a typical real-world product, service, or agreement cannot be reversed; associated transactions in the blockchain ledger must also be final. This paper describes and analyzes the transaction finality solution for our proof of work (PoW) mining based blockchain network, the Kona Blockchain Platform. The solution works even if 49% of the network's total mining power is compromised due to malicious attacks. Although designed for our specific platform, the ideas from the solution can be easily adapted to achieve transaction finality in existing public blockchain networks. This paper also discusses how this can be done.

The traditional co-location mining algorithms treated the spatial proximity relationship between the instances as unanimous by binary logic, which weakened the accuracy and effectiveness of the results. In this paper, the co-location pattern mining based on fuzzy neighbor relationship is studied. Firstly, fuzzy neighbor relationship (FNR) is defined to measure the proximity level between instances, and then the fuzzy participation ratio and the fuzzy participation index are defined. Secondly, the algorithm for spatial co-location pattern mining based on FNR (CPFNR) is proposed by the basic idea of the Join-less algorithm.

687,707,707,A Node rating based sharding scheme for blockchain,"The incumbent sharding schemes usually assign the nodes to different committees randomly to meet the demands of security and efficiency at the same time. For example, Elastico protocol obtains a random value by letting the node perform proof of work, and then uses this value for sharding. However, the strategy of random sharding ignores the objective differences between nodes, causing performance gaps between different committees in blockchain. This creates a bottleneck in the transaction throughput of the blockchain. In the paper, we propose a node rating based sharding scheme for blockchain system called NRSS. The key idea of NRSS is to evaluate nodes in the network by both the speeds and results of transactions verification before, and then assign them into different committees by balancing the score to reduce the performance gap between committees and increase the speed of transaction process. We implement NRSS in a local blockchain system, and the experiment results show that NRSS can increase the sharding effect of a blockchain, with an average throughput increase of 32.2% in the simulation environment where the node performance difference is up to 75%, depending on the number of nodes in the committee that are preset in the blockchain.",60019533,Tianjin University,Tianjin,China,['1708'],28.42857142857143,-0.15833333333333333,0.4312500000000001,1,0.10599078341013825,0.03686635944700461,0.2857142857142857

In the future, there will be an enormous number of IoT devices that generate an extensive amount of data to the mobile network. It has been estimated that approximately 28 billion connected IoT devices will exist by 2021. The number of IoT devices and the amount of data sent by the devices requires careful planning of the network infrastructure. This is why scalability analysis of the data transfer is very important. IoT devices are conventionally connected to the Internet via information brokers or gateway nodes. However, a single information broker may not be able to support the data transfer of a massive IoT node population.

689,709,709,Staged metaprogramming for shader system development,"The shader system for a modern game engine comprises much more than just compilation of source code to executable kernels. Shaders must also be exposed to art tools, interfaced with engine code, and specialized for performance. Engines typically address each of these tasks in an ad hoc fashion, without a unifying abstraction. The alternative of developing a more powerful compiler framework is prohibitive for most engines. In this paper, we identify staged metaprogramming as a unifying abstraction and implementation strategy to develop a powerful shader system with modest effort. By using a multi-stage language to perform metaprogramming at compile time, engine-specific code can consume, analyze, transform, and generate shader code that will execute at runtime. Staged metaprogramming reduces the effort required to implement a shader system that provides earlier error detection, avoids repeat declarations of shader parameters, and explores opportunities to improve performance. To demonstrate the value of this approach, we design and implement a shader system, called Selos, built using staged metaprogramming. In our system, shader and application code are written in the same language and can share types and functions. We implement a design space exploration framework for Selos that investigates static versus dynamic composition of shader features, exploring the impact of shader specialization in a deferred renderer. Staged metaprogramming allows Selos to provide compelling features with a simple implementation.",60076695,NVIDIA,Santa Clara,United States,['1704'],20.181818181818183,0.17555555555555555,0.549920634920635,1,0.17063492063492064,0.015873015873015872,0.29838709677419356

However, security issues have not been fully addressed in LPWAN specifications, especially, key distribution and key management. Physical layer key generation, which exploits wireless channel reciprocity and randomness to generate secure keys, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, we exploit the physical layer key generation problem in LPWAN communication and present a distributed and lightweight key generation scheme for Long Range (LoRa) based network. It explores the shared randomness extracted from measured RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) as consensus information to generate secure keys. To negotiate the RSSI signal as a bidirectional consistent key sequence, we propose a novel level-crossing quantization algorithm with an improved Cascade key agreement protocol to improve the key generation rate, as well as to avoid information leakage during transmission. We implement the proposed physical layer key generation scheme in a LoRa network prototype. Then we conduct extensive experiments in stationary and mobile indoor environments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed key generation scheme. Experimental results show that its achievable key rate can reach 29.5% in stationary scenario and 35.5% in mobile scenario. Its key generation rate can exceed 1 bit/s with a lightweight implementation on the LoRa network prototype.

Further, the provided optimum is not optimal in an online non-reconfigurable VN embedding setting because of the highly dynamic nature of user demands. Nowadays, due to lower hardware costs, distributed parallel computing can be used to deal with complex computing tasks with high efficiency.

However, existing FD MACs fail to fully take advantage of bidirectional transmissions because of neglecting a feature of FD wireless that whether to build bidirectional transmissions relies on the queuing state of peers. In this paper, we design PQ-MAC, the first FD MAC which exploits more bidirectional transmission opportunities by leveraging peers' queuing information. Since PQ-MAC seizes the neglected but important feature, PQ-MAC can improve the performance with a slight transmission overhead. Simulations show that, in a 1-cell FD WLAN, PQ-MAC can achieve higher throughput than existing MACs when the buffer of AP is relatively small (‚â§200 frames).

698,718,718,The camera offset space: Real-time potentially visible set computations for streaming rendering,"Potential visibility has historically always been of importance when rendering performance was insufficient. With the rise of virtual reality, rendering power may once again be insufficient, e.g., for integrated graphics of headmounted displays. To tackle the issue of efficient potential visibility computations on modern graphics hardware, we introduce the camera offset space (COS). Opposite to how traditional visibility computations work-where one determines which pixels are covered by an object under all potential viewpoints-the COS describes under which camera movement a sample location is covered by a triangle. In this way, the COS opens up a new set of possibilities for visibility computations. By evaluating the pairwise relations of triangles in the COS, we show how to efficiently determine occluded triangles. Constructing the COS for all pixels of a rendered view leads to a complete potentially visible set (PVS) for complex scenes. By fusing triangles to larger occluders, including locations between pixel centers, and considering camera rotations, we describe an exact PVS algorithm that includes all viewing directions inside a view cell. Implementing the COS is a combination of real-time rendering and compute steps. We provide the first GPU PVS implementation that works without preprocessing, on-the-fly, on unconnected triangles.

However, to robustly address realistic upscaling scenarios where the relation between high resolution and low resolution images is unknown, blind image super-resolution is required. To this end, we propose a solution that relies on three components: First, we use a degradation aware SR network to synthesize the HR image given a low resolution image and the corresponding blur kernel. Second, we train a kernel discriminator to analyze the generated high resolution image in order to predict errors present due to providing an incorrect blur kernel to the generator. Finally, we present an optimization procedure that is able to recover both the degradation kernel and the high resolution image by minimizing the error predicted by our kernel discriminator.

A major open problem is to devise a constructive version of Banaszczyk‚Äôs vector balancing theorem, i. e., to find an efficient algorithm which constructs the signed combination. We make progress towards this goal along several fronts. As our first contribution, we show an equivalence between Banaszczyk‚Äôs theorem and the existence of O(1)-subgaussian distributions over signed combinations. For the case of symmetric convex bodies, our equivalence implies the existence of a universal signing algorithm (i. e., independent of the body), which simply samples from the subgaussian sign distribution and checks to see if the associated combination lands inside the body. For asymmetric convex bodies, we provide a novel recentering procedure, which allows us to reduce to the case where the body is symmetric. As our second main contribution, we show that the above framework can be efficiently implemented when the vectors have length O(1/‚àölogn), recovering Banaszczyk‚Äôs results under this stronger assumption. More precisely, we use random walk techniques to produce the required O(1)-subgaussian signing distributions when the vectors have length O(1/‚àölogn), and use a stochastic gradient ascent method to implement the recentering procedure for asymmetric bodies.",60121653,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,San Diego,United States,['1703'],23.1,0.09890350877192984,0.41309523809523796,1,0.11538461538461539,0.07692307692307693,0.3490909090909091

705,725,725,Improving Resiliency of Software-Defined Networks with Network Coding-based Multipath Routing,"Traditional network routing protocol exhibits high statics and singleness, which provide significant advantages for the attacker. There are two kinds of attacks on the network: active attacks and passive attacks. Existing solutions for those attacks are based on replication or detection, which can deal with active attacks; but are helpless to passive attacks. In this paper, we adopt the theory of network coding to fragment the data in the Software-Defined Networks and propose a network coding-based resilient multipath routing scheme. First, we present a new metric named expected eavesdropping ratio to measure the resilience in the presence of passive attacks. Then, we formulate the network coding-based resilient multipath routing problem as an integer-programming optimization problem by using expected eavesdropping ratio. Since the problem is NP-hard, we design a Simulated Annealing-based algorithm to efficiently solve the problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms improve the defense performance against passive attacks by about 20% when compared with baseline algorithms.",60029445,University of Minnesota,Minneapolis,United States,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",19.875,0.04546969696969698,0.4952878787878789,1,0.16489361702127658,0.026595744680851064,0.32954545454545453

717,737,737,Magwi: Practical indoor localization with smartphone magnetic and wifi sensors,"Geomagnetic field and WiFi networks have attracted much attention in indoor localization, since they are pervasive, and their signals are easy to collect by off-The-shelf smartphones. However, there are still challenges in practice: 1) GFI (Geomagnetic Field intensity) read by magnetometer in smartphones is hard to be used directly, since it is in phone coordinate system and varies with phone attitude. On the other hand, the magnitude of GFI lacks location diversity; 2) WiFi RSS (Received Signal Strength) suffers from fluctuations due to multipath fading effect indoors. To address the above issues, we first propose Mag2D, a high quality feature of GFI. Mag2D is robust to phone attitude and has better spatial discrimination than the magnitude. We then study the complementary properties of Mag2D and RSS, and design MagWi, a practical fingerprinting indoor localization system fusing Mag2D and RSS. MagWi adjusts fusion weights of Mag2D and RSS according to their capabilities of discriminating locations. To do so, we propose LCD (Local Clustering Degree) to quantify the location-discriminating capability and build a LCD-Error model. The fusion weights are thus assigned dynamically based on the LCD-Error model during localization. We have implemented MagWi to provide location service on an Android phone in three typical indoor environments, covering a total area size over 600m2.

Reducing deviation of the predicted energy consumption from the actual one, softening peaks in demand and filling in the troughs, especially at times when power is more affordable and clean, present challenges for the demand-side response. In this paper, we present a hierarchical energy system architecture with embedded control. This architecture pushes prediction models to edge devices and executes local control loops to address the challenge of managing demand-side response locally. We employ a two-step approach: At an upper level of hierarchy, we adopt a conventional machine learning pipeline to build load prediction models using automated domain-specific feature extraction and selection. Given historical data, these models are then used to label prediction failure events that force the operator to use backup energy sources to stabilize the network. On a lower level of hierarchy, computed labels are used to train impact models realized by LSTM networks running on edge devices to infer the probability that the power consumption of the player contributes to the upper level prediction failure event. The system is evaluated on clustered and aggregated energy traces from a public data set of academic buildings. The results show the benefits of the proposed hierarchical energy system architecture in terms of impact prediction with 55% accuracy.

Their infinite resolution, controllable continuity and robust constructive solid geometry operations, coupled with smooth blending, enable powerful and intuitive sculpting tools for creating complex SDF models. SDF metric properties also admit efficient surface rendering with sphere tracing. Unfortunately, SDFs remain incompatible with many popular direct deformation techniques which re-position a surface via its explicit representation. Linear blend skinning used in character articulation, for example, directly displaces each vertex of a triangle mesh. To overcome this limitation, we propose a variant of sphere tracing for directly rendering deformed SDFs. We show that this problem reduces to integrating a non-linear ordinary differential equation. We propose an efficient numerical solution, with controllable error, which first automatically computes an initial value along each cast ray before walking conservatively along a curved ray in the undeformed space according to the signed distance. Importantly, our approach does not require knowledge, computation or even global existence of the inverse deformation, which allows us to readily apply many existing forward deformations.

As the optimizations reside in different stages such as input seed selection and mutation, it is tempting to combine the optimizations in different stages. However, our initial attempts demonstrate that naive combination actually worsens the performance, which explains that most optimizations are still isolated by stages and metrics. In this paper, we present InteFuzz, the first framework that synergically integrates multiple fuzzing optimizations. We analyze the root cause for performance degradation in naive combination, and discover optimizations conflict in coverage criteria and optimization granularity. To resolve the conflicts, we propose a novel priority-based scheduling mechanism. The dynamic integration considers both branch-based and block-based coverage feedbacks that are used by most fuzzing optimizations. In our evaluation, we extract four optimizations from popular fuzzers such as AFLFast and FairFuzz and compare InteFuzz against naive combinations.

The development of EDModel is based on two users studies that have explored how factors such as target size, movement amplitude, and target depth affect the endpoint distribution. The model is built from the collected data and its generalizability is subsequently tested in complex scenarios with more relaxed conditions. Three applications of EDModel inspired by previous research are evaluated to show the broad applicability and usefulness of the model: Correcting the bias in Fitts's law, predicting selection accuracy, and enhancing pointing selection techniques.

On the other hand, a lossy backhaul scenario where high packet losses over the backhaul transmission medium can render backhaul links unavailable for service consumption.

The scheme can use several measuring mechanisms such as continuous Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) testing between core network and base stations, GTP-U user plane echo requests/replies or backhaul quality testing during evolved Packet System Radio Access Bearer (eRAB) establishment phase. This mechanism can also be applied to X2 interface between base stations to reduce the service latency and improve the backhaul link performance. Our simulation results using ns-3 indicate that by applying the proposed strategy in backhaul systems, the application level packet loss and TCP delay can be improved at the expense of the bandwidth improvement at certain drop or loss levels.",60016688,Centre Tecnol√≥gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya,Castelldefels,Spain,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",28.125,-0.14597569097569102,0.5993056943056942,1,0.10408921933085502,0.13011152416356878,0.44
726,746,746,A Traffic Classification Method Based on Packet Transport Layer Payload by Ensemble Learning,"Network traffic classification is an important research topic for computer network, such as QoS detection and admission monitoring. Traditional classification methods, such as port-based and DPI(deep packet inspect)-based, are out-of-date due to the computational expensiveness and inaccuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel traffic classification approach based on packet transport layer payload by ensemble learning. We use three kinds of base neural networks to form a strong classifier. Each model is trained separately and the final prediction result is decided by weight voting. The raw traffic data are reshaped into the format of sequence and matrix as the input, which avoids the TCP stream feature selection and extraction process. Our approach is applicable to both TCP and UDP, which means that it doesn't require a distinction between transport layer protocols. The experiment results show that our approach can reach the high accuracy of 96.38%, and is better than the state-of-the-art methods based on the same dataset. Besides, our proposed model can select packet samples randomly avoiding tracing the whole stream and the model works well even there's packet loss and disorder.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",20.222222222222218,0.002683150183150181,0.598919413919414,1,0.102803738317757,0.02336448598130841,0.2621359223300971
727,747,747,Semisupervised Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Spatial-Spectral Information and Landscape Features,"In hyperspectral image classification, the foremost task is that: how can we apply limited labeled samples to achieve good classification results? Spatial-spectral classification methods, which assign a label to each pixel regarding both spatial and spectral information, are effective to improve classification performance. Moreover, semisupervised learning (SSL) focuses on the scenario that the number of labeled data is rather small while a large number of unlabeled data are available. To complement spatial-spectral classification methods and semisupervised learning for each other, we propose a novel learning landscape features semisupervised framework (LLFSF) based on M-training algorithm and weighted spatial-spectral double layer SVM classifiers module (WSS-DSVM). In this novel framework, we first propose a SLIC (simple linear iterative clustering) based non-local superpixel segmentation algorithm to initially learn landscape feature and spatial composition. Then, we apply WSS-DSVM module to obtain initial classification maps. To better characterize complex scenes of hyperspectral images, we quantizes both the landscape diversity and separability from the initial classification map, which increase availability of spatial details and structural information of objects. Finally, we put some patches with lower accuracy into Multiple-training algorithm for further classification. In order to achieve an unbiased evaluation, we have evaluated the performance of LLFSF on three different scene hyperspectral data sets and compare it with that of three state-of-the-art hyperspectral image classification methods.

728,748,748,MobileEdge: Enhancing On-Board Vehicle Computing Units Using Mobile Edges for CAVs,"As the rapid growth of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and 5G intensifies, more third-party applications are increasingly being deployed on CAVs. They not only improve user experience but also provide more helpful services, for example, enhancing public safety by recognizing criminals in real-Time videos. Current CAVs prefer to process collected data on the vehicle to avoid long transmission latency and extra network cost. However, due to the limitations of the on-board vehicle computing unit (VCU) and increasing use of computing-intensive in-vehicle applications, the burden of on-board VCU has sharply increased, which may affect driving safety. In particular, for existing vehicles on the road, adding more computing devices is a challenge if not impossible due to cost concerns. Inspired by edge computing, we propose a novel platform, MobileEdge, to enhance the computing capability of the unchangeable on-board VCU, which leverages mobile devices as edge nodes, e.g., the passengers' smartphones, by offloading computing tasks to them for collaboratively computing. Moreover, MobileEdge provides the dynamic management of mobile devices, monitoring device status and interfaces for customizable task offloading strategies and eventually achieves optimal task scheduling. We build a prototype to demonstrate the designed platform and evaluate three task offloading strategies which were implemented based on the developed interfaces. The results show that MobileEdge significantly reduces the application response latency. Compared with the baseline which does not employ task offloading, the response latency is almost near real-Time when more computing resources are available. In addition, the proposed shortest response latency strategy outperforms the best overall task scheduling among the three strategies.",60013614,Hangzhou Dianzi University,Hangzhou,China,['1708'],23.45454545454545,0.20227272727272727,0.4518939393939394,1,0.13225806451612904,0.016129032258064516,0.4061433447098976

With respect to the smart governance dimension that serves as an important foundation for delivering government-related services, there is limited indicators and the related formula to measure its performance. This research fills the gaps by modelling indicators and formula in the smart governance dimension to support the smart city program.

Evidence from a randomized field study," All rights reserved.Many papers in the literature have analyzed the role search rank plays in influencing user choices for the same product offered through different links. However, the literature has not analyzed whether search position can cause users to change their consumption between two ex ante distinct product categories. We analyze this question in the context of the ongoing public policy debate surrounding the role search engines can play in anti-piracy efforts. Specifically, we analyze whether reducing the prominence of infringing links can impact users choices between legal and infringing content. To do this we design a customized search engine that allows us to manipulate the positions of infringing and legal links in users' search results. We then use this search engine to conduct experiments on a general population of users and on a subset of college-aged users. Our data show that reducing the prominence of infringing links in search results causes users who otherwise would have consumed infringing content to switch their consumption to paid legal content, and that these results hold even among users whose initial search queries express an explicit preference for infringing content. These results suggest that even small changes in the cost of discovering pirated content can have a relatively large impact on user behavior.

734,754,754,Normalization of abbreviation and acronym on microtext in Bahasa Indonesia by using dictionary-based and longest common subsequence (LCS),"The communication nowadays has reached a need to express the idea in short text. This kind of communication is delivered in various media such as short messages service (SMS), Facebook status, Twitter post, chat messages, comments, and any form of short text. These various kinds of short text are known as microtext. The microtext usually has one sentence or less, written informally, consists of abbreviations, acronyms, emoticons, hashtags, and others. These features of the microtext become a particular challenge to the text classification. These features cannot be processed directly as in the traditional text processing, because it may lead to inaccuracy. Therefore, it requires microtext normalization to transform these features into well-written texts before applying text processing. This research aims to normalize some of these features, which are abbreviations and acronyms. The normalization applied dictionary-based and longest common subsequence (LCS) approach to the microtext in Bahasa Indonesia. Dictionary-based has shown an excellenct performance instead of LCS. However, it is limited to pre-defined abbreviations and acronyms. Besides, the LCS offers dynamic microtext normalization.

These photos are taken from various camera types, and under a vast range of angles and lighting conditions. We present a deep learning framework that can fully normalize unconstrained face images, i.e., remove perspective distortions, relight to an evenly lit environment, and predict a frontal and neutral face. Our method can produce a high resolution image while preserving important facial details and the likeness of the subject, along with the original background. We divide this ill-posed problem into three consecutive normalization steps, each using a different generative adversarial network that acts as an image generator. Perspective distortion removal is performed using a dense flow field predictor. A uniformly illuminated face is obtained using a lighting translation network, and the facial expression is neutralized using a generalized facial expression synthesis framework combined with a regression network based on deep features for facial recognition. We introduce new data representations for conditional inference, as well as training methods for supervised learning to ensure that different expressions of the same person can yield to not only a plausible but also a similar neutral face. We demonstrate our results on a wide range of challenging images collected in the wild. Key applications of our method range from robust image-based 3D avatar creation, portrait manipulation, to facial enhancement and reconstruction tasks for crime investigation.

The former enables user's devices to collect and share data in urban environments. The latter shifts the computation close to end users, lightening the work that their devices have to perform to communicate sensed data in the Cloud. In a fog-based MCS campaign a large number of devices with heterogeneous resources executes sensing tasks generally distributed by remote servers. A careful selection of some of these users' devices for sensing operations can bring benefits to the whole platform in terms of computational costs and energy saving. In this paper, we propose a novel users' recruitment model based on distance, computational capacity, and residual battery of devices. The selection process is carried out in a scenario where devices of the MCS campaign periodically share their battery and Central Processing Unit status to fog nodes through their short-range communication interfaces. Based on this information, fog nodes select devices suitable for performing specific tasks. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compare our solution with a selection model based only on distances, using an MCS simulator suitably modified for fog-based scenarios as testbed.

This study aims to investigate the effect of hot mix asphalt additives on the resilient modulus (Mr) of crumb rubber (CR) and Buton natural asphalt (BNA)-modified asphalt mixes. Two different HMA additives were used to fabricate HMA specimens. The hot mix asphalt used asphalt Pen 60/70, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and filler obtained from the stone crusher machine.

743,763,763,Adversarial monte carlo denoising with conditioned auxiliary feature modulation,"Denoising Monte Carlo rendering with a very low sample rate remains a major challenge in the photo-realistic rendering research. Many previous works, including regression-based and learning-based methods, have been explored to achieve better rendering quality with less computational cost. However, most of these methods rely on handcrafted optimization objectives, which lead to artifacts such as blurs and unfaithful details. In this paper, we present an adversarial approach for denoising Monte Carlo rendering. Our key insight is that generative adversarial networks can help denoiser networks to produce more realistic high-frequency details and global illumination by learning the distribution from a set of high-quality Monte Carlo path tracing images.We also adapt a novel feature modulation method to utilize auxiliary features better, including normal, albedo and depth.

744,764,764,Person Re-Identification via Contextual Region-Based Metric Learning in Camera Sensor Networks,"Person re-identification in camera sensor networks is a challenging issue due to significant appearance variations of pedestrian images captured by different camera sensors. The contextual information of pedestrian images is a vital cue to overcome appearance variations. However, many existing approaches learn the distance metric in a global way or restrict to corresponding sub-regions, which discards the contextual information of pedestrians or learns the contextual information inadequately. In this paper, we propose an effective method to tackle the problem for person re-identification in camera sensor networks. Firstly, we propose the Contextual Region-based Metric Learning (CRML) to fully learn the contextual information in a local manner, which simultaneously utilizes three kinds of sub-region pairs to learn a discriminative transformation matrix. Secondly, we employ the greedy axis rotation algorithm to optimize the transformation matrix in the framework of mutual information. Thirdly, in the process of local similarity integration, we further propose the Context-Constrained Match (CCM) to overcome the misalignment problem by seeking the optimal match in the neighboring sub-regions. Fourthly, we further present the nCRML to avoid the dimensionality curse and fuse similarity scores in different low-dimensional subspaces. The experimental results on three challenging datasets (VIPeR, QMUL GRID and CUHK03) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",60022149,Tianjin Normal University,Tianjin,China,['1700'],22.66666666666667,0.1473684210526316,0.4149122807017544,1,0.10204081632653061,0.04081632653061224,0.31877729257641924

746,766,766,Impact of Header on Coded Slotted Aloha with Capture,"Among the recently proposed non-orthogonal multiple access techniques, the Coded Slotted Aloha (CSA) scheme has been identified as one of the most efficient ones. This scheme relies on the subdivision of a packet into segments and of a slot into slices, in order to enable the transmission of different segments in different slices. With respect to SA, the CSA implementation is more sophisticated, since the header of each segment must contain proper pointers specifying the slices where the other segments of that packet lie. Purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of these pointers on the CSA throughput by properly considering the capture effect at the receiver. To this aim, a capture analysis accounting for the modulation and the header coding rate in the presence of Rayleigh fading is developed. The numerical results, which also involve a realistic millimeter-wave channel, show that the beneficial interference diversity effect introduced by the segmentation process is not significantly reduced by the overhead due to the pointers, thus confirming the practical usefulness of the CSA scheme.",60018363,Universit√† degli Studi di Trieste,Trieste,Italy,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",29.0,0.0949404761904762,0.4220238095238095,1,0.08762886597938144,0.04639175257731959,0.2736842105263158
747,767,767,Progressive Joint Framework for Chinese Question Entity Discovery and Linking with Question Representations,"Chinese question entity discovery and linking (QEDL) may encounter short texts and small-scale annotated datasets, which may invalidate certain machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a progressive joint framework for Chinese QEDL, which leverages the mutual dependency information of these two tasks to enhance the performance with each other. The framework uses the candidate entity generation (CEG) of entity linking to iteratively augment the overall process of entity discovery that consists of mention generation, filtering and merging modules. In mention generation module, to reduce the hand-crafted effort of the rule-based entity discovery, we develop a question representation method to generate domain-independent entity discovery rules, and use CEG to check the extracted mentions in priority order. This module can embed extracted mentions into other entity discovery methods as one feature or as extra mentions to alleviate insufficiencies of annotated datasets. The mentions filtering module leverages the joint features of extracted mentions and CEG's entities to build a voting model and filter out low-confidence mentions. Moreover, the mentions merging module merges different patterns' mention-entity pairs and check their corresponding candidate entities with CEG. During entity linking, we incorporate the joint features of questions, extracted mentions and CEG's entities into a ranking model for entity disambiguation. Finally, we conduct experiments on two real datasets and compare our approach with other state-of-the-art methods. The results illustrate that the proposed framework can reduce error accumulation and flexibly combine different entity discovery methods, which significantly improves the performance on small-scale datasets.",60027363,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1700'],24.7,0.029591836734693875,0.39081632653061227,1,0.15202702702702703,0.02364864864864865,0.34057971014492755
748,768,768,Performance Evaluation of UWB Massive MIMO Channels with Favorable Propagation Features,"Radio wave propagation can be characterized by two major sets: empirical and deterministic models. Empirical models rely on the received signals' statistics and thus offer lower precision. Deterministic models have certain physical bases and therefore necessitate a massive amount of geometrical data. For instance, the ray-based technique represents a suitable facility for reliable estimations in indoor schemes. Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology allows transmitting signals over a huge bandwidth, typically in the order of 500 MHz to several GHz enabling the design of communication systems with very high data rates. Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a new technique, utilizing a large number of base station antennas, advancing large system capacities in multiuser schemes, where multiple users are simultaneously served in the same time-frequency resources. We develop a ray-based procedure to investigate the behavior of the downlink UWB massive MIMO channel including the antennas transfer functions under various typical propagation situations. We estimate the magnitude and the phase of the voltage induced at each receiving antenna as a function of frequency (through the reciprocity theorem). We compare the singular value spread (SVS) cumulative distribution function (CDF) of each situation while varying the number of base station antennas. As the number of base station antennas or the inter-user separation increase, both the SVS and the sum-rate improve, the channel becomes more favorable, where better spatial separation is provided, and the disparity of the power values allocated for the users' channels reduces (through water-filling).

In the paper, the Geometrical Dilution of Precision (GDOP) was used as criteria to make a preliminary assessment of the global availability of the four GNSS in 2019, including a single navigation system and a combination of multiple navigation systems. The benefits of their combinations are investigated: The combination of dual-system and three-system can reduce the average value of GDOP to 1.0-1.5, which can make the user positioning have better performance. Particularly, GPS+GLONASS+BDS+Galileo supplies higher performances compared to the other combination, and the GDOP value in more than 80% areas is less than 1.

Angkutan Kota (City Transport) is a mode of transportation with a predetermined route set by the government. The price of goods delivery is influenced by a number of factors. This research aims to solve this problem using fuzzy logic system, using it will be built an automated system to calculate the transportation price needed to be paid by the customer. The rate is determined by taking into consideration the dimension of the goods and the number of angkot used. This is done because fuzzy logic system can solve problems related to calculation system that is not detailed about changes in the input. The method used in this fuzzy logic system is Tsukamoto's. This system weights on the factors that influence the rate to calculate the accurate number. With the existence of this rate calculation system, it is hoped that the rate determined will be accurate and could maintain the rate in the normal range of angkot usage, which is economical.

The knowledge based G2P is built based on linguist knowledge. The data-driven approach such as the statistical approach on the other hand does not need expert knowledge, but it requires data to learn the rules. In this research, we propose an approach that combines linguistic knowledge into a statistical-based G2P convertor for Khmer. We examined a simple way of adding linguistic knowledge into the statistical G2P convertor by simply inserting vowel tags into a Khmer word. Three types of vowel tags were used. The main strength of this approach is it combines the strength of linguistic knowledge and statistical-based approach, to build a robust G2P model. The information allows better modeling and prediction of the phoneme sequence, thus improving the phoneme error rate (PER) and word error rate (WER).

However, the conventional routing methods cannot overcome the large gap between different performance requirements of flow and efficient resource allocation. Therefore, this paper proposes DRL-R (Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Routing) to bridge this gap. First, we recombine multiple resources (node's cache, link's bandwidth) by quantifying the contribution score of them reducing the delay. This actually converts the performance requirements of flow into resource requirements of this flow, hence, the routing problem can be converted into a job-scheduling problem in resource management. Second, a DRL agent deployed on an SDN controller continually interacts with the network for adaptively performing reasonable routing according to the network state, and optimally allocating network resources for traffic. We employ Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to build the DRL-R. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRL-R through extensive simulations. Benefitted from continually learning with a global view, DRL-R can improve throughput highest up to 40% and flow completion time highest up to 47% over OSPF. DRL-R can improve the load balance of link highest up to 18.8% over OSPF.

Medical data are heterogeneous which involves images to a great extent like MRI, ECG or Stroke effects etc. Knowledge discovery from such data can improve the diagnostic technique. However, to make the machine learn from such datasets requires large data. In the low-data regime, machine learning algorithms work poorly. Data Augmentation alleviates this by using existing data more effectively, but standard data augmentation produces only limited alternative data. Recent developments in Deep Learning field is noteworthy when it comes to learning probability distribution of points through neural networks, and one of key part for such progress is because of Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs). In this paper, we propose an evolutionary training technique using a cultural algorithm(CA) for neuro-evolution of deep task oriented GANs to find the best architecture for the given dataset. This architecture will help in generating similar but completely new data images which can be further used for training diagnostic Neural Networks.

763,783,783,Machine Learning-based SON function conflict resolution,"With the advent of 5G, it is expected that the heterogeneity of networks will increase significantly. This is due to the coexistence of different radio access technologies, service-specific requirements for different slices, combined with a multitude of conflicting optimization goals including, coverage, capacity, various QoS requirements, energy savings, etc. This complexity results in an explosion of the optimization space, which turns the network management into an intractable problem. In order to solve this, we introduce cognitive capabilities into the network to discover the dynamics between different SON functions (SF) and then automatically derive rules to coordinate them without explicit human modeling.

Information sent by or to the vehicle can be life-critical (e.g. breaking, acceleration, cruise control, emergency communication, etc ...). As vehicular technology advances, in-vehicle networks are connected to external networks through 3 and 4G mobile networks, enabling manufacturer and customer monitoring of different aspects of the car.

Yet, the potential of HMIS has been difficult to materialize in the LMIC context since routines and practices that work against effective use of HMIS are often deeply embedded in historical institutions and, consequently, are difficult to change. Using a longitudinal case study of HMIS in Kenya, we investigate the crucial role of identity work as a mechanism that links information technology (IT) affordances to institutions. In particular, our study revealed four types of identity work (disruptive, legitimizing, reinforcing, and transformative) that, through different affordances, led to distinct institutional consequences in terms of either maintaining or deinstitutionalizing existing dysfunctional HMIS-related routines and practices.

This issue should be considered on deployed C-ITS (Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems) in order to avoid tracking drivers who send continously messages containing their locations. The anonymity is ensured by changing the identity of drivers frequently. In addition to anonymity, authentication is highly required. An adapted PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) solves this issue. Each vehicle has a set of pseudonyms certificates (PC) which will be used to sign sent messages and will be used as a part of the driver id. Getting PCs from the PKI requires a reliable network for a period of time and is constrained for vehicles. Each vehicle manages a list of PCs dynamically. A PC is used for a limited period of time. When this period expires, the vehicle will use another PC. This paper proposes a method which reduces the number of PCs used by vehicles. Indeed, when a certificate is used by a vehicle, in order to introduce a confusion for any tracker, this PC will be exchanged with another driver PC. A tracker will be confused since the former vehicle will not be the owner of the previous PC. This exchange has to be recorded on the PKI with simple processes. This mechanism protects privacy and introduces another PC change method. It also reduces the PC costs for drivers.

784,806,806,A location-Aware duty cycle approach toward energy-efficient mobile crowdsensing,"This paper aims to explore the problem of energy economy of mobile devices in the Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) scenario. The neighbor scanning mechanism of mobile devices usually consumes most of the energy in multi-hop message transmission. Traditional mechanisms such as chaotic neighbor detection and continuous neighbor discovery, can easily exhaust the limited energy. Since they are actually unnecessarily considering the strong correlation between the transmission opportunity and the social characteristics. Therefore, diminishing energy consumption is of key importance toward energy-efficient MCS. Sleeping strategy stands out as a promising approach to improve energy efficiency and hold the the network metrics in MCS applications, while challenges still lie in achieving effective scheduling given the changing environment. In this study, we proposed a novel self-Adapt sleeping scheduling approach based on the correlation between the pedestrian's own historical trajectory and geographic grid information for energy saving (ESGeo). As the grid-based method can well record the encounter characteristics of nodes, ESGeo is able to pick flexible duty-cycling strategies for mobile devices in each distinguishable grid. This enables, mobile devices to avoid excessive scanning in low-probability encounter areas.

Automating this step enables a project to produce quality results. We categorized issue reports to derive a specific classification of issue reports of pull-based development projects.

All rights reserved.In the present course, the so-called conservation of agriculture is a term of the information. Though we have not reached the improvement of agriculture in Tamil Nadu, there have been many benefits in agriculture in neighbouring states. India was the first to establish agriculture in the province. But its expansion has not arrived at a satisfactory stage. The reason for this is that it generates a revulsion for the people on agriculture. Farmers could not get the wage from the profession. They do not determine the price of their agricultural produce. This will make the agricultural industry deviate from their profession. We have given a great solution to this problem based on a series of studies to give it a decisive solution in our paper. How many crops have been allocated to agriculture for the past 10 years from the Tamil Nadu Government in which the farmer has produced the crops and the favors he has carried out, we have made this by incorporating a machinery to produce them the right amount of income. We have divided our paper into four categories one way to find out they cultivate which types of crops in the field via satellite, and the other irrigation information from the field, the second approach of intelligence sharing using satellite transmissions.

In this paper, a sparse polarization sensitive FDA-MIMO radar with co-prime frequency offsets (SPS-CopFDA-MIMO radar) is proposed and a fast parameter estimation algorithm based on propagator method is developed. In receiver, the SPS-CopFDA-MIMO radar introduces full component electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) spaced much farther apart than a half-wavelength to achieve aperture extension, therefore provides high accuracy and unambiguous estimates of angle and polarization. In transmitter, the SPS-CopFDA-MIMO radar utilizes co-prime frequency offsets to enhance range resolution without decreasing the maximum unambiguous range. In the proposed algorithm, the angle, polarization, and range are estimated successively. First, polarization diversity is utilized to resolve the phase ambiguity induced by the sparse receiving array. Then, the polarization parameters are estimated based on these estimated angle parameters.

799,821,821,ALSR: An Adaptive Label Screening and Relearning Approach for Anomaly Detection,"Anomaly detection using KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) is key to AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations). Recent anomaly detection approaches have adopted machine learning to detect anomalies on the perspective of individual time points more than events. These approaches do not make effective use of the labels of continuous anomaly intervals, nor do they pay attention to the differences among anomaly points. The detection performance is therefore not high enough. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach named ALSR, which uses a label screening model and a relearning model to analyze and utilize the continuous anomaly intervals of KPIs in finer granularity. The label screening algorithm takes advantage of the continuity of anomaly intervals to remove unnecessary data from the training set, so as to better suit to interval-oriented anomaly detection. The relearning algorithm reclassifies the true/false positive points within range of detected anomalies, thus effectively reduces the number of false positive points. ALSR uses statistical characteristics and time series models for feature extraction, and the feature set is proved to better describe the characteristics of KPIs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 25 KPIs, and the total F-score of ALSR is 0.965, which outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",22.222222222222218,0.09850267379679144,0.6547593582887701,1,0.11587982832618025,0.06437768240343347,0.34841628959276016

As patient's data comprises of a huge amount of text documents in a non-standardized format. In order to obtain the relevant data, the text documents pose a lot of challenging issues for data processing. Topic modeling is one of the popular techniques for information retrieval based on themes from the biomedical documents. In topic modeling discovering the precise topics from the biomedical documents is a challenging task. Furthermore, in biomedical text documents, the redundancy puts a negative impact on the quality of text mining as well. Therefore, the rapid growth of unstructured documents entails machine learning techniques for topic modeling capable of discovering precise topics. In this paper, we proposed a topic modeling technique for text mining through hybrid inverse document frequency and machine learning fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm. The proposed technique ameliorates the redundancy issue and discovers precise topics from the biomedical text documents. The proposed technique generates local and global term frequencies through the bag-of-words (BOW) model. The global term weighting is calculated through the proposed hybrid inverse documents frequency and Local term weighting is computed with term frequency. The robust principal component analysis is used to remove the negative impact of higher dimensionality on the global term weights. Afterward, the classification and clustering for text mining are performed with a probability of topics in the documents. The classification is performed through discriminant analysis classifier whereas the clustering is done through the k-means clustering. The performance of clustering is evaluated with Calinsiki-Har-abasz (CH) index internal validation method. The proposed toping modeling technique is evaluated on six standard datasets namely Ohsumed, MuchMore Springer Corpus, GENIA corpus, Bioxtext, tweets and WSJ redundant corpus for experimentation.

An effective way is to store sensitive data in the hidden volume of mobile devices with Plausibly Deniable Encryption (PDE) systems. Typically, PDE creates a hidden volume inside the outer volume. However, existing PDE systems could lose data, due to overriding the hidden volume, and significantly waste physical storage, because of the fixedly reserved area for the hidden volume. In this paper, we present MobiGyges to solve the above problems. MobiGyges leverages the Thin Pool to coordinate the storage allocation for both the outer volume and the hidden volume which avoids data override and prevents data loss. Moreover, it improves the storage efficiency by virtualizing the total physical storage into small storage blocks and utilizing the blocks for the outer volume and the hidden volume, which eliminates the reserved area.

The LoRaWAN developed by the LoRa Alliance is a long-range wide area network specification suitable for an IoT environment due to its low-power communication. It provides a star-of-stars topology, well-defined MAC layer protocol and three communication modes to further lower its power consumption and employs the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptography and several session keys to increase its network security. However, for battery powered IoT end nodes, the AES encryption process consumes some amounts of power owing to involving multiple cycles of repetition. To solve this problem, in this study, we propose a low power consumed AES encryption architecture, named Low-Power AES Data Encryption Architecture (LPADA), which reduces the power consumed by the AES for data encryption by using low power SBox, power gating technique and power management method. A key updating procedure is also proposed to increase the security of the session-key renewal. The system is simulated using the Synopsys library with five different supply voltages. The experimental results show that 62.0% of dynamic power reduction and 88.5% of leakage power lowering have been achieved compared to the power consumed by traditional AES data encryption.

807,830,830,A Routing Metric for Inter-flow Interference-aware Flying Multi-hop Networks,"The growing demand for broadband communications anytime, anywhere has paved the way to the usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for providing Internet access in areas without network infrastructure and enhancing the performance of existing networks. However, the usage of Flying Multi-hop Networks (FMNs) in such scenarios brings up significant challenges concerning network routing, in order to permanently provide the Quality of Service expected by the users. The problem is exacerbated in crowded events, where the FMN may be formed by many UAVs to address the traffic demand, causing inter-flow interference within the FMN. Typically, estimating inter-flow interference is not straightforward and requires the exchange of probe packets, thus increasing network overhead.The main contribution of this paper is an inter-flow interference-aware routing metric, named I2R, designed for centralized routing in FMNs with controllable topology. I2R does not require any control packets and enables the configuration of paths with minimal Euclidean distance formed by UAVs with the lowest number of neighbors in carrier-sense range, thus minimizing inter-flow interference in the FMN. Simulation results show the I2R superior performance, with significant gains in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay, when compared with state of the art routing metrics.",60020432,"Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science",Porto,Portugal,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",32.66666666666667,0.15625,0.5858333333333333,1,0.1092436974789916,0.037815126050420166,0.38073394495412843

However, it is challenging because traffic flows are affected by multiple complex factors, such as spatial and temporal dependencies of regions and external factors. In this paper, we propose a deep hybrid spatio-Temporal dynamic neural network, called DHSTNet, to predict both inflows and outflows in every region of a city. More specifically, it consists of four main components, i.e., closeness influence taking the instantaneous variations of traffic flows, period influence regularly identifying daily changes of traffic crowd flows, weekly component identifying the patterns of weekly traffic flows and external component acquiring external factors. We design a branch of deep hybrid recurrent convolutional neural network units to model the first three temporal properties, i.e., closeness, period influence, and weekly influence. The external components are feed into two fully connected neural networks. For different branches, our proposed model assigns different weights and then combines the output of the four components.

However, the performance of DNS caches will be remarkably influenced by disposable domain names, which are generated by services of cloud storage, social networks, etc., and belong to a new class of misused case of DNS. In this paper, we proposed a novel solution named DC3 (Domain Classification and Cascade Cache) to mitigate the negative impact. Domain Classification adopts a classifier which is based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to prevent disposable domains from being cached. Cascade Cache is a refined cascade LRU policy considering cache size allocation to process the remaining disposable domains. By querying the real DNS traces collected from a large ISP network, experiment results show that this solution can detect disposable domain names and mitigate their negative impacts on DNS caches effectively. Specifically, in our dataset, 67.4% of all distinct domain names are detected as disposable domain names. Correspondingly, when getting rid of them by using this solution, we can raise the cache hit rate more than double.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",21.625,0.19107559107559108,0.4461371961371961,1,0.15,0.07,0.38071065989847713

Detectability index is derived from signal detection theory as applied to imaging systems and is used to estimate the ability of a system to statistically distinguish objects, most notably in the medical imaging and defense fields. A brief overview of CDP and detectability index is given after which an imaging model is developed to compare and explore the behavior of each with respect to camera parameters.

Unlike prior preservation systems, our system design allows nodes to be dispersed across multiple administrative domains, thus eliminating single points of trust and at the same time, is the first to monitor how content changes both over time and across geographical location. Watchdog achieves Byzantine fault-Tolerance via a novel interactive consistency algorithm that offers a twist on the traditional definition and use of interactive consistency; the algorithm enables a set of mutually suspicious nodes, with arbitrary-sized, potentially overlapping data collections, to efficiently agree on the exact data collection in possession by each node.

Our framework is based on a novel discretization of the immersed boundary equations of motion, which model fluid and deformables as a single incompressible medium and their interaction as a unified system on a fixed domain combining Eulerian and Lagrangian terms. One advantage for real-time simulations resulting from this modeling is that two-way coupling phenomena can be faithfully simulated while avoiding costly calculations such as tracking the deforming fluid-solid interfaces and the associated fluid boundary conditions. Our discretization enables the combination of a PIC/FLIP fluid solver with a reduced-order Lagrangian elasticity solver. Crucial for the performance of RIM is the efficient transfer of information between the elasticity and the fluid solver and the synchronization of the Lagrangian and Eulerian settings. We introduce the concept of twin subspaces that enables an efficient reduced-order modeling of the transfer. Our experiments demonstrate that RIM handles complex meshes and highly resolved fluids for large time steps at high framerates on of-the-shelf hardware, even in the presence of high velocities and rapid user interaction.

On the other hand, the SC server usually intends to finish all tasks with a low cost. Considering these factors, in this paper, we study a Bi-Objective Task Planning (BOTP) problem in SC, where the workers are assigned and scheduled to perform the appropriate tasks, such that the workers' familiarity with the locations of the spatial tasks and the SC server's cost for recruiting workers are jointly optimized. We prove that the BOTP problem is NP-hard and thus intractable. To tackle the BOTP problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on the multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm.

For the uncertain moving obstacles, we calculate the extra cost for avoiding in the second-stage after the distribution of moving obstacles is known, and add this part of the cost to the first-stage to ensure the overall reconfiguration cost is minimized.

However, cloud-based training has several problems such as network bottleneck, server management cost, and privacy. To overcome these problems, one of the most promising solutions is distributed DNN model training which trains the model with not only high-performance servers but also low-end power-efficient mobile edge or user devices. However, due to the lack of a framework which can provide an optimal cluster configuration (i.e., determining which computing devices participate in DNN training tasks), it is difficult to perform efficient DNN model training considering DNN service providers' preferences such as training time or energy efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for distributed DNN training that determines the best training cluster configuration with available heterogeneous computing resources. Our proposed framework utilizes pre-Training with a small number of training steps and estimates training time, power, energy, and energy-delay product (EDP) for each possible training cluster configuration.

The technology provides the most important information partition for disaster management applications for Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET). Wireless communication is required among rescue team members to save countless lives and use them in rescue operations. They use the technology with mobile connectivity technology for it, as well as Quality of Service (QoS). Emergency and disaster recovery will be designed to operate on the battery-powered devices for use during the service, as well as good and possible among rescue members, such as MANET devices. The node must be able to communicate its information to another node, without depending on anything. Through this, the rescue team will exchange the multimedia video and images for the rescue scene they are committed. However, during such a disaster recovery process, most QoS routing protocols do not exchange information on a multimedia streaming system, which is necessary for the current era. Existing protocols cannot meet this requirement. Our proposed work is reliable and achieves speedy communication for upcoming emergency RESCUE protocol for recovery management. Instead of relying on a greedy node to deal with unforeseen conditions during or after a disaster, or by designing the entire transmission model that operates the MANET, the recovery routing protocol selects a group of team members for each hop-by-hop. The movement of the nodes is not predetermined and varies according to time and place, and the node used to obtain information from nearby nodes. The recovery protocol is structured with the forecast technique. Instead of guessing the exact location of the adjacent node of each node, the node predicts the elliptical portion that is likely to move the tracked node and guess the rescue protocol. By minimizing the impact of a location error, the node antenna uses a predicted ellipse region to locate the affected area in a specific direction and transmit the packets in the right direction to the adjacent node. The existing routing protocol Topology and Link quality-aware Geographical opportunistic routing protocol (TLG) is compared with RESCUE routing protocol and its results compared and justified it.",60005630,"National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli",Tiruchirappalli,India,['1700'],20.94117647058824,0.21865079365079365,0.6089285714285715,1,0.12871287128712872,0.03712871287128713,0.26785714285714285

A robust matching algorithm is proposed to reliably project the selected point in the reference image into the live images of a quadrotor helicopter. Projective transformations are applied to the reference image to extract additional keypoints and to gain invariance to out-of-plane perspective transformations. Since the matching algorithm does not exploit the beneficial characteristics of image sequences and because its processing time is not short enough for high frame rates, a tracking algorithm is introduced. High detection rates even for image sequences with large viewpoint changes are achieved. Therefore, the presented algorithm can be used as input to a guidance algorithm for UAVs.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,['1700'],21.5,0.15294990723562152,0.5012244897959184,1,0.10273972602739725,0.0136986301369863,0.2765957446808511

However, due to the lack of undistorted images for a reference, the accuracy of the no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) cannot compete with that of the full-reference IQA (FR-IQA). To bridge the performance gap between the FR-IQA and NR-IQA methods, we propose a NR-IQA method based on multi-task generative adversarial network, which attempts to restore dependable hallucinated images to compensate for the missing corresponding reference images. Two tasks, hallucination images and the quality maps are outputted by the generator and are combined with the specific loss to improve the reliability of hallucination images. Besides, two discriminator networks are used to respectively distinguish the undistorted images and hallucination images pairs, quality maps and structural similarity index measurement maps pairs. Finally, the hallucination images and distorted images are input into the IQA network, and quality scores are evaluated based on the differences between them.

840,864,864,A novel framework for inverse procedural texture modeling,"Procedural textures are powerful tools that have been used in graphics for decades. In contrast to the alternative exemplar-based texture synthesis techniques, procedural textures provide user control and fast texture generation with low-storage cost and unlimited texture resolution. However, creating procedural models for complex textures requires a time-consuming process of selecting a combination of procedures and parameters. We present an example-based framework to automatically select procedural models and estimate parameters. In our framework, we consider textures categorized by commonly used high level classes. For each high level class we build a data-driven inverse modeling system based on an extensive collection of real-world textures and procedural texture models in the form of node graphs. We use unsupervised learning on collected real-world images in a texture class to learn sub-classes. We then classify the output of each of the collected procedural models into these sub-classes. For each of the collected models we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the parameters to produce a specific output texture. To use our framework, a user provides an exemplar texture image within a high level class. The system first classifies the texture into a sub-class, and selects the procedural models that produce output in that sub-class. The pre-trained CNNs of the selected models are used to estimate the parameters of the texture example. With the predicted parameters, the system can generate appropriate procedural textures for the user. The user can easily edit the textures by adjusting the node graph parameters. In a last optional step, style transfer augmentation can be applied to the fitted procedural textures to recover details lost in the procedural modeling process. We demonstrate our framework for four high level classes and show that our inverse modeling system can produce high-quality procedural textures for both structural and non-structural textures.",60005455,Yale University,New Haven,United States,['1704'],18.625,0.11488888888888887,0.4567777777777778,1,0.14245014245014245,0.005698005698005698,0.2848297213622291

Federated micro-clouds are promising for solving problem of service delivery in this dynamic scenario. However, due to the harsh environment and the dynamic feature of federated micro-clouds, there is a serious risk of service failure. Redundant configuration is an effective method to enhance service reliability. But when determining the placement strategy for an application request containing multiple services, few previous approaches can effectively handle such a highly complex task of redundant services placement under multiple constraints, including resource constraints, communication delay limits and location constraints. In this paper, we study how to reliably place redundant services requested by user on federated micro-clouds. We first design a two-level reliability evaluation model to quantitatively measure the reliability of each services placement from the two aspects of node reliability and Shared Risk Domain (SRD) reliability. Second, we propose a Reliable Redundant Services Placement (RRSP) approach to iteratively place each service by using Dynamic Graph Growth (DGG) algorithm.

The network is still an asynchronous distributed system in rule updates. If the update operations are not carefully scheduled, it may result in blackhole, congestions, and violate the consistency properties. Motivated by the tightly synchronized SDNs, we proposed TIDERS Algorithm for consistent network updates in 'timed SDNs'-where one node update can be scheduled at specific time. In TIDERS, we use synchronized time technique to achieve fast network updates while guaranteeing consistency properties. We focus on congestion-free in scheduling the update operations. To achieve this, we first set up a flow-based dependency graph and transform it into switch-operation level dependency graph.

849,873,873,BGP Dataset Generation and Feature Extraction for Anomaly Detection,"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the default Internet routing protocol that manages connectivity among Autonomous Systems (ASes). Although BGP disruptions are rare, when they occur the consequences can be very damaging. Due to the importance of this problem there has been a considerable effort aimed at understanding what is normal and abnormal BGP traffic and, in doing so, enable potentially disruptive anomalous traffic to be quickly identified and mitigate its effects. Recent efforts indicate that machine learning (ML) techniques are capable of achieving a high level of accuracy and robustness in anomaly detection. However, even though there are public datasets of BGP messages, these are not suited to feed ML models directly, because the goal of these messages is to exchange fine-grained reachability information instead of observe network behavior. Thus, in order to apply ML methods to BGP control plane data, the data must be preprocessed and features extracted to a format that is suited to be used as input to ML models (e.g. labelled tabular data). In this work, we implemented a dataset generation tool that extracts relevant features from BGP control plane messages along with tools that assist the labelling of the anomaly period. Our tool extracts volume and AS path features most commonly used by anomaly detection techniques, as well as novel distribution features that allow the observation of BGP traffic changes in a straightforward manner. We used this tool to analyze 9 anomaly events through 27 points of observation and generated 81 datasets, with a total of 86,400 samples. The generated datasets and source code of the developed tool were made publicly available, for extension and reusability. Additionally, we analyzed which trends in BGP behavior can be used to distinguish regular traffic from anomalies and different types of anomalies.",60000943,Universidade Federal do Amazonas,Manaus,Brazil,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",24.5,0.1496969696969697,0.4969813519813521,1,0.13109756097560976,0.04573170731707317,0.3547400611620795

Resource allocation problem is a main challenge for wireless virtualization for which auction approaches have been widely used. However, for most existing auction-based allocation schemes, the objective is to maximize the social welfare (i.e., the sum of all valuations of winning bidders) due to its simplicity. While in reality, MVNOs are more interested in maximizing their own revenues. However, the revenue-maximization auction problem is much more complex since the price is unknown before calculation. In this paper, we give a first attempt for designing a revenueoptimal auction mechanism for resource allocation in wireless virtualization. Considering the complexity in revenue maximization, we apply the deep learning techniques. Specifically, we construct a multi-layer feed-forward neural network based on the analysis of optimal auction design. The neural network adopts users' bids as the input and the allocation rule and conditional payment rule for the users as the output. The training set of this neural network is the users' valuation profiles. The proposed auction mechanism possesses several satisfactory properties, e.g., individual rationality and incentive compatibility.

In Indonesia, the most common diabetes microvascular complications diseases are retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. In order to prevent these complications to manifest, data mining technique to extract knowledge of risk factor for each complication becomes crucial. The goal of this research is to construct a prediction model for three major diabetes complication diseases in Indonesia and find out the significant features correlated with it. In this research, the diabetes risk factor narrowed into seven features, which are Age, Gender, BMI, Family history of diabetes, Blood pressure, duration of diabetes suffers and Blood glucose level. Thus, Naive Bayes Tree and C4.5 decision tree-based classification techniques and k-means clustering techniques were used to analyze this dataset. After this analysis, we evaluated the performance of each technique and found the correlated feature and sub feature as a disease risk factor for them. Resulting the most influential risk factor for Retinopathy is a female patient that having a hypertension crisis. As for Nephropathy, the most prominent risk factor is the duration of diabetes more than 4 years. But for Neuropathy, it dominated for female patients, with BMI more than 25.

859,883,883,FILM: Fine-grained book localization with mobile RFID scanning,"Misshelving is an age-old problem in a library. If this happens, users can hardly find their wanted books, leading to a waste of book resources. In this paper, we investigate the problem of book localization through mobile RFID scanning. According to extensive experiments, we find that the phase data (that are used to do localization) beyond the reader antenna's main lobe are noisy; taking these data as the input of book localization is likely to lower the localization accuracy. However, it is not easy to figure out which data are noisy. To address this problem, we propose a fine-grained localization method called FILM, which can achieve cm-level book localization through the following three steps. First, it collects the phase profile for each tagged book as is. Second, it sophisticatedly chooses three samples from the phase profile and locates the tagged book by modeling the three samples. Since there are a great number of 3-combinations, we can get many candidates of the book localization. Third, it uses the Gaussian kernel density model to determine whether the candidates are good or not. The basic idea is that, the noisy data give rise to uncertain estimates, whereas the clean data will always get an estimate close to the ground truth. Therefore, the position with the highest density is the most likely to be the tag's position. By this means, the noisy data do not contribute to the final estimate, which improves the localization accuracy. We setup a prototype of FILM and experiment results show that FILM is superior to the state-of-The-Art, with a small localization error of 1.3cm.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,['1708'],18.928571428571427,0.16785714285714284,0.5214285714285714,1,0.11146496815286625,0.01592356687898089,0.26578073089701

861,885,885,An efficient and transparent approach for adaptive intra-And inter-node virtual machine communication in virtualized clouds,"Network I/O workloads are dominating as one of the leading costs for most of the virtualized clouds. One way to improve the inter virtual machine (VM) inefficiency is to build shared memory channels between VMs co-located on the same physical node to by-pass traditional TCP/IP network stack, so that the overhead is reduced by shorter communication path and fewer kernel interactions. However, it is a key challenge for existing work to achieve high performance inter-VM communication while keeping the capability of VM live migration, and most of existing work are neither seamlessly agile in the presence of VM live migration nor transparent to upper users as well as to operating system kernels, which limits the application of current co-location aware shared-memory based approaches. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of XenVMC, an adaptive and transparent inter-VM communication system for high performance network I/O in virtualized clouds. With proposed dynamic co-located VM membership update mechanism, XenVMC is applicable not only to intra-node VM communication, but also to cross-node communication. It also supports adaptive switching between shared-memory based channel and traditional network-based channel in case of VM live migration, with the aid of proposed VM migration perception and handling mechanisms. XenVMC enables efficient data transmission for both TCP and UDP workloads, with multilevel transparency guaranteed. Extensive experiments show that XenVMC achieves better performance for both TCP and UDP workloads with high transparency, compared with both native virtualized environment and representative existing work.

However, the latest development of CPU architecture has brought new issues to page coloring. Firstly, in the case of three-level cache, previous works about page coloring did not discuss the impact on L2 cache of color allocation and the competition for L2 cache is not considered concurrently under hyper-Threading. In addition, as the last level cache structure is changed from shared to slice-based and undocumented hash function is applied, page coloring is more complex and slice information is also not fully utilized. This paper presents solutions to these issues. Firstly, by making small changes to the traditional page coloring, the problem that page coloring may waste L2 cache is alleviated. At the same time, we rethink the vertical allocation of L2 cache and LLC in page coloring under hyper-Threading, and discuss the impact of color allocation on programs, especially those with different sensitivity to L2 cache and LLC. Finally, we make full use of slice information and propose Partial Conflict Color (PCC). At the same time, we also propose a fast method to obtain PCC.

To handle this data volume, big data architectures, based on stream computing paradigm, are usually adopted. Within this paradigm, data are continuously processed by a set of operators (elementary operations) instances. Further, a streaming application can be modeled as a directed graph where vertices are operators instances and edges are data streams (i.e., continuous series of tuples, generated by an operator). The central challenge when developing streaming applications is the way to assign operators to given resources for optimal performances (i.e., resource allocation). We showed that straightforward allocation, when based on intrinsic data parallelism, do not yield satisfying results. We developed a novel approach that takes into account the specifics of the target application, on the one hand, and on the other hand the systems performance metrics we derived from the infrastructure.

However, as the exploration environment is becoming more and more complicated, the energy of valid signals is weaker and the signal to noise (SNR) of seismic data is much lower which bring great difficulty to seismic data processing and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a new seismic random noise suppression approach based on the non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). Firstly, the noisy seismic data is decomposed into different sub-bands of frequency and orientation responses using NSCT.

We employ a similarity-based detection strategy, which takes trajectory length into consideration. Our approach can deal with both long and short trajectories by applying weighted similarity on trajectories and using trajectory concatenation or clipping.

Despite the importance of remixing as a foundation of collaborative and communal learning, the practice remains poorly understood, with the Scratch programming community remaining in the dark about which programming practices encourage and facilitate remixing. Scratch designers lack feedback on how the remixing facility is used in the wild. To gain a deeper insight into remixing, this paper investigates heretofore unexplored dimensions of remixing: (1) the prevailing modifications that remixes perform on existing projects, (2) the impact of the original project's code quality on the granularity, extent, and development time of the modifications in the remixes, and (3) the propensity of the dominant programming practices in the original project to remain so in the remixes.

However, neural machine translation has been less tested for English-Bangla language pair, two linguistically distant and widely spoken languages. In this paper, we apply neural machine translation to the task of English-Bangla translation in both directions and compare it against a standard phrase-based statistical machine translation system. We obtain up to +0.30 and +4.95 BLEU improvement over phrase-based statistical machine translation for English-to-Bangla and Bangla-to-English respectively. Due to low-resource and morphological richness of Bangla, English-Bangla translation task produces a large number of rare words. We apply subword segmentation with byte pair encoding to handle this rare words issue. We obtain up to +0.69 and +0.30 BLEU improvement over baseline neural machine translation for English-to-Bangla and Bangla-to-English respectively. We further investigate our system output for several challenging linguistic properties like subject-verb agreement, noun inflection, long distance reordering and rare words translation.

872,896,896,A scalable Galerkin multigrid method for real-time simulation of deformable objects,"We propose a simple yet efficient multigrid scheme to simulate high-resolution deformable objects in their full spaces at interactive frame rates. The point of departure of our method is the Galerkin projection which is simple to construct. However, a na√Øve Galerkin multigrid does not scale well for large and irregular grids because it trades-of matrix sparsity for smaller sized linear systems which eventually stops improving the performance. Given that observation, we design our special projection criterion which is based on skinning space coordinates with piecewise constant weights, to make our Galerkin multigrid method scale for high-resolution meshes without sufering from dense linear solves. The usage of skinning space coordinates enables us to reduce the resolution of grids more aggressively, and our piecewise constant weights further ensure us to always deal with reasonably-sparse linear solves. Our projection matrices also help us to manage multi-level linear systems efficiently. Therefore, our method can be applied to different optimization schemes such as Newton's method and Projective Dynamics, pushing the resolution of a real-time simulation to orders of magnitudes higher.

The clustering system is believed to be capable of optimizing the network so that there is no overlap in the operational area of the ship. The port clustering model will form port clusters that will be used in the integration model organization of the freight transportation on the Sea Tollway, Pelni and Pioneer ship network. The method used is a deterministic allocation model with R-tools. The results of the clustering implementation in the freight distribution system on Maluku Province shows that the implementation of the 3 clusters system increases the profit by 15.7% (compared to the current system which does not use clustering), whereas the income earned is actually lower with the 9 clusters system.

We examine how the ensuing dynamics of social commerce affect these visibility choices. We use data from a platform dedicated exclusively to facilitating the display of verified online and offline purchases with optional product commentaries. We use fixed effects and matching techniques to control for endogeneity in commentary and consumer disclosure, while embedding a new text-based model of product similarity into our econometric analysis and capturing product complementarity using network-based measures of similarity. Our findings demonstrate that disclosed purchase patterns are shaped by other users, even those with whom the discloser has no previously stated relationship. We find that the source of attention shapes disclosure behavior, and we uncover a relationship between comments and purchase similarity of disclosed purchases, suggesting that consumers play to the crowd. The negative relationship between product reviews and purchase disclosure suggest that consumers may disclose a purchase because of a relationship with that particular item and not a desire to habitually reveal purchases.

Even though most of the participants are assumed to be willing to participate in the sensing campaigns, some smartphone users may be reluctant to grant access to particular sensors in their devices. Besides this, the presence of adversaries in the participant pool makes the participant selection problem further challenging. With these in mind, we introduce Reputation and Comfort Level Aware Participant Selection (RACLAPS)which allows participants to modify their available set of sensors that can be accessed by central platform/task publisher i.e. participants can turn-off sensors according to their comfort. To demonstrate the effect of RA-CLAPS, we utilize Selective and Reputation-aware Recruitment (SRR) in which participants are selective in choosing their task to sense solely to improve income. To enrich the discussion, Non-Selective and Reputation-aware Recruitment (NSR) is also considered in which participants are given no choice regarding selectiveness, sensor configuration. Simulation results show that RA-CLAPS improves average user utility by 7.6% compared to its predecessor, SRR. We also mention that average discomfort per participant is reduced by 6.4% under RA-CLAPS when compared to non-selective and selective recruitment approaches.",60028897,"University of Ottawa, Canada",Ottawa,Canada,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",21.66666666666667,0.17847222222222225,0.4923611111111113,1,0.11618257261410789,0.07883817427385892,0.4009009009009009

By overlapping tracks, SMR enormously improves the storage area density, which in turn brings higher storage volumes. However, SMR sacrifices the random write performance for better storage volumes. Current SMR drives propose to remedy this problem by employing an in-drive persistent cache to temporally store incoming writes and migrate them to their disk destinations later on. Unfortunately, cleaning processes for the persistent cache takes up to tens of seconds, and the unpredictable timing of these time-consuming operations chokes normal requests and drastically degrades SMR drive performance. In this paper, we propose to remedy this issue by proactively freeing the persistent cache space so that keeping these lengthy processes transparent with regards to normal requests, therefore reducing the long tails and delivering steady and predictable performance for SMR drive-based storage systems. We prototype our design as a Host-Aware SMR drive aware userspace file system, AM FS, and evaluate it on the real HA-SMR drive with libzbc.

A LFA typically utilizes legitimate and low-rate flows, which makes it extremely hard to be detected and, subsequently, to be mitigated. In this paper, we present LF-Shield, that is a deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) based countermeasure to accurately detect and efficiently mitigate LFAs using software-defined network (SDN) paradigm. LF-Shield can identify malicious bots that launch LFA flows by extracting end-hosts' traffic features and afterwards, classifying the type of end-hosts based on deep ConvNet. Then, LF-Shield mitigates LFAs without affecting legitimate end-hosts through blocking the classified malicious bots and limiting the bandwidths of inactive or newly-accessed end-hosts. A LF-Shield prototype is implemented for evaluating its performance by several experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that LF-Shield can identify malicious bots with an accuracy of 96.4% and mitigate LFAs with the 93.1% reduction in link degradation ratio, with negligible impact on legitimate end-hosts.",60003970,Zhejiang University,Hangzhou,China,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",23.285714285714285,-0.0685897435897436,0.4262820512820514,1,0.14953271028037382,0.07009345794392523,0.39893617021276595

In Experiments 2 (slant estimation) and 3 (slant discrimination), we presented stimuli on a mirror stereoscope, which allowed us to more precisely control viewing and distortion parameters. Taken together, our results show that radial distortion has significant impact on perceived surface attitude, even following correction. Of the distortion levels we tested, 5% distortion results in significantly underestimated and less precise slant estimates relative to distortion-free surfaces.

Unfortunately, they also suffer from error-proneness, which sometimes results in costly consequences.

We hypothesize that a block-based formula editor could support spreadsheet users in a similar way. Therefore, we develop XLBlocks and conduct a think-aloud study with 13 experienced spreadsheet users from industry.

In our model, the data center can be powered by intermittent green energy like wind and solar, and the electricity with time-varying prices from the power grid. The energy from different sources can also choose to flow into long-term or short-term ESDs for later use. Note that, the former can sustain energy for a long time but with low charging/discharging rate, while the latter can charge/discharge very fast but with high energy leakage that can sustain energy only for a few hours. By combining them together, the energy cost can further be reduced. However, it is hard to decide when and how much energy from different sources should be used to power the data center directly or charged into different types of ESDs. We formulate our scheduling into a large-scale linear programming (LP) problem, which can be solved using CPLEX.

Toufar.This paper settles the computational complexity of model checking of several extensions of the monadic second order (MSO) logic on two classes of graphs: graphs of bounded treewidth and graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity. A classical theorem of Courcelle states that any graph property definable in MSO is decidable in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth. Algorithmic metatheorems like Courcelle‚Äôs serve to generalize known positive results on various graph classes. We explore and extend three previously studied MSO extensions: global and local cardinality constraints (CardMSO and MSO-LCC) and optimizing the fair objective function (fairMSO). First, we show how these extensions of MSO relate to each other in their expressive power. Furthermore, we highlight a certain ‚Äúlinearity‚Äù of some of the newly introduced extensions which turns out to play an important role. Second, we provide parameterized algorithms for the aforementioned structural parameters. On the side of neighborhood diversity, we show that combining the linear variants of local and global cardinality constraints is possible while keeping the linear (FPT) runtime but removing linearity of either makes this impossible assuming FPT ‚â† W[1]. Moreover, we provide a polynomial time (XP) algorithm for the most powerful of studied extensions, i.e. the combination of global and local constraints. Furthermore, we show a polynomial time (XP) algorithm on graphs of bounded treewidth for the same extension. In addition, we propose a general procedure for deriving XP algorithms on graphs on bounded treewidth using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). This shows an alternative approach to standard dynamic programming formulations.",60016605,Charles University,Prague Praha,Czech Republic,['1700'],16.25,0.08731962481962481,0.3412698412698412,0,0.11074918566775244,0.08469055374592833,0.4019607843137255

However, collecting and annotating large datasets can be a very cumbersome and expensive task. We tackle these problems with a virtual database approach where training data is generated using computer simulations of related phenomena. Specifically, we concentrate on the following problem: can cardiovascular indices such as aortic elasticity, diastolic and systolic blood pressures, and blood flow from heart be predicted continuously using wearable photoplethysmographic sensors? We simulate the blood flow using a haemodynamic model consisting of the entire human circulation. Repeated evaluation of the simulator allows us to create a database of ‚Äúvirtual subjects‚Äù with size that is only limited by available computational resources.

906,932,932,User Experience Evaluation in Virtual Reality based on Subjective Feelings and Physiological Signals,"At present, the research on emotion in the virtual environment is limited to the subjective materials, and there are very few studies based on objective physiological signals. In this article, the authors conducted a user experiment to study the user emotion experience of virtual reality (VR) by comparing subjective feelings and physiological data in VR and two-dimensional display (2D) environments. First, they analyzed the data of self-report questionnaires, including Self-assessment Manikin (SAM), Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). The result indicated that VR causes a higher level of arousal than 2D, and easily evokes positive emotions. Both 2D and VR environments are prone to eye fatigue, but VR is more likely to cause symptoms of dizziness and vertigo. Second, they compared the differences of electrocardiogram (ECG), skin temperature (SKT) and electrodermal activity (EDA) signals in two circumstances. Through mathematical analysis, all three signals had significant differences. Participants in the VR environment had a higher degree of excitement, and the mood fluctuations are more frequent and more intense. In addition, the authors used different machine learning models for emotion detection, and compared the accuracies on VR and 2D datasets. The accuracies of all algorithms in the VR environment are higher than that of 2D, which corroborated that the volunteers in the VR environment have more obvious skin electrical signals, and had a stronger sense of immersion.

In automatic traffic-sign maintenance and in a visual driver-assistance system, road-sign detection and recognition are two of the most important functions. Our system is able to detect and recognize circular, triangular signs and, hence, covers all existing GTRSB traffic-sign shapes. Road signs provide drivers important information and help them to drive more safely and more easily by guiding and warning them and thus regulating their actions. The proposed recognition system is based on the generalization properties of CNNs.

For some temporary and unexpected communication service requirements, it is uneconomical to deploy femtocell access points (FAPs) on the edge of cell. In this paper, we investigate a cellular system that utilizes a unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with base station module unit as an airborne mobile base station to provide communication channel for the cell-edge users offloaded by the MBS. Compared with FAPs, UAV is cheaper and flexible which can provide better communication quality for the cell-edge GTs with better channel condition. Based on the theoretical model, we proposed plausible optimal algorithm to maximize the energy-efficiency (EE) of the UAV by jointly optimizing the spectrum allocation, flying speed and user partition between the UAV and MBS.

Our eye model consists of the following functional components: (i) submodels of the 6 extraocular muscles that actuate realistic eye movements, (ii) an iris submodel, actuated by pupillary muscles, that accommodates to incoming light intensity, (iii) a corneal submodel and a deformable, ciliary-muscle-actuated lens submodel, which refract incoming light rays for focal accommodation, and (iv) a retina with a multitude of photoreceptors arranged in a biomimetic, foveated distribution. The light intensity captured by the photoreceptors is computed using ray tracing from the photoreceptor positions through the finite aperture pupil into the 3D virtual environment, and the visual information from the retina is output via an optic nerve vector. Our oculomotor control system includes a foveation controller implemented as a locally-connected, irregular Deep Neural Network (DNN), or ""LiNet"", that conforms to the nonuniform retinal photoreceptor distribution, and a neuromuscular motor controller implemented as a fully-connected DNN, plus auxiliary Shallow Neural Networks (SNNs) that control the accommodation of the pupil and lens. The DNNs are trained offline through deep learning from data synthesized by the eye model itself. Once trained, the oculomotor control system operates robustly and efficiently online. It innervates the intraocular muscles to perform illumination and focal accommodation and the extraocular muscles to produce natural eye movements in order to foveate and pursue moving visual targets.

In previous studies, some machine learning (ML)-based models were proposed to predict the traffic volume at a single road segment/position, and these models performed not bad. However, when applied in a more complicated road network, they show low efficiency or need to pay higher computing costs. To solve this problem, an innovative ML-based model named selected stacked gated recurrent units model (SSGRU), is proposed for predicting the traffic flow through a sparse road network in this paper. There are mainly two parts in this model, one is used to do spatial pattern mining based on linear regression coefficients, and the other one includes a stacked gated recurrent unit (SGRU) which is essential for multi-road traffic flow prediction. A binarytree is adopted to approximate the sparse road network in the suburban area. To evaluate the proposed model, seven different traffic volume data sets recorded at 15-min interval are chosen from the England Highways data set to test our proposed work.

Earlier works could just recognize paths or vehicles or pedestrians independently. However, the mix of path data, traffic, and pedestrian data can bolster a driver assistant framework. For the changing of lane assistance system (CLAS), it identifies the lanes which are in-front of the test vehicle and detect the vehicles around the test vehicle. Subsequently, in this investigation, a computer vision framework is used consisting three cameras, two of the cameras are on the right-view and left-view mirrors, the left-camera is being put on the windscreen of the test vehicle. The pictures from the cameras are utilized to identify three lanes and distinguish vehicles. For the lane recognition, line recognition algorithm is utilized. For vehicle location, we consolidate the horizontal border channel, the Otsu's thresholding, and the vertical border. The horizontal border channel and the Otsu's thresholding are utilized to distinguish vehicle prospects, at that point the vertical border is utilized to confirm the vehicle prospects. Kalman filter (linear quadratic estimation) is used to comply with the identified vehicle. For pedestrian-recognition, a straightforward, powerful edgelet features to improve the detection rate and classifier dependent on k-means grouping to lessen computational unpredictability is utilized. The proposed framework comprises of candidate characteristics of pedestrian-detection utilizing the edgelet features and uses the cascade structure of k-means clustering for empowering high identification precision at low false positives.

In these applications, similarity joins are the basic operation which further supports a wide range of similarity queries. However, this compute-intensive join operation calls for more efficient and effective algorithm to support real-Time queries. Exploiting general purpose GPUs (GPGPUs) is one natural solution. Nevertheless, existing join algorithms utilizing GPGPU lack considerations on unique features of spatial-Textual trajectories, especially the textual domain, thus resulting in poor performance. In this paper, we first propose a baseline spatial-Textual trajectory similarity join algorithm, which is essentially based on a traditional algorithm for relational joins on GPGPUs. Then, by analyzing the bottleneck of this baseline, we further develop a fine-grained join algorithm which consists of memory access techniques and optimizations. We propose a strategy of flip to ensure coalesced memory accesses, and a batch scheduler for dividing the whole task into batches to fit the global memory while alleviating imbalanced throughput.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme based on fragments storage and fragments recombination (FSFR) to solve the user's privacy leakage problem caused by timing attack in CCN. Firstly, the content in the network can be divided into different privacy levels according to the content provider, content consumer and router. Secondly, the optimal number of content fragments can be obtained by binary linear regression model based on content popularity, node betweenness and content privacy levels. Finally, the FSFR algorithm is proposed and applied to the private content for content distribution and achieving fine-grained privacy protection.

However, sketching requires significant expertise and time, making design sketches a scarce resource for the research community. We introduce OpenSketch, a dataset of product design sketches aimed at offering a rich source of information for a variety of computer-aided design tasks. OpenSketch contains more than 400 sketches representing 12 man-made objects drawn by 7 to 15 product designers of varying expertise. We provided participants with front, side and top views of these objects, and instructed them to draw from two novel perspective viewpoints. This drawing task forces designers to construct the shape from their mental vision rather than directly copy what they see. They achieve this task by employing a variety of sketching techniques and methods not observed in prior datasets. Together with industrial design teachers, we distilled a taxonomy of line types and used it to label each stroke of the 214 sketches drawn from one of the two viewpoints. While some of these lines have long been known in computer graphics, others remain to be reproduced algorithmically or exploited for shape inference. In addition, we also asked participants to produce clean presentation drawings from each of their sketches, resulting in aligned pairs of drawings of different styles.

928,955,955,Towards Chronic Liver Dysfunction Self-monitoring: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"The liver is our very own chemical processing plant as it plays a vital role in maintaining the body's metabolic balance. Liver's health is assessed by a group of clinical tests (such as blood tests, ultrasonographic imaging, liver biopsy) most of which are invasive and burdensome for the patients. In the setting of severely scarred liver, toxic substances, such as ammonia, have fewer opportunities to be detoxified. Accumulation of ammonia in the systemic circulation and in the brain may result in Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE), a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities which entails changes in consciousness, intellectual functions, behavior. Minimal HE has attracted increasing attention, as it does not cause detectable changes in personality or behaviour, but the complex and sustained attention is impaired. Hence, it can be detected only by specific but biased, time-consuming and burdensome examinations, such as blood ammonia levels assessment and neuro-psychological tests. The obstrusivity of the majority of the liver function clinical tests, and, in case of minimal HE, the lack of reliable examinations, are encouraging the scientific community to look for alternative diagnostic methods. For this purpose, the exploitation of a non-invasive technique such as breath analysis, to identify chronic liver disease, discriminate among its degree of severity and detect the onset of HE, could be a step forward for clinical diagnosis. In this paper, we report a proof-of-concept study that aimed at detecting ammonia in the breath of patients suffering from chronic liver disease by means of a low-cost, easy-to-use, gas-sensors based device. Not only, we also aimed at investigating the possibility of discriminating the several severity degree of liver impairment on the basis of the detected ammonia.",60085207,Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione A.

This large amount of devices can be used to improve people's interaction with their environment. However, this also implies an increase in the complexity when interacting with so many heterogeneous devices. Automating this process is key to keep up with this growth. This is the purpose of the People as a Service model (PeaaS), which works towards developing virtual profiles for every user in their own mobile devices under their full control. These profiles allow to establish preferences and predefined parameters, which are then used by the devices they connect to. By integrating both the information in the users' virtual profiles and the information given by the devices they connect to, we can create a context in which to make smart decisions and apply them to the devices, all of this in a decentralised way. This allows for a programmatically configuration of the devices without the need of the user's intervention.

Inspired by the success of deep learning approach to standard Bayer demosaicing, we aim to investigate how artifacts-prone Quad Bayer array can benefit from it. We found that deeper networks are capable to improve image quality and reduce artifacts; however, deeper networks can be hardly deployed on mobile devices given very high image resolutions: 24MP, 36MP, 48MP. In this article, we propose an efficient end-to-end solution to bridge this gap‚Äîa duplex pyramid network (DPN). Deep hierarchical structure, residual learning, and linear feature map depth growth allow very large receptive field, yielding better details restoration and artifacts reduction, while staying computationally efficient. Experiments show that the proposed network outperforms state of the art for standard and Quad Bayer demosaicing. For the challenging Quad Bayer CFA, the proposed method reduces visual artifacts better than state-of-the-art deep networks including artifacts existing in conventional commercial solutions.

Traditionally, the user applications are mapped onto a regular network with nearby compute nodes to reduce the network distances. However, it is likely that the rigid mapping limitation on regular topologies may largely delay the dispatch time when the workload is heavy at a short period. In this work, we target the applications with unknown communication patterns over random interconnection networks, which have drawn increasing attention in the HPC world due to their low diameter and low average shortest path length (ASPL). We propose to use topology embedding metrics, i.e., diameter and ASPL, for application mapping to overcome the rigid limitation on regular topologies. We investigate the time-space tradeoff among several application mapping algorithms using a compound application workload. Evaluation results show that, when compared to the baseline random connected topology mapping, the proposed diameter/ASPL-based topology mapping algorithms reduce up to 48.0% makespan and up to 78.1% average turnaround time and improve up to 1.9X system utilization when the instantaneous workload is heavy over random interconnection networks.",60028928,Research Organization of Information and Systems National Institute of Informatics,Tokyo,Japan,['1708'],27.0,-0.07352607709750568,0.4087781266352694,1,0.0958904109589041,0.0273972602739726,0.35545023696682465

In the distributed computing scenarios, data locality (scheduling tasks on where the data resides) is essential to the performance since higher data locality brings lower network transmission cost and higher throughput. However, we find that the native YARN scheduling mechanism has little data locality and the delay scheduling strategy leads to the long-Tail effect while achieving data locality for in-memory computing scenarios. Therefore, in this paper we propose the push-based YARN scheduling mechanism for the in-memory computing environment. First, we classify the ResourceRequests into various categories. Then, we prune the non-local ResourceRequests to achieve fast datalocality in-memory computation. Finally, we push the left longtail ResourceRequests to the data-locality nodes to avoid the long-Tail effect. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling mechanism achieves nearly 100% datalocality percentage comparing to the native YARN scheduling mechanism that only achieves 10%20% data-locality percentage. Under the identical data-locality percentage, the proposed pushbased scheduling mechanism promotes nearly 20% throughput and reduces nearly 10% application running time comparing to the existing delay scheduling mechanism used in YARN.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,['1708'],22.555555555555557,0.03967391304347827,0.3753623188405797,1,0.11952191235059761,0.035856573705179286,0.4329004329004329

As happened in Papua, some local languages have become extinct and some are threatened of extinction. Some local languages that are under threat of extinction are found in the Pegunungan Bintang regency, namely the languages of the Ngalum, Ketengban, Murop, Lepki and Arimtap tribes. Speakers of the local languages of these tribes are increasingly diminishing due to social, political and economic globalization. While on the other hand globalization brings opportunities for us to develop and preserve local languages by utilizing the sophistication and availability of information technology.

In this way, CRs can sense the spectrum environment to select the best available channel for communication and they can, potentially, use licensed spectrum bands as a Secondary User (SU). However, CR has to vacate the licensed spectrum band as soon as a Primary User (PU) intends to use the channel. In this way, one of the most challenging topics in CR is the PU arrival prediction. Therefore, this paper presents a real-data study case of PUs arrivals prediction using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in CR. Herein, the Energy Detector (ED) is used to detect the presence of PUs.

However, in many universities this repetitive works was still carried out manually. It is because there are so many constraints that must be considered either from the students and lecturers' requirement or the infrastructure such as room availability. Therefore, to automate the process of timetabling is hard problem. Scientifically, in the literature, course timetabling optimization is one of non-deterministic polynomial problems, usually abbreviated as NP-hard problem. For NP-hard problem, there is not any exact algorithm known could solve the problem within polynomial-time. The state-of-the-art methods for solving the problem are approximation algorithms that are mainly meta-heuristics. This paper presents a new approach, namely, hyper-heuristics as opposed to meta-heuristics, to cope with the need of intensive problem specific parameter tuning in meta-heuristics approach. The algorithms employed within hyper-heuristic approach presented in this paper are tabu search hybridize with variable neighborhood search. Tested over two real-world course timetabling problem datasets, the computational results from the experiments showed that the proposed algorithm could automate the process of timetabling. Furthermore, compared to the timetable produced manually, in term of soft constraint violation penalties, the proposed algorithm could improve by 1855 and 1110 respectively.

947,974,974,Taichi: A language for high-performance computation on spatially sparse data structures,"3D visual computing data are often spatially sparse. To exploit such sparsity, people have developed hierarchical sparse data structures, such as multilevel sparse voxel grids, particles, and 3D hash tables. However, developing and using these high-performance sparse data structures is challenging, due to their intrinsic complexity and overhead. We propose Taichi, a new data-oriented programming language for efficiently authoring, accessing, and maintaining such data structures. The language offers a high-level, data structure-agnostic interface for writing computation code. The user independently specifies the data structure. We provide several elementary components with different sparsity properties that can be arbitrarily composed to create a wide range of multi-level sparse data structures. This decoupling of data structures from computation makes it easy to experiment with different data structures without changing computation code, and allows users to write computation as if they are working with a dense array. Our compiler then uses the semantics of the data structure and index analysis to automatically optimize for locality, remove redundant operations for coherent accesses, maintain sparsity and memory allocations, and generate efficient parallel and vectorized instructions for CPUs and GPUs. Our approach yields competitive performance on common computational kernels such as stencil applications, neighbor lookups, and particle scattering. We demonstrate our language by implementing simulation, rendering, and vision tasks including a material point method simulation, finite element analysis, a multigrid Poisson solver for pressure projection, volumetric path tracing, and 3D convolution on sparse grids. Our computation-data structure decoupling allows us to quickly experiment with different data arrangements, and to develop high-performance data structures tailored for specific computational tasks.

Trajectory clustering technique identifies the similar trajectories (or trajectory segments) and classifies them into the several clusters which can reveal the potential movement behaviors of nodes. At present, most of the existing trajectory clustering methods focus on some spatial properties of trajectories (such as geographic locations, movement directions), while the spatial-Temporal properties (especially the combination of spatial distances and semantic distances) are ignored, and thus some vital information regarding the movement behaviors of nodes is probably lost in the trajectory clustering results. In this paper, we propose a Joint Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Clustering Method (JSTTCM), where some spatialtemporal properties of the trajectories are exploited to cluster the trajectory segments.

961,989,989,Animating landscape: Self-supervised learning of decoupled motion and appearance for single-image video synthesis,"Automatic generation of a high-quality video from a single image remains a challenging task despite the recent advances in deep generative models. Tis paper proposes a method that can create a high-resolution, long-term animation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from a single landscape image where we mainly focus on skies and waters. Our key observation is that the motion (e.g., moving clouds) and appearance (e.g., time-varying colors in the sky) in natural scenes have different time scales. We thus learn them separately and predict them with decoupled control while handling future uncertainty in both predictions by introducing latent codes. Unlike previous methods that infer output frames directly, our CNNs predict spatially-smooth intermediate data, i.e., for motion, flow fields for warping, and for appearance, color transfer maps, via self-supervised learning, i.e., without explicitly-provided ground truth. Tese intermediate data are applied not to each previous output frame, but to the input image only once for each output frame. Tis design is crucial to alleviate error accumulation in long-term predictions, which is the essential problem in previous recurrent approaches. The output frames can be looped like cinemagraph, and also be controlled directly by specifying latent codes or indirectly via visual annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comparisons with the state-of-the-arts on video prediction as well as appearance manipulation.

In the proposed method, the concept of Riemann mean distance of temporal covariance matrix is introduced to quantify the clutter nonstationarity, and in this way we realize adaptive segmentation of the clutter range-Doppler spectrum. Then the different clutter suppression methods including pulse Doppler (PD) processing, two-dimensional space-time adaptive processing (2D STAP), and three-dimensional STAP (3D STAP) are used to suppress clutter in different regions.

Because of the node trust in some consortium blockchain and private blockchain, a no byzantine fault tolerance algorithm KRaft(Kademlia-Raft) algorithm with high throughput and high scalability is proposed. KRaft consensus algorithm is a Raft-like consensus algorithm that preserves the logic of part of Raft consensus algorithm. It optimized leader election and consensus process of the Raft consensus algorithm through the established K-Bucket node relationships in the Kademlia protocol, improved leader election speed and throughput. Firstly, the KRaft algorithm uses the K-bucket established by Kademlia protocol to achieve stable and efficient leader election process for the candidate node split vote problem and the low voting efficiency caused by the increase of the Follower node in the Raft algorithm. Secondly, aiming at the low efficiency and load imbalance of the leader single-node log replication in the Raft algorithm consensus process, a parallel log replication scheme with multiple candidate nodes for balancing the leader node load is proposed to improve the throughput and the scalability of the algorithm.

A mini cluster of SBCs is used to develop a scalable and resilient energy monitoring application.

Poisoning attacks are widely investigated in centralized learning paradigm, however distributed poisoning attacks, in which more than one attacker colludes with each other, and injects malicious training samples into local models of their own, may result in a greater catastrophe in federated learning intuitively. In this paper, through real implementation of a federated learning system and distributed poisoning attacks, we obtain several observations about the relations between the number of poisoned training samples, attackers, and attack success rate. Moreover, we propose a scheme, Sniper, to eliminate poisoned local models from malicious participants during training. Sniper identifies benign local models by solving a maximum clique problem, and suspected (poisoned) local models will be ignored during global model updating. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of Sniper.

Although most existing studies focus on the performance of DNNs pre-deployed at remote clouds, the network delay caused by computation offloading from network cameras to remote clouds is usually long and sometimes unbearable. Edge computing can enable rich services and applications in close proximity to the network cameras. However, owing to the limited computing resources of distributed edge clouds, it is challenging to satisfy low latency and high accuracy requirements for all users, especially when the number of users surges. To address this challenge, we first formulate the intelligent video surveillance task scheduling problem that minimizes the average response time while meeting the performance requirements of tasks and prove that it is NP-hard. Second, we present an adaptive DNN model selection method to identify the most effective DNN model for each task by comparing the feature similarity between the input video segment and pre-stored training videos.

One important mission is to further reduce the monetary cost of fog resources while meeting the ever-growing demand of multiple users. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the total cost for multiple mobile users to provide an efficient resource provisioning scheme in fog computing. The total cost includes two aspects: The replication cost and the transmission cost. We consider two cases for the resource provision problem by focusing on different cost models. First, one simple case where users can only upload one replication is discussed, and an optimal solution is proposed by converting the original problem into one of bipartite graph matching. Then we consider a more complicated case that each user can upload multiple replications on fog nodes in the resource provisioning. For different transmission cost models, the transmission cost is related to the distance of each pair of fog nodes. This problem is proven to be NP-hard. We first propose a non-Adaptive algorithm which is proved to be bounded by 2/3W+1/3OPT. Another 3+œµ-Approximation algorithm is proposed based on local search, which has better performance with higher complexity.

However, these methods cannot be applied directly on the offline handwritten flowcharts which are lack of the stroke information. Hence it is in a great demand to design an effective algorithm to recognize the offline handwritten flowcharts. Inspired by Region Proposal Network in deep learning, a framework is proposed to detect different symbols in offline handwritten flowcharts. With the predicted localization, a pixel searching algorithm is presented to refine the results of symbols. Finally, all the symbols in flowcharts are connected, which turns offline flowcharts into images and structural XML. Experiments are conducted on several datasets.

In this work, we depart from such existing approximations and solve the phase retrieval problem for a hologram of a scene at a single depth at a given time by revisiting complex Wirtinger derivatives. We also discuss extending our framework to render 3D volumetric scenes. Using Wirtinger derivatives allows us to pose the phase retrieval problem as a quadratic problem which can be minimized with first-order optimization methods.

981,1010,1010,SEAD: Towards a social-media-driven energy-Aware drone sensing framework,"Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become an important tool for efficient disaster response. Despite the virtues of UAVs in disaster response applications, various limitations (e.g., requiring manual input, finite battery life) hinder their mass adoption. In contrast, social sensing is emerging as a new sensing paradigm that utilizes signals provided by 'human sensors' to gather awareness of the events occurring in the physical world. Despite being inherently broader in scope, a shortcoming of social sensing is the reliability of the sensing data that are contributed by humans. In this paper, we introduce the concept of jointly exploiting the reliability of drones and the scope of social sensing to efficiently uncover the truthful events during disasters. However, such a tight integration of social and physical sensing introduces several technical challenges. The first challenge is satisfying the conflicting objectives of event coverage of the application and energy conservation of drones. The second challenge is adapting to the dynamics of the physical world and social media. In this paper, we present a Social-media-driven Energy-Aware Drone (SEAD) sensing framework to address the above challenges. In particular, we develop a reinforcement learning-based drone dispatching scheme that adapts to the physical and social environments and launches an appropriate proportion of drones for event exploration. We further utilize a bottom-up game-Theoretic task allocation approach to guide drones effectively to the event locations.

982,1011,1011,IVP: A Three Level Confusion-Diffusion Network Supporting Implicit Data Integrity,"We present a cryptographic construction called IVP and study its security properties. IVP is a three level confusion-diffusion network that supports confidentiality and data integrity without requiring any message expansion of the content, such as, for example, for the computation of a MAC. We demonstrate that IVP is in the recently proposed class of cryptographic constructions called 'Random Oracles according to Observer functions' (RO2). These constructions support a new notion of data integrity called 'implicit' data integrity, which is based on the fact that user data usually demonstrate some patterns. If some ciphertext becomes corrupted, then the resulting plaintext no longer demonstrates such patterns. Thus, defense against data corruption attacks becomes possible by hardening the computation of ciphertext values, the plaintext of which demonstrates patterns. The encryption key is considered unknown.We show that IVP supports implicit data integrity and is secure in input perturbing and oracle replacing adversary models. The security of IVP is associated with a pattern which is frequently encountered among client and server data. This is the pattern of encountering 4 or more 16-bit words being equal to each other in a set of 32 words. The cryptographic strength of IVP is 30.215 bits, which is sufficient for defending against on-line data corruption and content replay attacks. Computationally, IVP is much lighter than other authenticated encryption approaches requiring only two additional rounds of AES, beyond the AES standard encryption rounds in the critical path.

CPTED components are also utilized for preventing traffic accidents and ensuring pedestrian safety. It is important to take measures to design an environment that does not seem threatening, for example by installing CCTVs in the same color of the building they are being installed on and at an interval of 5 meters at a placement that does not interfere with pedestrians‚Äô walking. In addition to the images taken by unmanned drones, the taken from these CCTVs will be used as well as they are also important for crime prevention.This high-tech security system will allow users to monitor areas vulnerable to crime in real time and strengthen policing activities. Also, it will predict areas at risk of crime and allow users to devise strategies for crime prevention utilizing the Map Data that is constantly collected. Supplementing patrol personnel with unmanned drones will create a more efficient human resources management system as well as minimize blind spots in monitoring by building a tighter security infrastructure. The technology is currently still in its early stages, but if unmanned drones are equipped with effective crime-recognition technology, such a high-tech security system continuously monitoring crime-prone areas in real time, it is likely the system could be established as an effective means of crime prevention in the future. With the technology presented in this paper, it is possible to analyze image patterns under limited conditions to establish a real-time crime prevention environment and to examine an integrated control system that can detect situations that have previously been categorized as a risk. In addition, it is possible to recognize crime as it occurs by analyzing people‚Äôs behavioral patterns inside the patrol route of the unmanned drones.It will be possible to prevent crimes to the greatest extent by utilizing various forms of crime prevention facilities such as unmanned drones.

987,1016,1016,Reducing recommender system biases: An investigation of rating display designs," All rights reserved.Prior research has shown that online recommendations have a significant influence on consumers' preference ratings and economic behavior. Specifically, biases induced by observing personalized system recommendations can lead to distortions in users' self-reported preference ratings after consumption of an item, thus contaminating the users' subsequent inputs to the recommender system. This, in turn, provides the system with an inaccurate view of user preferences and opens up possibilities of rating manipulation. As recommender systems continue to become increasingly popular in today's online environments, preventing or reducing such system-induced biases constitutes a highly important and practical research problem. In this paper, we address this problem via the analysis of different rating display designs for the purpose of proactively preventing biases before they occur (i.e., at rating collection time). We use randomized laboratory experimentation to test how the presentation format of personalized recommendations affects the biases generated in post-consumption preference ratings. We demonstrate that graphical rating display designs of recommender systems are more advantageous than numerical designs in reducing the biases, although none are able to remove biases completely. We also show that scale compatibility is a contributing mechanism operating to create these biases, although not the only one.

989,1018,1018,Reinforcement Learning Based Scheduling Algorithm for Optimizing Age of Information in Ultra Reliable Low Latency Networks,"Age of Information (AoI) measures the freshness of the information at a remote location. AoI reflects the time that is elapsed since the generation of the packet by a transmitter. In this paper, we consider a remote monitoring problem (e.g., remote factory) in which a number of sensor nodes are transmitting time sensitive measurements to a remote monitoring site. We consider minimizing a metric that maintains a trade-off between minimizing the sum of the expected AoI of all sensors and minimizing an Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) term. The URLLC term is considered to ensure that the probability the AoI of each sensor exceeds a predefined threshold is minimized. Moreover, we assume that sensors tolerate different threshold values and generate packets at different sizes. Motivated by the success of machine learning in solving large networking problems at low complexity, we develop a low complexity reinforcement learning based algorithm to solve the proposed formulation. We trained our algorithm using the state-of-the-art actor-critic algorithm over a set of public bandwidth traces. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the considered baselines in terms of minimizing the expected AoI and the threshold violation of each sensor.",60012954,Oulun Yliopisto,Oulu,Finland,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",21.66666666666667,0.000952380952380949,0.33968253968253964,1,0.15178571428571427,0.049107142857142856,0.3598130841121495

991,1020,1020,Analyzing resource distribution over a real-world large-scale virtual content infrastructure,"Communication service providers (CSPs) face competitive pressure to increase infrastructure utilization and reduce operational costs while at the same time maximize bandwidth and maintain quality of service for end users. Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) are widely used to achieve these goals by optimally distributing content to cache servers at the edge, access and core networks. More recently, virtualization and cloud computing are being used to deploy and utilize virtual Content Delivery Networks (vCDNs) to reduce costs and increase elasticity while avoiding performance, quality, reliability and availability limitations that characterize traditional CDNs. In order to study the effectiveness of virtual cache placements and optimal distribution over a real-world large-scale vCDN infrastructure, we model and simulate BT's network using a novel parallel simulation framework. Results show that virtual cache placement impacts on the number of accepted requests, resource consumption (compute and network), and end-user network latency.

The contribution of this article lies in the fact that the authors successfully use the neighborhood grouping technology to rapidly find the optimal prediction mode for the current CU, which can significantly reduce computation complexity for HEVC. Specifically, they use the correlative information of adjacent angle prediction mode in their first scheme to quickly reduce the number of Rough Mode Decision (RMD); then they use the correlation between Most Probable Mode (MPM) and the first candidate mode selected as the optimal prediction mode to quickly determine the number of candidate modes; at last, they quickly find the optimal prediction mode with the minimum Rate Distortion Cost (RDCost) by using neighborhood grouping technology or direct calculation approach based on the number of candidate modes. As a result, their proposed algorithm can efficiently solve the problem above. The simulation results show that our proposed intra mode prediction decision algorithm based on neighborhood grouping in this article can reduce about 22.3% computational complexity on average only at a cost of 0.03% bit rate increase and 0.26% PSNR decline compared with the standard reference HM16.1 algorithm.",60032203,South China Agricultural University,Guangzhou,China,['1706'],41.2,0.18676470588235292,0.4622549019607843,0,0.1277533039647577,0.07488986784140969,0.24336283185840707

998,1027,1027,Holographic near-eye displays based on overlap-add stereograms,"Holographic near-eye displays are a key enabling technology for virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) applications. Holographic stereograms (HS) are a method of encoding a light field into a hologram, which enables them to natively support view-dependent lighting effects. However, existing HS algorithms require the choice of a hogel size, forcing a tradeoff between spatial and angular resolution. Based on the fact that the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) connects a hologram to its observable light field, we develop the overlap-add stereogram (OLAS) as the correct method of ""inverting"" the light field into a hologram via the STFT. The OLAS makes more efficient use of the information contained within the light field than previous HS algorithms, exhibiting better image quality at a range of distances and hogel sizes. Most remarkably, the OLAS does not degrade spatial resolution with increasing hogel size, overcoming the spatio-angular resolution tradeoff that previous HS algorithms face. Importantly, the optimal hogel size of previous methods typically varies with the depth of every object in a scene, making the OLAS not only a hogel size-invariant method, but also nearly scene independent. We demonstrate the performance of the OLAS both in simulation and on a prototype near-eye display system, showing focusing capabilities and view-dependent effects.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,['1704'],25.625,0.2166666666666667,0.5632352941176472,1,0.10317460317460317,0.05555555555555555,0.37606837606837606

The key idea is to deform the source image according to the geometry features and generate a high-resolution image with the desired attribute. To address the problem of the unpaired training samples, the CycleGAN architecture is applied to form an attribute adding and removing cycle, where the bilateral mappings between the source and target domains are learned. The geometry flow and occlusion mask are learned by the warping sub-network to capture the geometric variation between the two domains. In the attribute adding process, the spatial transformer network (STN) warps the source face into the desired pose and shape according to the flow, and the transfer sub-network hallucinates new components on the warped image. In the attribute removing process, the recover sub-network and the STN reverts the sample back to the source domain.

However, Over-The-Top (OTT) video is the one significantly increasing its strength, causing infrastructural and business challenges to Telecommunication Operators (Telcos), which provide traditional video services. Telcos must improve their network infrastructure to sustain future demand for OTT video content while improving user perceived Quality-of-Experience (QoE). A meaningful way to accomplish that is to distribute hardware appliances compatible with the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm throughout the network, improving flexibility and capacity while introducing new ways of content delivery.Towards this objective, this paper proposes an SDN load balancing approach to distribute OTT video requests through multiple servers.

Practitioners often have difficulties in conducting costly and time-consuming human-in-the-loop studies, so an analytical strategy that helps them determine whether their designs are capturing their planned intent is needed. A traditional top-down, hypothesis-driven experiment that examined whether external displays mounted on autonomous cars could effectively communicate with pedestrians led to the conclusion that the displays had no effect on safety. However, by first taking a bottom-up, data-driven machine learning approach, those segments of the population that were most affected by the external displays were identified. Then, a hypothesis-driven, within-subjects analysis of variance revealed that an external display mounted on an autonomous car that provided the vehicle's speed as opposed to commanding a go/no-go decision provided an additional 4 feet of safety for early adopters. One caveat to this approach is that the selection of a specific algorithm can significantly influence the results and more work is needed to determine the sensitivity of this approach with seemingly similar machine learning classification approaches.",60021918,University of Virginia,Charlottesville,United States,['1702'],34.0,0.2434210526315789,0.462280701754386,0,0.14979757085020243,0.0,0.2818181818181818

Accordingly, we allow dynamic use of multiple network interfaces taking into consideration their energy requirement and price models to deliver premium services and minimize the overall energy consumption and total cost. We develop a novel and efficient real-time traffic splitting approach that makes use of predicted bit rate of each network interface in addition to device-to-device cooperation to decide on the amount of video traffic to be delivered on each interface at every time slot.

Since the general double scattering in model-based decomposition does not support their dominant scattering mechanism, it's still a challenge for modeling the scattering mechanism of oriented buildings. In this paper, the HV induced by oriented buildings is modeled by a rotated dihedral corner reflector. The cross scattering matrix of oriented building is obtained by averaging a cosine squared distribution with its peak at the dominant polarimetric orientation angle (DPOA) of an area and an adaptive width. The relation between DPOA and distribution width is acquired. Then an optimization strategy which eliminates the negative power and balances time and efficiency is proposed to estimate the scattering contributions.

Several approached have been identified by literature to mitigate the challenges of alternatives ranking, however, these approaches overlooked the importance of value management principles in modeling. Value management emphasizes on two main criteria to make a value decision which are Cost verses Functions. In this paper, Value Management-based Alternatives Ranking Approach that includes cost and function criteria in the modelling. Two main approaches are proposed by literature to optimize the ranking which are interest-based ranking and weight-based ranking. However, the two approaches produce totally two different results for a particular problem. Alternative interest-based ranking is recommended by value-management; but it creates a huge conflict among members. While, Alternative ranking based-weight is straight-forward with low or no conflict, but it is influenced by power, such influencing reduces reliability of a decision. To tackle this problem, we combine the processes of the two approaches alternative interest-based ranking and weight to make value decision and at the same time reduce the conflict among members. A scenario from construction domain is selected to test the proposed approach in ranking the alternatives based on cost and function criteria.

This improved survival rate comes with an increased risk for delayed neurocognitive effects in attention, working memory, and processing speed. Predictive modeling and characterization of neurocognitive effects are critical to inform the family and also to identify patients for interventions targeting. Current state-of-the-art methods mainly use hypothesis-driven statistical testing methods to characterize and model such cognitive events. While these techniques have proven to be useful in understanding cognitive abilities, they are inadequate in explaining causal relationships, as well as individuality and variations. In this study, we developed multivariate data-driven models to measure the late neurocognitive effects of ALL patients using behavioral phenotypes, Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DTI) based tractography data, morphometry statistics, tractography measures, behavioral, and demographic variables.

Adaptive mechanisms, such as channel adaptation and channel hopping, can be applied to deal with the temporal and spatial variations in link quality that can appear in an IWSN. The first step to effectively use such mechanisms is to estimate the quality of the links in the network, which can provide useful information for the adaptive mechanisms, in order to improve important metrics, such as the packet reception rate, and energy consumption. In this context, this paper evaluates experimentally a link quality estimator, which uses dedicated nodes to estimate the link quality in real-time, without imposing a high overhead. A long-term experiment was performed in a fuel loading plant and the results showed that the estimator is accurate and reactive for the scenario considered in the paper. From the results obtained in the experiment, it was also possible to observe the quality of the 16 channels defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz band, for different nodes, and discuss how the adaptive mechanisms could be used to increase the network quality of service, by picking the appropriate channels for each link during the network operation.",60011324,Universidade Federal da Paraiba,Joao Pessoa,Brazil,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",33.0,0.19357142857142856,0.5219047619047619,1,0.1210762331838565,0.04484304932735426,0.2557077625570776

In the last decade, numerous FCP models are developed by utilizing the past financial data of a company. As the financial data is high-dimensional and holds many unnecessary features which can influence the overall classification accuracy. To avoid this problem, feature selection methods are used earlier to the data classification process. This paper develops an FCP model which employs genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection in prior to classification process. The inclusion of GA-FS method eliminates the irrelevant features and helps to enhance the accuracy of the FCP model. The proposed FCP model is tested on two benchmark dataset namely qualitative bankruptcy dataset in addition to Australian Credit dataset. For comparison purposes, GA, CFS and CSF based feature selection methodologies are used.

Different from the traditional stator-PM machines, the excitation flux is transferred between the complementary rotors, hence switched smoothly without been shorted or opened in the air gaps. As a result, the PM utilization in the proposed machine can be doubled compared to that in traditional stator PM machine. In addition, the proposed machine also contributes to reduced cogging torque, higher winding utilization factor and neglectable mutual inductance, which helps to improve its torque performance as well as fault-tolerant capability.

1030,1059,1059,Development of system dynamics model to increase salt fulfillment ratio,"Salt demands in Indonesia have continued to increase over the past decade, while salt production fluctuates and still depends on weather conditions. This makes salt imports tend to increase and salt self-sufficiency is difficult to achieve. Indonesia needs serious efforts to achieve self-sufficiency, both consumption salt and industrial salt. In this study we identify problems that exist in the salt industry and determine the factors that have a significant effect on the system. The national salt production system is represented in a dynamic model using the System Dynamic. We use System Dynamic based on the consideration that this framework offers the ability to combine expert knowledge in the model and the ability to model non-linear behavior that has a significant contribution to the national salt production. System dynamic modeling is also able to associate between variables in a closed causal loop so that actions taken by changing one variable will have an impact on the initial conditions. From the base model simulation results, we developed several scenarios to increase salt fulfillment ratio. To support the sustainability of the salt business, we make a price scenario that supports salt business remains profitable for farmers.

1031,1060,1060,Trace clustering exploration for detecting sudden drift: A case study in logistic process,"Handling concept drift in process mining is one of the challenges tasks to construct the process model. Process model discovery, as the crucial perspective of process mining, should consider concept drift to discover the changes of a business process over time from execution trace. Many previous works have been dedicated to detect the drift using approaches from process discovery. As a matter of fact, there are many statistical parameters involving in the existing approaches that could be a barrier to construct the representative model. Unsupervised learning (i.e., trace clustering in process mining) could be the option to understand the changes of a process through learning the sequential patterns. However, there was a limited study on using trace clustering to detect the concept drift. This study attempts to explore the use of trace clustering techniques (i.e., profiles) to deal with change process discovery as the one of categorization of concept drift in process mining. The results of various trace clustering approaches were compared to the ground truth determined by both domain experts and existing concept drift approach. To verify the results, a dataset from logistics process was used.

1032,1061,1061,Stable method for solving the Cauchy problem with the use of Chebyshev polynomials,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the method for solving the inverse Cauchy-type problem for the Laplace‚Äôs equation. Calculations were made for the rectangular domain with the target temperature on three boundaries and, additionally, on one of the boundaries, the heat flux distribution was selected. The purpose of consideration was to determine the distribution of temperature on a section of the boundary of the investigated domain (boundary Œì1) and find proper method for the problem regularization. Design/methodology/approach: The solution of the direct and the inverse (Cauchy-type) problems for the Laplace‚Äôs equation is presented in the paper. The form of the solution is noted as the linear combination of the Chebyshev polynomials. The collocation method in which collocation points had been determined based on the Chebyshev nodes was applied. To solve the Cauchy problem, the minimum of functional describing differences between the target and the calculated values of temperature and the heat flux on a section of the domain‚Äôs boundary was sought. Various types of the inverse problem regularization, based on Tikhonov and Tikhonov‚ÄìPhilips regularizations, were analysed. Regularization parameter Œ± was chosen with the use of the Morozov discrepancy principle. Findings: Calculations were performed for random disturbances to the heat flux density of up to 0.01, 0.02 and 0.05 of the target value. The quality of obtained results was next estimated by means of the norm. Effect of the disturbance to the heat flux density and the type of regularization on the sought temperature distribution on the boundary Œì1 was investigated. Presented methods of regularization are considerably less sensitive to disturbances to measurement data than to Tikhonov regularization. Practical implications: Discussed in this paper is an example of solution of the Cauchy problem for the Laplace‚Äôs equation in the rectangular domain that can be applied for determination of the temperature distribution on the boundary of the heated element where it is impossible to measure temperature or the measurement is subject to a great error, for instance on the inner wall of the boiler. Authors investigated numerical examples for functions with singularities outside the domain, for which values of gradients change significantly within the calculation domain what corresponds to significant changes in temperature on the wall of the boiler during the fuel combustion. Originality/value: In this paper, a new method for solving the Cauchy problem for the Laplace‚Äôs equation is described. To solve this problem, the Chebyshev polynomials and nodes were used. Various types of regularization of this problem were considered.",60008555,Politechnika Poznanska,Poznan,Poland,['1706'],22.88888888888889,0.022727272727272728,0.4394830659536542,1,0.07494646680942184,0.03854389721627409,0.26304347826086955

With the increasing data volume, the centralized server, especially its computation capability and memory space, cannot afford the computing of fuzzy rough set. To enable the fuzzy rough set for big data analysis, in this paper, we propose the novel Distributed Fuzzy Rough Set (DFRS) based feature selection in cloud computing, which separates and assigns the tasks to multiple nodes for parallel computing. The key challenge is to maintain the global information on each distributed node without conserving the entire fuzzy relation matrix.

The exposed contextual information can be utilized by the adversary to deliver attack or derive the sensitive information such as location of the sink nodes, source node and monitored objects. In sensor network the base station (BS) acts as a gateway between the sensor nodes and the control unit. By known information of the physical location of the BS the attacker can alter or destroy the BS intern results that cause the failure of the entire sensor network. There is a need for routing algorithm which can effectively camouflage the location of the BS. In this paper a hybrid algorithm that provides location privacy of the BS has been proposed.

Although previous researches have discussed the readiness assessment from student perspectives, and technology adoption factors to improve continuous use of SHARE ITS, only small number of courses are active among hundred courses registered in SHARE ITS, based on the statistics provided by ITS Academic Director in 2017. The lack of participation from lecturers to deliver blended learning-based courses, and the absence of policy and resources to support the participation, is seen as the main drivers of the lagging implementation of SHARE ITS. In the light of understanding these issues, the study aimed at analyzing the factors that influence the users' resistance toward SHARE ITS implementation. The perspective of lecturers was taken into consideration based on a conceptual model developed by Lin et al. The model introduced resistance factors, including perceived threat, perceived usefulness, perceived inequity, and behavior intention. The study showed that perceived threat factor contributes to the low level of user intention toward SHARE ITS.

Unfortunately, physics-based differentiable rendering remains challenging, due to the complex and typically nonlinear relation between pixel intensities and scene parameters. We introduce a differential theory of radiative transfer, which shows how individual components of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) can be differentiated with respect to arbitrary differentiable changes of a scene. Our theory encompasses the same generality as the standard RTE, allowing differentiation while accurately handling a large range of light transport phenomena such as volumetric absorption and scattering, anisotropic phase functions, and heterogeneity. To numerically estimate the derivatives given by our theory, we introduce an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator supporting arbitrary surface and volumetric configurations.

Two major critical challenges faced by IoUT applications are the low reliable data delivery due to the poor quality of underwater acoustic links, and the high energy cost for underwater wireless communication. In this paper, we tackle both challenges by proposing the PCon protocol. The PCon is a power-controlled opportunistic routing protocol for data routing in duty-cycled IoUTs. At each hop, the PCon protocol selects the most suitable transmission power, from a set of discrete transmission power levels, to maintain a reasonable data delivery ratio while reducing the energy consumption of duty-cycled IoUTs. To do so, the PCon takes into consideration the energy cost for delivering the data packet, calculated as a function if the probability of having the next-hop node awake during the transmission.

Matos, Bruno, O.P.Automatic and accurate recognition of hate speech is a difficult job. In addition to the inherent ambiguity of the natural language, deep understanding of the linguistic structure is imperative. Usually, discriminatory discourse does not make use of typical expressions and often abuse of sarcasm. Good knowledge of world and assessment of context are thus highly demanded. Several approaches have been proposed for automating hate speech recognition task. Many of them consider a combination of strategies in order to achieve better results: character-based or word-based N-grams, lexical features such as the presence or absence of negative words, classes or expressions indicative of insult, punctuation marks, repetition of letters, the presence of emoji, etc. The solitary use of linguistic features such as POS tagging have shown itself inefficient. The recent usage of neural networks to create a distributed representation of the sentences within a hate speech corpus is a promising path. Unfortunately, providing such a corpus is hard. Except for the English language, hate speech corpora are rarely found. This work proposes a cross-lingual approach to automatically recognize hate speech in Portuguese language, leveraging the knowledge of English corpora. A deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model has been trained and many different experimentation scenarios were set to deal with embeddings, TFIDF, N-grams, GloVe vocabulary and so on.

Treating the heart disease health problems is considerably costly. In the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR), heart patients are now able to monitor their heart conditions using heart disease monitoring applications on any mobile devices. Usability factors such as ease of use, ease of learning, efficiency, flexibility and the attitude of users towards the applications are deemed important in determining the usability of such mobile applications. This paper employs a systematic literature review method in analyzing 1,339 relevant articles. Based on the review, this paper theoretically contributes by proposing a conceptual model that integrates haptics tactile feedback into heart disease monitoring mobile applications with the aim of enhancing the usability of the heart disease monitoring mobile applications. This is expected to lead to ease of health monitoring by both patients and health professionals, and potentially reduce the frequency of visits to hospitals and the cost of medical expenses.

1051,1082,1082,Neural state machine for character-scene interactions,"We propose Neural State Machine, a novel data-driven framework to guide characters to achieve goal-driven actions with precise scene interactions. Even a seemingly simple task such as sitting on a chair is notoriously hard to model with supervised learning. This difficulty is because such a task involves complex planning with periodic and non-periodic motions reacting to the scene geometry to precisely position and orient the character. Our proposed deep auto-regressive framework enables modeling of multi-modal scene interaction behaviors purely from data. Given high-level instructions such as the goal location and the action to be launched there, our system computes a series of movements and transitions to reach the goal in the desired state. To allow characters to adapt to a wide range of geometry such as different shapes of furniture and obstacles, we incorporate an efficient data augmentation scheme to randomly switch the 3D geometry while maintaining the context of the original motion. To increase the precision to reach the goal during runtime, we introduce a control scheme that combines egocentric inference and goal-centric inference. We demonstrate the versatility of our model with various scene interaction tasks such as sitting on a chair, avoiding obstacles, opening and entering through a door, and picking and carrying objects generated in real-time just from a single model.",60076047,Adobe Inc.,San Jose,United States,['1704'],26.75,0.006009070294784585,0.4458616780045351,1,0.1510204081632653,0.0163265306122449,0.27074235807860264

All rights reserved.Customer retention is one of the main objectives of Customer Relation Management (CRM) and customer churn occurs when the customer terminates from a company or a service. The telecommunication sector has an important place in people‚Äôs business and daily life and has become one of the most important industrial enterprises of our time. Now a day‚Äôs flexibility of customer mobility in the telecommunications sector is caused by the customer churn easier. Best feature identification is one of the problems encountered in predicting telecommunication sector customer retention process. The proposed churn prediction model consist of two stages: In stage one, feature selection techniques like Rough set based attribute selection (RSAS), Information gain (IG) and feature deduction techniques like Principle component analysis (PCA), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) used to find the reduced attributes. In next stage the identified features combines classifications of Decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support vector machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) to address the limitation of high dimensional classification.

1054,1085,1085,Non-deterministic behavior analysis for embedded software based on probabilistic model checking,"The real-Time interaction between embedded software and its external environment is conducted through the interrupt mechanism. Since the interrupt request is random and responds according to priority, the execution of embedded software is non-sequential, which leads to the non-deterministic software behaviors. If these non-deterministic behaviors can be quantitatively pre-Analyzed during the software design phase, the reliability of embedded software can be improved effectively. In this paper, we first provide an embedded software behavior model based on extended deterministic and stochastic Petri nets (EDSPN). Through EDSPN, the interrupt behavior of embedded software can be effectively modeled. Then we put forward a probabilistic model checking method of Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) for EDSPN to analyze embedded software behavior. For alleviating the state explosion problem, the above method uses the bounded model checking (BMC) technique. We present the model checking methods and the probability metric calculation methods for CSL operators under bounded semantics. Finally, by analyzing the EDSPN model of embedded software with multiple interrupts, we compare the analytical capabilities of BMC method and non-BMC method. The experiment shows that when the state space of EDSPN is large and is hard to calculate, the bounded checking algorithm can be used to approximate the software behavior.

Multicast is an efficient means of delivering contents to multiple users while efficiently utilizing network resources. Layered streaming, e.g., scalable video coding (SVC) provides an excellent solution to handle channel diversities in wireless multicast. This paper presents a cooperative multicast scheme for scalable video content delivery in D2D-enabled heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets). To extend the multicast service beyond base stations (BSs), D2D links are used to help relay content for cellular multicast. Network coding (NC), implemented through random linear network coding (RLNC) with unequal error protection (UEP) is incorporated in layered contents to enhance reliability and throughput. This paper tries to optimize the multicast scheduling procedures, aiming to assign the optimal modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) for transmissions. The constraints on cache size, backhaul capacity and channel fading are comprehensively considered. Besides, this paper also presents a interference-aware approach for D2D link selection in order to further improve the cooperative multicast.

Instead, computing education must be infused into all other required courses reaching all students through curriculum-integrated computing activities. This will pose challenges as students in these settings have an increasingly wide range of programming backgrounds. Additionally, teachers must feel comfortable not only teaching programming, but doing so in a meaningful context that integrates coding into their course topics. To truly meet the scale of this challenge, teachers will need to be able to develop meaningful integrated programming lessons, and have the supports necessary to implement them in a wide-variety of classes with students of vastly different skill-levels. This research will investigate two major means of aiding the rapid development and deployment of integrated block-based programming lessons in K-12 courses. The first will be through exploring design patterns for these integrated lessons, specifically focusing on how different activity types, scaffolding, and progressions affect classroom and student programming outcomes.

1061,1092,1092,Optimal Placement of Inertia and Primary Control: A Matrix Perturbation Theory Approach,"The increasing penetration of new renewable sources of electrical energy reduces the overall mechanical inertia available in power grids. This raises a number of issues regarding grid stability over short to medium time scales. A number of approaches have been proposed to compensate for this inertia reduction by deploying substitution inertia in the form of synchronous condensers, flywheels or power-electronic-based synthetic inertia. These resources are limited and expensive; therefore, a key issue is to determine how to optimally place them in the power grid, for instance, to mitigate voltage angle and frequency disturbances following an abrupt power loss. Performance measures in the form of H2}-norms have recently been introduced to evaluate the overall magnitude of such disturbances. However, despite the mathematical convenience of these measures, analytical results can only be obtained under rather unrealistic assumptions of a uniform damping-to-inertia ratio or a homogeneous distribution of the inertia and/or primary control. Here, we introduce and apply matrix perturbation theory to obtain analytical results for an optimal inertia and primary control placement in the case where both are heterogeneous. This powerful method allows us to construct two simple algorithms that independently optimize the geographical distribution of the inertia and primary control. The algorithms are then implemented for a numerical model of the synchronous transmission grid of continental Europe with different initial configurations. We find that an inertia redistribution has little effect on the grid performance but that the primary control should be redistributed on the slow modes of the network, where the intrinsic grid dynamic requires more time to damp frequency disturbances. For a budget-constraint optimization, we show that increasing the amount of primary control in the periphery of the grid, without changing the inertia distribution, achieves 90 % or more of the maximal possible optimization, already for relatively moderate budgets.",60101868,Haute Ecole Sp√©cialis√©e de Suisse Occidentale,Delemont,Switzerland,['1700'],27.181818181818183,0.06726359577922078,0.4748816287878788,1,0.0960960960960961,0.003003003003003003,0.23076923076923078

1071,1102,1102,Survey on air characteristics evaluation and prediction,". All rights reserved.--Massive growth has created challenges for quality of city life. The tremendous increase in vehicular pollution and industrial air nuisance has led to the concentration of air pollutants in major metropolitan cities. Preserving and monitoring air quality has become one of the most essential activities under sustainable development. Air pollution levels in many cities are at alarming levels and peak points according to World Health Organization (WHO). Limit for gaseous pollutants and particulate matter have almost been breached in hundreds of cities. In this paper, we hereby propose a heuristic model by clubbing meteorological factors (MFs) and air pollutant concentration (APCs) to infer air quality in a region. With this consideration, we are applying machine learning trends to predict whether the region is habitable or not and thus identify the chances of occurrence of air borne diseases. We target our air pollution prediction method to be prototyped and tested at the city of Delhi, India as it is at the forefront, battling against air pollution and such extensive experiments of real time air pollution forecasting on real data would demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.",60117285,"SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram Campus",Chennai,India,['1700'],21.0,0.1695833333333333,0.4833333333333333,1,0.1111111111111111,0.033816425120772944,0.3014354066985646

This paper proposes a Feature augmentation based hybrid collaborative filtering using Tree Boosted Ensemble (TBE), for prediction. The proposed TBE recommender is formulated in two phases. The first phase creates category based training matrix using similar user profiles, while the second phase employs the boosted tree based model to predict ratings for the items. A threshold based filtering is finally applied to obtain precise recommendations for the user. Experiments were conducted with MovieLens dataset and performances were measured in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed model was observed to exhibit MAE levels of 0.64 and RMSE levels of 0.77 with a variation level of ¬±0.1.

1074,1105,1105,Easvd: A modified method to enhance the authentication for spice virtual desktop,"Virtual Desktop (VD) provides a convenient way for users to operate their virtual machines on different types of terminals. SPICE is an excellent protocol for the VD display. However, there are still several threats when using the original SPICE in the high-level scenarios. The threats are mainly due to the fact that the original SPICE ignores the confidentiality of the VD. The threats contain the data interaction like copying, falsifying, and deleting between VDs & different physical terminals. Furthermore, the original SPICE authentication is a one-factor method based on the IP address and password of the user. We bind each VD to a specific authorized terminal to reduce the threat posed by the data interaction between VDs and physical terminals in the high-level security scenarios proposed in our paper. At the same time, we propose a two-factor authentication method which includes physical terminals authentication and user-password authentication. We also reinforce the security of the VD by putting forward a modified way to storage the password. Our approach to intensify the VDs authentication has been implemented in terminals based on SPICE and Libvirt. Our method can effectively prevent the unauthorized users from illegal logging into the VD on the illegal physical terminals, even when the correct password is intercepted by unauthorized users.

Our Cluster works exactly similar to current day‚Äôs supercomputers. The motivation is to create a small sized, cheap device on which students and researchers can get hands on experience. There is a master node, which interacts with user and all other nodes are slave nodes. Load is equally divided among all nodes and they send their results to master. Master combines those results and show the final output to the user. For communication between nodes we have created a network over Ethernet. We are using MPI4py, which a Python based implantation of Message Passing Interface (MPI) and MPICH which also an open source implementation of MPI and allows us to code in C, C++ and Fortran. MPI is a standard for writing codes for such clusters. We have written parallel programs of Monte Carlo‚Äôs Simulation for finding value of pi and prime number generator in Python and C++ making use of MPI4py and MPICH respectively.

By conducting the attack in parallel, the speed of our method increases about 11.6 times compared with the previous work, so that we can continually monitor the guard relays of 13604 hidden services for 7 months. And we have an interesting finding by analyzing the distribution of hidden services binding on each guard relays. The distribution is quite uneven, that only 20% of guard relays serve about 89.32% hidden services. These guard relays would bind all hidden services at least one time in about 17 months.

1080,1111,1111,Learned large field-of-view imaging with thin-plate optics,"Typical camera optics consist of a system of individual elements that are designed to compensate for the aberrations of a single lens. Recent computational cameras shift some of this correction task from the optics to post-capture processing, reducing the imaging optics to only a few optical elements. However, these systems only achieve reasonable image quality by limiting the field of view (FOV) to a few degrees - effectively ignoring severe off-axis aberrations with blur sizes of multiple hundred pixels. In this paper, we propose a lens design and learned reconstruction architecture that lift this limitation and provide an order of magnitude increase in field of view using only a single thin-plate lens element. Specifically, we design a lens to produce spatially shift-invariant point spread functions, over the full FOV, that are tailored to the proposed reconstruction architecture. We achieve this with a mixture PSF, consisting of a peak and and a low-pass component, which provides residual contrast instead of a small spot size as in traditional lens designs. To perform the reconstruction, we train a deep network on captured data from a display lab setup, eliminating the need for manual acquisition of training data in the field. We assess the proposed method in simulation and experimentally with a prototype camera system. We compare our system against existing single-element designs, including an aspherical lens and a pinhole, and we compare against a complex multielement lens, validating high-quality large field-of-view (i.e. 53¬∞) imaging performance using only a single thin-plate element.",60092945,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology,Jeddah,Saudi Arabia,['1704'],24.8,0.00606060606060606,0.4873376623376624,1,0.11864406779661017,0.010169491525423728,0.2909090909090909

However, actual medical images always suffer from limited spatial resolution, due to imaging equipment and imaging parameters (e.g. scanning time of CT images). Recently, machine learning, especially deep learning techniques, have brought revolution to image super resolution reconstruction. Motivated by these achievements, in this paper, we propose a novel super resolution method for medical images based on an improved generative adversarial networks. To obtain useful image details as much as possible while avoiding the fake information in high frequency, the original squeeze and excitation block is improved by strengthening important features while weakening non-important ones. Then, by embedding the improved squeeze and excitation block in a simplified EDSR model, we build a new image super resolution network. Finally, a new fusion loss that can further strengthen the constraints on low-level features is designed for training our model. The proposed image super resolution model has been validated on the public medical images, and the results show that visual effects of the reconstructed images by our method, especially in the case of high upscaling factors, outperform state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods such as SRGAN, EDSR, VDSR and D-DBPN.",60003353,Harbin Engineering University,Harbin,China,['1700'],23.11111111111111,0.06983733438278894,0.473442870261052,1,0.092,0.024,0.34177215189873417

Optimal UAV placement is an NP-complete problem: it requires a closed-form utility function that defines the environment and the UAV constraints, it is not unique and must be defined for each new UAV mission. This complex and time-consuming process hinders the development of UAV-networks in civil applications. We propose a method that leverages previous network expert solutions of UAV-network deployment to learn the expert's untold utility function form demonstrations only. This is especially interesting as it may be difficult for the inspection expert to explicit his expertise into such a function as it is too complex. Once learned, our model generates a utility function which maxima match expert UAV locations.

Considering the influence of four kinds of real-time information on vehicle routing and vehicle scheduling, including new requests arriving gradually, old requests being modified or canceled, traffic congestion and vehicle breakdowns, a dynamic vehicle routing model based on a dynamic pick-up and delivery problem considering multiple dynamic events in a real-world environment (DPDP-MDE) is established. A dynamic algorithm framework is designed to solve the problem, the tabu search (TS) algorithm and the adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm are adopted to improve the quality of the initial solution, and the dynamic insertion method is adopted to solve the synchronization problem of unfixed requests (that is, unaccepted customer requests and modified requests) and new requests. The experimental results show that the model and dynamic algorithm framework proposed in this paper can effectively solve the dynamic pick-up and delivery problem with time windows (DPDP-TW). At different scheduling time horizons T, the TS algorithm improves the initial solution by an average of 3.11% and the ALNS algorithm by an average of 9.98%. Under different degrees of urgency, compared to the ALNS algorithm, the quality of the solution produced by the TS algorithm is not high, but the computation time is very small and it is relatively stable.

Meeting the stringent performance requirements regarding jitter for the Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) over Ethernet is challenging. In this paper, a time division multiplexing (TDM) slot-based scheduling (TSS) algorithm is proposed to minimize the jitter; this algorithm consists of two main modules: slot greedy allocation and low-delay collaboration. Specifically, low-complexity slot greedy allocation aims to solve the NP-hard problem caused by the optimal slot allocation, and the low-delay collaboration among different switches is employed to avoid the large delays caused by a strict slot assignment. In the Ethernet-based fronthaul network, the simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional benchmark algorithm, the TSS algorithm ensures lower jitter, and this significant decrease is achieved without incurring a large delay.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",30.4,0.08853174603174603,0.4836904761904762,1,0.11855670103092783,0.0979381443298969,0.43333333333333335
1089,1120,1120,Mitsuba 2: A retargetable forward and inverse renderer,"Modern rendering systems are confronted with a dauntingly large and growing set of requirements: In their pursuit of realism, physically based techniques must increasingly account for intricate properties of light, such as its spectral composition or polarization. To reduce prohibitive rendering times, vectorized renderers exploit coherence via instruction-level parallelism on CPUs and GPUs. Differentiable rendering algorithms propagate derivatives through a simulation to optimize an objective function, e.g., to reconstruct a scene from reference images. Catering to such diverse use cases is challenging and has led to numerous purpose-built systems-partly, because retrofitting features of this complexity onto an existing renderer involves an error-prone and infeasibly intrusive transformation of elementary data structures, interfaces between components, and their implementations (in other words, everything). We propose Mitsuba 2, a versatile renderer that is intrinsically retargetable to various applications including the ones listed above. Mitsuba 2 is implemented in modern C++ and leverages template metaprogramming to replace types and instrument the control flow of components such as BSDFs, volumes, emitters, and rendering algorithms. At compile time, it automatically transforms arithmetic, data structures, and function dispatch, turning generic algorithms into a variety of efficient implementations without the tedium of manual redesign.

Despite the recent success of DRL, the learned controller is viable for a single character. Changes in body size and proportions require learning controllers from scratch.

A single parametric controller enables us to simulate and control various characters having different heights, weights, and body proportions. The users are allowed to create new characters through body shape parameters, and they can control the characters immediately. Our characters can also change their body shapes on the fly during simulation. The key to the success of our approach includes the adaptive sampling of body shapes that tackles the challenges in learning parametric controllers, which relies on the marginal value function that measures control capabilities of body shapes.We demonstrate parametric controllers for various physically simulated characters such as bipeds, quadrupeds, and underwater animals.",60013682,Seoul National University,Seoul,South Korea,['1704'],20.0,0.13705118411000766,0.4047364400305577,1,0.13114754098360656,0.01092896174863388,0.3463687150837989

However, this wide adoption of SDNs is posing real challenges and concerns in terms of security aspects. The main challenges are how to provide proper authentication, access control, data privacy, and data integrity among others for the API-driven orchestration of network routing. Herein, the Software Defined Perimeter (SDP) is proposed as a framework to provide an orchestration of connections. The expectation is a framework that restricts network access and connections between objects on the SDN-enabled network infrastructures. There are several potential benefits as a result of the integration between SDP systems and SDNs. In particular, it provides a completely scalable and managed security solution. Consequently, it leads to flexible deployment that can be tailored to fit the need of any generic network security perimeter.

This paper aims to develop a computational structure for an intelligent translator to recognize the isolated dynamic gestures of the ArSL. In our proposed system we build a datasets for ArSL from scratch of, we used 100-sign vocabulary from ArSL, we have applied 1500 video files for these signs. These signs were divided into five types of signs, recognizing a sign language gestures from dynamic gestures could be a difficult analysis issue. This paper solves the problem using gradient based key frame extraction technique. These key frames are useful for splitting continuous language gestures into sequence of signs for removing uninformative frames. After splitting of gestures every sign has been treated as isolated gesture. Then features of pre-processed gestures are extracted using Intensity Histogram by integrating with Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features. Experiments are performed on our own ArSL dataset and the matching between the ArSL and Arabic text is tested by Euclidian distance. The evaluation of the proposed system for the automatic recognition and translation for isolated dynamic ArSL gestures has proven to be effective and highly accurate.

The previous study has been using PUCK as a new index to evaluate the ANS activity and MSE for analysis of cardiovascular disease. However, the indication of PUCK showed another possibility of the cardiac modulation. Therefore, the objective of this research is to know the relation between MSE with ANS activity from several physical activities using treadmill exercise. An accurate control of heartbeat interval during exercise is measured using wearable electrocardiograph to get high precision. MSE analysis may provide to detect several cardiovascular diseases. The information related to the entanglement of the ANS of the heart rate using MSE is lacking, even though the MSE method in the clinical analysis is widely accepted. As a result, MSE in the large scales tend to decrease following the change of posture and the increasing of speed during treadmill exercise.

The control logic maintains the motor current which can be represented as a sum of two components, one of which is proportional to the input signal, and the other one corresponds to the error of control moment implementation. It is shown that the system with a fuzzy controller, which implements the variable gain on the error channel, eliminates the torque pulsation and reduces the time of transient processes while adjusting the control actions. The system operation has been simulated by means of MatLab Simulink software to confirm viability of the proposed control loop.

Many organizations have not realized that BCP is essential to their business continuity. Organizations more concern with their main goal (profitability and market growth), rather than business continuity. Regarding the organization awareness of business continuity, many organization recognizes disruptions, but they did not aware of preparing BCP. There were no specific standard or framework for BCP that could use as a best practice. This research is a continuation of previous research, which has proposed with a specific procedure, including all elements and activities. However, this framework still has shortcomings in testing empirical studies. This paper aims to analyze the suitability of the framework with various types of organizations. The framework has been tested in four cases: banking, 2 service-company, and manufacture. The results show that some activities of the BCP require further adjustment. Therefore, researchers need to readjust the BCP framework by changing several activities, to fit all type of organizations.

A locally resonant phononic crystal (LRPC) structure called square spiral with circle inside is employed to verify the performance of the present scheme. Four geometric parameters, i.e., the side length of square scatterer, the length of each elastic beam, the thickness of elastic beams, and the radii of inner circles, are considered to obtain the corresponding influences on band gaps (BGs) using finite element method (FEM). According to the significant influences of the late two key parameters, a 2-factor (the radii of inner circles, and the thickness of elastic beams) and 7-level experiment is designed to obtain optimal BGs with better low-frequency broadband properties. By 29 times calculations using FEM for the different combination of levels, three relationships between the 2-factor and the first BG's starting frequency, the first BG's bandwidth, and the second BG's bandwidth, are obtained and severed as inputs to the software of response surface methodology (RSM). The closed-form expressions of the three relationships are finally obtained to construct optimization models and result in the optimal band gaps (BGs) between 190-300Hz and 500-600Hz.

1116,1148,1148,Online Camera-Gimbal-Odometry System Extrinsic Calibration for Fixed-Wing UAV Swarms,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms show a broad application prospect in the future. For most individuals of UAV swarms, their perception systems consist of onboard camera, gimbal and odometry. It is necessary to efficiently obtain accurate extrinsic parameters of camera-gimbal-odometry systems for UAV swarms. Traditional extrinsic calibration methods for camera-gimbal-odometry system often need manual assistances. For a large number of individuals of UAV swarms, it is time-and labor-consuming to complete the calibration using traditional methods. To tackle this problem, we propose an online extrinsic calibration algorithm and design a parallel procedure to realize an efficient calibration for UAV swarms. Without any dependence on manual operation and communication with ground station, the calibration for each individual is completed on onboard processor. Instead of manual labelling, a fast and accurate detection module is firstly built for samples auto-labeling. Facing the challenge of limited computing power of onboard processor, our auto-labeling algorithm shows a strong real-time capability and robustness. Then, an optimization module is developed to iteratively refine the extrinsic. Using multiple fixed-wing UAVs, online calibration experiments were conducted in larger-scale outdoor, and the results validated the feasibility of our method.

One aspect of the work is the proposed inverter topology that integrates a three-time step-up ratio and capacitor voltage self-balance capability. Compared to the existing single-phase seven-level inverters, the proposed inverter reduces the number of power switches and the voltage stresses across them. The other aspect of the work is a new way to implement level-shifted modulation schemes (level-shifted carrier modulation scheme and level-shifted sine modulation scheme) by three basic steps: (1) obtaining modulation logic based on Karnaugh Map technique; (2) determining a level-shifted modulation scheme; and (3) software implementation using the general-purpose input output(GPIO) terminals and CPU timer interruption function of a DSP chip. Therefore, complex trigonometric calculations of the traditional implementation methods for carrier modulation schemes are replaced by simple logic operations of the proposed implementation method, and thus extra logic chips used in the traditional implementation methods are not necessary for the proposed implementation method.

In general, these perceptual qualities are often degraded when reproduced as a digital color image. The authors have aimed to edit the material appearance of an image as measured by a general camera and reproduce it on a general display device. In their previous study, the authors found that the pupil diameter decreases slightly when observing the surface properties of an object and proposed an algorithm called ‚ÄúPuRet‚Äù for enhancing the material appearance based on the physiological models of the pupil and retina. However, to obtain an accurate reproduction, it was necessary to manually adjust two types of adaptation parameters in PuRet as related to the retinal response for each scene and the particular characteristics of the display device. This study realizes the management of the appearance of material objects on display devices by automatically deriving the optimum parameters in PuRet from captured RAW image data. The results indicate that the authors succeeded in estimating an adaptation parameter from the median value of the scene luminance as estimated from a RAW image. They also succeeded in estimating another adaptation parameter from the average value of the scene luminance and the luminance contrast value of the output display device.

1121,1153,1153,Adaptive function launching acceleration in serverless computing platforms,"Serverless computing has emerged as a new compelling paradigm for the deployment of applications and services, which enables developers to focus more on business logic rather than on infrastructure. Serverless computing platform enables the function container scales to zero, which results in a serious problem called cold start. Cold start severely affects the responsiveness of serverless computing platform and limits the use and adoption of serverless computing by a broader range of applications. The traditional strategies reduce the cold start latency at the expense of resources. How to simultaneously minimize the cold start latency and reduce the resources consumption of strategy implementation is a challenging problem. In this paper, we firstly propose an Adaptive Warm-Up Strategy (AWUS) to predict the function invoking time and warm up the functions, thus reducing the cold start latency. We use the function chain model to improve the AWUS. We adopt a fine-grained regression method to predict non-first functions in the function chain more accurately. Secondly, we propose an Adaptive Container Pool Scaling Strategy (ACPSS) to reduce the function launching time. We dynamically adjust the capacity of the container pool to reduce the resources waste. The AWUS and ACPSS work together to reduce the cold start latency and the resources waste.

An electro-hydraulic servo system (EHSS), which consists of two hydraulic cylinders, two movable headgear sheaves and lots of indispensable sensors, is employed to actively coordinate two wire tensions. The nonlinear dynamic model of the DRWHS is introduced and it is divided into two subsystems, i.e., the hoisting system and the EHSS with state space representations. However, as a complex machine-electricity-hydraulic system, the accurate dynamic model of the DRWHS is usually hard to obtain. Therefore, a flatness-based controller (FBC), which is insensitive to unmodeled characteristics of the dynamic model and measurement noises of sensors, is proposed to improve the tension coordination of two wire tensions of the DRWHS. The explicit FBC design schemes for the DRWHS and the control law are presented, and the stability of the proposed controller are proved by defining a Lyapunov function. The controller proposed is characterized by no derivatives of state variables and lower controller design complication so that measurement noises of sensors and unmodeled characteristics are not amplified.

1130,1162,1162,Revisiting asynchronous rumor spreading in the blockchain era,"Asynchronous rumor spreading, or epidemic algorithms, are a class of data dissemination protocols that have been used throughout the years for a large variety of distributed applications. The emergence of large-scale, public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, has reinvigorated research interest in these protocols as they are employed to disseminate pending transactions and confirmed blocks in their peer-To-peer (P2P) networks. Efficient, timely and fault-Tolerant information dissemination is vital for blockchain networks as it affects issues ranging from security to block finality. Recent works have analyzed the structural properties of blockchain network overlay graphs. Their findings show that they have inherent similarities to those of social networks, such as power-law degree distributions, small diameters and star-like communities. In this work, we present an experimental analysis of the vanilla asynchronous push & pull rumor spreading protocol that is employed by public blockchains. This protocol, although robust and scalable, can be substantially improved. We demonstrate this by analyzing the effect that multiple parameters have on the protocol's performance, such as using memory to avoid contacting the same neighbor twice in a row, varying the stopping criteria of nodes to decide when to stop spreading the rumor, employing more sophisticated neighbor selection policies instead of the standard uniform random choice and others. Prior works have focused on either providing theoretical upper bounds on the number of rounds needed to spread the rumor to all nodes, or, propose improvements by adjusting isolated parameters. To our knowledge, our work is the first to study how multiple parameters affect the protocol's behavior both in isolation and combination and under a wide range of values. Moreover, prior theoretical works have studied rumor spreading only on bidirectional social topologies. Our study examines the behavior of the protocol in multiple topology classes. These include bidirectional, directed, and also a special type of social topologies, called signed topologies, which resemble more closely the topologies of blockchain P2P networks. Our work is the first to indicate and deal with how chains of communities that are sparsely connected to the core of the network can hamper the rumor's spreading. Thus, we complement prior theoretical work to shed light on how the protocol behaves in practical, real-world, large scale distributed systems. Finally, through our detailed analysis, we demonstrate how a few simple additions to the protocol deliver a percentage decrease of the time required to inform all nodes by a maximum of 99.69% and an average of 86.04%.",60028900,National and Kapodistrian University of Athens,Athens,Greece,['1708'],25.3125,0.07176079734219269,0.32583056478405314,1,0.12366737739872068,0.014925373134328358,0.3076923076923077
1131,1163,1163,NLP for the Generation of Training Data Sets for Ontology-Guided Weakly-Supervised Machine Learning in Digital Pathology,"The combination of ontologies with machine learning (ML) approaches is a hot topic and not yet extensively investigated but having great future potential. This is due to the general fact that both, ontologies and ML, constitute two indispensable technologies for domain-specific knowledge extraction, actively used in knowledge-based systems. Whilst the primary goal of both these approaches are the same, knowledge discovery, little is yet known about how the two sources of knowledge can be successfully integrated. The main data source in digital pathology are whole slide images. For the effective generation of sufficiently large and high-quality training data we need to extract in addition information from medical reports, containing non-standardized text. Since full annotation on pixel level would be impracticably expensive, a practical solution is in weakly-supervised ML. In the project described in this paper we used ontology-guided natural language processing (NLP) for term extraction and a decision tree built with an expert-curated classification system.

Nonetheless, even with the increased range, 1-hop connectivity can be difficult to achieve in real-world deployment scenario, especially for remote and rural areas where density of gateways is low and where devices/gateway are usually deployed for a specific application. Therefore a smart and transparent 2-hop approach has been proposed in a previous work to leverage these connectivity issues.

But only a few studies to date have examined group influence in online social networks (OSNs). In this paper, a Factor Graph-based Group Influence model (F2GI) is proposed to depict the influence of perceived groups on a user. First, we analyze individuals' group environments and propose definitions and detecting methods of two types of groups: following groups and interacting groups. Secondly, based on these groups, we quantity the groups' features and propose the F2GI model able to describe group influence. Finally, using the retweet behaviors as the primarily manifestations of group influence, we apply our model to predict individuals' retweet behaviors and to validate how much influence the group puts on individuals. The results show that our group influence model can depict group influence more effectively and predict the actions of users who are affected by perceived groups accurately with social psychology ideas than classical machine learning methods.

1134,1166,1166,Autonomous Flying WiFi Access Point,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aka drones, are widely used civil and commercial applications. A promising one is to use the drones as relying nodes to extend the wireless coverage. However, existing solutions only focus on deploying them to predefined locations. After that, they either remain stationary or only move in predefined trajectories throughout the whole deployment. In the open outdoor scenarios such as search and rescue or large music events, etc., users can move and cluster dynamically. As a result, network demand will change constantly over time and hence will require the drones to adapt dynamically. In this paper, we present a proof of concept implementation of an UAV access point (AP) which can dynamically reposition itself depends on the users movement on the ground. Our solution is to continuously keeping track of the received signal strength from the user devices for estimating the distance between users devices and the drone, followed by trilateration to localise them. This process is challenging because our on-site measurements show that the heterogeneity of user devices means that change of their signal strengths reacts very differently to the change of distance to the drone AP. Our initial results demonstrate that our drone is able to effectively localise users and autonomously moving to a position closer to them.",60024666,National Central University Taiwan,Chung-Li,Taiwan,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",21.3,0.14789915966386555,0.5274649859943977,1,0.1297071129707113,0.016736401673640166,0.3050847457627119
1135,1167,1167,An Adaptation Aware Model to Predict Engagement on HTTP Adaptive Live Streaming,"Today, video streaming is a well-established application on the internet. Providers are able of transmitting video globally, in large-scale, although there are still some challenges, such as offering high video quality for all clients, particularly in live transmission, due to limited butter size and intense client arrival. Low quality result in low engagement (i.e. client permanence). To increase engagement, the provider can adopt strategies to anticipate (i.e. predict) quality losses. To make this possible, the provider needs to learn what session characteristics lead to an early session abandonment. If a new session presents such characteristics, the provider can presume that it will terminate prematurely. To implement an accurate prediction scheme we must choose a feature set able to explain the user permanence (i.e. engagement). Traditional prediction approaches use user-centered quality metrics such stall rate and average bitrate. In our data-set, these metrics give a prediction accuracy of less than 70%. To improve this, we propose a new set of metrics that explores the client adaptation flow. We model it through Markov chains and show that this increases the prediction accuracy up to 82%. Besides this, grouping similar sessions and train a predictor for each group can increase the accuracy.

However, the impact of the experience of those who use these techniques on their efficacy has been little explored. This article addresses this research gap through an experimental study to evaluate the impact of experience of software architecture decision-making team members on the efficacy of TaSPeR (Tactics Selection Poker), a software architecture tactics selection technique based on Planning Poker. A set of 24 IT professional developers was divided into two 'expert' teams and two 'novice' teams (of six people each); each team had to solve two scenarios, one using TaSPeR and one using an ad-hoc technique; the scenarios were crossed to mitigate possible learning effects. The study compared the effectiveness of teams in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy (of selected tactics versus a ground truth); accuracy was found best. Initial results suggest that TaSPeR improves the accuracy of novice teams but hurts the accuracy of expert teams. This result is quite unexpected and begs replication with even larger populations of IT professionals (no easy task).

According to the characteristics of transmission energy consumption, a MIP (mixed integer programming) model called FAT-WSN (fragmentation aggregation transmission WSN) is proposed to minimize the number of data fragments. Moreover, we propose an iterative solution for this MIP problem with elasticity and low complexity. The main optimization method for this model is to adjust topology and traffic distribution. It focuses on optimizing the number of data transfers without modifying any data and without introducing a compression calculation burden. Finally, simulation and small-scale real node verifications are performed for the FAT-WSN scheme. The experimental results show that FAT-WSN can effectively reduce the number of data transmission and reception, thereby reducing energy consumption and improving network life.

1140,1172,1172,HCNet: An SDN Enabled Virtual Network Management System for Hybrid Clouds,"Hybrid clouds require scalable, high performance virtual networks (VN) to facilitate the resource interoperability among multiple clouds. However, current VNs in hybrid clouds face the following challenges: (1) Management complexity. The VNs in hybrid clouds need to support inter-cloud resource deployment with multi-tenancy and full address space virtualization, and therefore are complex to manage. Meanwhile, the VNs are vulnerable to failures due to their large scale. (2) Performance limitation. Hybrid clouds rely on the Internet to support inter-cloud data transmission. Therefore without a meticulous design, the inter-cloud VNs would suffer from a performance limitation introduced by the Internet, e.g., the intercloud bandwidth provided by the Internet is much lower and more fluctuant than that of the intra-cloud networks. To the best of our knowledge, most existing VN solutions cannot solve both of these challenges simultaneously.In this paper we introduce HCNet, a hybrid cloud virtual network management system. HCNet makes use of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and: (1) supports multi-tenancy and full address space virtualization on both Layer-2 and Layer-3 networks through the help of its elaborated packet processing pipeline, (2) leverages a dynamic load balance policy atop multiple inter-cloud gateways to achieve better performance on inter-cloud virtual networking, (3) maintains master-slave backup relationship based on paxos protocol to deal with controller outages.

1141,1173,1173,Developer payroll approaches for startup environment based on agile project management,"Formulating developer payroll in a software development project is important for organizations to provide an equitable salary formulation that can motivate developers to work professionally. Payroll can also be used as references in planning the cost of software development projects in order to meet startup financial success. In the literature, developer payroll estimations can be obtained by multiplying the number of working hours on a project with the developer's wage. However, multiplying the number of working hours with the developer's wage is considered unfair because each developer has different competencies and performance. In addition, not much attention given to understanding how to estimate developer payroll in software development organizations by considering different competencies and performance. For those reasons, it is important to understand how to overcome the different developer's competencies and performance in developer payroll formulation. Thus, the competency and performance factors can be formulated into the developer payroll. This paper proposes a method in calculating developer payroll for a startup environment based on Agile Project Management by considering the developer's competency and performance parameters.

To achieve the best possible tradeoff between communication delay and computation cost, we adopt the basic concept of (Œ±, Œ≤)-bargaining solution, and formulate a cooperative bargaining game model to solve the UAV computation offloading problem. According to the characteristics of (Œ±, Œ≤)-bargaining solution, the main advantage of our approach is to provide an axiom-based strategic solution for the task offloading problem while dynamically responding to the current UAV conditions. Extensive simulations are performed in order to confirm the performance superiority of our proposed scheme compared to the existing state-of-the-art protocols.

1150,1182,1182,A novel hyperspectral image classification technique using deep multi-dimensional recurrent neural network,"In this paper, a novel Multi-Dimensional Recurrent Deep Neural Network is proposed for classifying hyperspectral images. Deep Learning Networks have developed rapidly with applications in several fields including computer vision, healthcare, bioinformatics and machine learning. Multi-Dimensional Recurrent Deep Neural Networks are a special case of directed acyclic graph networks in which standard Recurrent Neural Networks are realized by giving recurrent connections along all spatio-temporal dimensions of the data and the recurrent connection size is equal to the dimension of the data. In this work, two Recurrent Neural Networks are replaced by one Multi-Dimensional Recurrent Deep Neural Network to learn middle-level visual patterns and spatial dependencies between them. In the last stage, fully connected layers are used to learn a global image representation. Due to the recurrent connections, this method is robust to local distortions such as image rotation and shear.

We version objects at their finest granularity, to make repositories smaller and to allow artists to work concurrently on the same object. Since, for some scene data, computing an optimal set of changes between versions is not computationally feasible, version control systems use heuristics. Compared to prior work, we propose heuristics that are efficient, robust, and independent of the application.

In literature there are some studies on this topic, which show more or less expensive systems, more or less simple to use that have evolved with the evolution of technology while trying to meet the same requirement of quantification. A reduction in the amount of pressure should correspond to a positive response of the spine to the action exerted by the brace. The routine use of systems of this type, absolutely non-invasive, would allow more frequent checks and any brace design errors could be promptly identified and corrected.

In this study, we investigated how a self-applied sMCG can reliably contribute to the differentiation of atrial fibrillation (AFib) from the sinus rhythm (SR). A study sample of 300 elderly adults including 150 AFib cases with persistent and paroxysmal AFib was recruited. Among the 300 subjects, 182 subjects (82 AFib) completed two recordings, one physician-applied and one self-applied. The remaining patients (n = 118) were nervous, in a quite poor condition, and not interested in or capable of concentrating on using a smartphone in the acute setting of a hospital in order to perform the self-applied recording. Two data processing frameworks were used, knowledge-based learning (KL) which is a rule-based algorithm and machine learning (ML) which is an automated classification technique. For the ML approach, we considered four classifiers, namely random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural network (NN). For evaluation, a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was adopted for the ML approach. Compared to physician-interpreted ECG-derived labels, the KL approach predicted AFib with sensitivity values of 0.963 and 0.976, specificity values of 0.980 and 0.929, and F-measure values of 0.972 and 0.952 for the physician-and self-applied measurements, respectively.

All other classifiers delivered quite similar results. The sMCG technology for AFib detection, supported by the KL and ML approaches, can accurately differentiate AFib from SR in both physician-and self-applied recording scenarios.

Based on a new evaluation function, another approach is presented to calculate its mathematical expectation more easily. The results by theoretical analysis and simulation experiment over sampling problems indicate that DOBL is better than the conventional OBL. In engineering application, double-points opposition-based learning differential evolution (DODE) is first developed to accelerate its convergence speed. Experiment results over 58 optimization problems show that DODE has an eclectic convergence speed in a fair competitive environment.

Current researches focused on deciding locally or remotely executing an application, but ignored the specific offloading proportion of application. A full offloading cannot make the best use of client and server resources. In this paper, we propose an innovative reinforcement learning (RL) method to solve the proportional computation problem. We consider a common offloading scenario with time-variant bandwidth and heterogeneous devices, and the device generates applications constantly. For each application, the client has to choose locally or remotely executing this application, and determines the proportion to be offloaded. We formalize the problem as a long-Term optimization problem, and then propose a RL-based algorithm to solve it. The basic idea is to estimate the benefit of posible decisions, of wihch the decision with the maximum benefit is selected. Instead of adopting the original Deep Q Network (DQN), we propose Advanced DQN (ADQN) by adding Priority Buffer Mechanism and Expert Buffer Mechanism, which improves the utilization of samples and overcomes the cold start problem, respectively.

Channel estimation algorithms are used to inspect the multipath effects of frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels. In this paper, Compressed Sensing (CS) based channel estimation method is considered for reconstructing the signal with enhanced spectral effectiveness. According to the theory, the smaller mutual coherence the reconstruction matrix has, the higher success probability the estimation can obtain. For estimating channel information it involves transmitting the known pilot data to the recipient subsequently. The optimum pilot designs are picked through decreasing the mutual coherence of measurement matrix. To outline a pilot the proposed approach plans that can make the framework reconstruction matrix having the smallest mutual coherence. In order to maximize the accuracy of channel estimation and to reduce the computational complexity, an optimization algorithm, Monarch butterfly optimization algorithm (MBOA) is proposed. Using the proposed MBOA, the set of pilot indices are optimally selected from the number of subcarriers, which is a significant issue in channel estimation.",60114590,G.

All rights reserved.--Optical Communication System implies Elements, Devices and Systems. Optical Networks consists of three domains such as Networking, Switching and Routing. Survivability plays an important role in order to protect the network from failures. Hence survivability in optical network determines the interconnectivity between user and system configurations. Today‚Äôs Optical Network Environment (ONE) presents N X N and carries the demands in terms of THz.

Adding parallax, which results in the 3D Ken Burns effect, enables significantly more compelling results. Creating such effects manually is time-consuming and demands sophisticated editing skills. Existing automatic methods, however, require multiple input images from varying viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce a framework that synthesizes the 3D Ken Burns effect from a single image, supporting both a fully automatic mode and an interactive mode with the user controlling the camera. Our framework first leverages a depth prediction pipeline, which estimates scene depth that is suitable for view synthesis tasks. To address the limitations of existing depth estimation methods such as geometric distortions, semantic distortions, and inaccurate depth boundaries, we develop a semantic-aware neural network for depth prediction, couple its estimate with a segmentation-based depth adjustment process, and employ a refinement neural network that facilitates accurate depth predictions at object boundaries. According to this depth estimate, our framework then maps the input image to a point cloud and synthesizes the resulting video frames by rendering the point cloud from the corresponding camera positions. To address disocclusions while maintaining geometrically and temporally coherent synthesis results, we utilize context-aware color- and depth-inpainting to fill in the missing information in the extreme views of the camera path, thus extending the scene geometry of the point cloud. Experiments with a wide variety of image content show that our method enables realistic synthesis results.

Subsequently, two iterative threshold optimization algorithms are extended from methods in conventional cooperative sensing scenarios: the ascending order of Bayesian risk optimization (AOBO) and the person-by-person optimization (PBPO).

It has been applied to various computer graphics applications, including physical simulation, geometry processing, and image processing. However, ADMM can take a long time to converge to a solution of high accuracy. Moreover, many computer graphics tasks involve non-convex optimization, and there is often no convergence guarantee for ADMM on such problems since it was originally designed for convex optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to speed up ADMM using Anderson acceleration, an established technique for accelerating fixed-point iterations. We show that in the general case, ADMM is a fixed-point iteration of the second primal variable and the dual variable, and Anderson acceleration can be directly applied. Additionally, when the problem has a separable target function and satisfies certain conditions, ADMM becomes a fixed-point iteration of only one variable, which further reduces the computational overhead of Anderson acceleration. Moreover, we analyze a particular non-convex problem structure that is common in computer graphics, and prove the convergence of ADMM on such problems under mild assumptions.

The purpose of this research is to produce infrastructure architecture planning and design that forms infrastructure services. As a service, infrastructure architecture has the duty to provide quality and reliable services for end users. Applications and data which are business processes of government institutions require infrastructure parameters that are presented from the service side perception. One way to present infrastructure services for information services in business processes is by planning right before the implementation and deployment phase. At present, the discussion of infrastructure architecture that is widely used is based on the core functions of infrastructure architecture which are limited to the main development and use. These core functions usually focus on availability and modularity (scalability). Availability is usually discussed in the criticality of services that require infrastructure backup.

1188,1220,1220,An analysis of long term yearly water flow trend and its impact on sediment yield in King Talal dam,"Water stress and scarcity are becoming a serious threat to economic growth, social cohesion, and political stability. In Jordan, the problem of water scarcity is further excerpted as a result of wide fluctuations in annual rainfall, population growth, urbanization and a dramatic increase in refugees' numbers. All these factors affect the sediment yield in King Talal Dam (KTD) which is one of the largest dams in Jordan. Accumulation of sediment in KTD influences the storage capacity, operational life and water quality of the dam, thus affects the water uses for irrigation purposes. Hence, quantifying sediment loads, as well as the rainfall and water flow trends, are of high significance for understanding the sediment accumulation and the watershed management of sediment. This study demonstrates an analysis of the long term yearly water flow and sediment yield trend in KTD in the period between the years 1980 to 2017. The distribution of annual water flow and rainfall in the KTD area indicated a high variation and a significant correlation between them. Annual water flow and sediment yield exhibited a corresponding general trend over the study years. Based on the results of this study, the estimated annual sediment yield at KTD for the years 1980-2017, ranged between 0.10 to 2.90 MCM with an estimated sedimentation rate of about 0.393 MCM per year. The estimated total volume of sediment at KTD in 2017 after 39 years since its operation is about 15.32 MCM, which indicates that about 20.4% of the dam's storage capacity of 75 MCM has been lost due to the sediment accumulation. KTD is expected to be completely filled up with sediments in 2208 with an expected life span of about 230 years from the start of the dam's operation. The application of land use management practices for the KTD in the watershed of Zarqa River Basin will reduce soil erosion and accumulation of sediment in KTD, as well as enhance the infiltration rate, groundwater recharge and maintain enough irrigation water downstream to the Jordan valley.

Then channels are fairly assigned in the network by the selected GW between itself and the mesh clients.

Although the anomaly detection based on machine learning has been applied as a common method for this problem, most existing approaches for detecting masquerade attack usually use host-based data to profile user behavior and detect anomaly. However, host-based data are too sensitive to collect, which results in poor universality and makes it difficult for enterprises to deploy. In this paper, we propose a cheap and general masquerade detection method with high accuracy to profile user network behavior and detect anomaly, using network packet sketches (IP, port, protocol, etc As network packet headers with standardized format are non-sensitive, our method is suitable for most enterprises and much cheaper to deploy.

1201,1233,1233,Handheld mobile photography in very low light,"Taking photographs in low light using a mobile phone is challenging and rarely produces pleasing results. Aside from the physical limits imposed by read noise and photon shot noise, these cameras are typically handheld, have small apertures and sensors, use mass-produced analog electronics that cannot easily be cooled, and are commonly used to photograph subjects that move, like children and pets. In this paper we describe a system for capturing clean, sharp, colorful photographs in light as low as 0.3 lux, where human vision becomes monochromatic and indistinct. To permit handheld photography without flash illumination, we capture, align, and combine multiple frames. Our system employs ""motion metering"", which uses an estimate of motion magnitudes (whether due to handshake or moving objects) to identify the number of frames and the per-frame exposure times that together minimize both noise and motion blur in a captured burst. We combine these frames using robust alignment and merging techniques that are specialized for high-noise imagery. To ensure accurate colors in such low light, we employ a learning-based auto white balancing algorithm. To prevent the photographs from looking like they were shot in daylight, we use tone mapping techniques inspired by illusionistic painting: increasing contrast, crushing shadows to black, and surrounding the scene with darkness. All of these processes are performed using the limited computational resources of a mobile device.

1212,1244,1244,Multi-path routing oriented flow statistics collection in software defined networks,"In Software Defined Networks (SDNs), one of the key tasks in control plane is the monitoring and measurement of the whole network. A typical SDN consists of a set of switches and a logically centralized controller responsible for network state monitoring and flow scheduling, to which low cost and efficient flow statistics collection plays an important role. However, existing flow statistics collection methods mainly focus on single-path routing and cannot accurately capture the flow statistics in the case of multi-path routing (MPR), which is widely used in modern networks. In this paper, we are motivated to propose a Multi-Path oriented Flow Statistics Collection (MFSC) strategy to minimize the total communication cost for flow statistics collection. The problem is first formulated into an integer linear programming (ILP) form. After analyzing the complexity of this problem, we present a relaxation-based algorithm with an approximation factor p, where p is the maximum number of switches passed by each flow.

This causes both a degradation of the Quality of Service (QoS) of inter-communicating VMs and an increase in the total migration time due to congestion of the migration link. We consider the problem of scheduling VM migration in those scenarios. In the first stage, we resort to graph partitioning theory in order to partition the VMs into groups with high intra-group communication. In the second stage, we devise an affinity-based scheduling algorithm for controlling the order of the migration groups by considering their inter-group traffic.

However, traditional cubefilled full-coverage node deployment schemes are costly and infeasible to detect target objects due to the considerably redundant nodes. In this paper, we propose a new scheme with a low cost to detect the target in dynamic waters to reduce the cost of the deployment. Our scheme controls the distributed sensors to move and construct an angular sensor barrier through which the target may pass. The profile-based barrier deployment scheme only needs to adjust node depth to reduce movement costs. During depth adjustment, the proposed method takes the node density, the residual energy of the node and the node movement effect into account so that the randomly distributed nodes are sunk at different depths, and the redundant nodes are removed by the 2-Voronoi diagram lemma. We use the simulation experiment to evaluate the coverage and energy consumption during the movement of the nodes.

Methods: We designed and experimentally assessed a cable-driven articulated/continuum manipulator, devised for cardiac valve delivery. Positioning and stiffening were teleoperated, based on cable shortening. Stiffening was parameterized by using the leading tension (LT, ie, tension of the cables driving bending). We assessed positioning (repeatability/reversibility along eight/two bending directions) and stiffening (eight bent configurations). Results: We achieved good repeatability and reversibility (mean errors <1% and 1.5%, respectively, of the workspace characteristic length). Stiffening was effective (up to 9-fold increase, depending on pose). Stiffening was linearly correlated (R2 = 0.92) with LT for all the considered configurations.

A total of 35 patients with known PAOD underwent a dyn-CTA of the lower leg first with 70 kV tube voltage and 30 mL iodinated contrast media. Five minutes later, a standard CTA (s-CTA) of the peripheral runoff from the diaphragm to the toes was scanned. For each of four lower leg artery segments, a runoff score was given by a radiologist according to s-CTA images as a reference standard. The muscle enhancement measured from the dyn-CTA was analyzed by automated muscle segmentation using curve-based Fuzzy C-means (CBFCM) algorithms with three classes for bone, two classes for muscle and one class for fat and background. The muscle enhancement ratio (MER) was calculated for (i) higher enhanced area over total area; and (ii) corresponding average signal value at higher enhanced are over total area. Lower extremities were diagnosed as a normal group (n = 22) with each vessel segment score ‚â§ 1 and runoff score ‚â§ 7, and otherwise as an ischemia group (n = 48). The MER for the ischemia group was significantly different (p < 0.05) than the normal group. There were weak correlations (|r| = 0.47, p < 0.05) between runoff scores and the MER values.

In this work, we develop general analytical models to evaluate the potentials of the Frame Based Equipment (FBE) MAC protocol that can be used by LTE-LAA networks to share the spectrum with Wi-Fi. We derive the expressions of the performance of both networks and we validate them by NS3 simulations. We show that FBE can be a good tradeoff that offers an acceptable LTE-LAA performance while reducing the negative impact on Wi-Fi if both network parameters are well tuned. In particular, increasing the Wi-Fi data rate, increases the performance of LTE-LAA and the overall performance.",60021378,Nokia Bell Labs,Murray,United States,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",23.714285714285715,0.01420246420246421,0.35463702963702964,1,0.1099476439790576,0.09424083769633508,0.2752808988764045

A device (e.g., switch) is connected to multiple controllers in cluster while assigned with one master controller, and the controller with master role is only permitted to manage the device. Therefore, the master controller assignment can affect the network throughput seriously. In this paper, we first study the assignment strategy of two well-known SDN platforms (i.e., OpenDayLight and Open Network Operating System) as well as the assignment mechanisms in the existing literature, analyzing their deficiencies. Meanwhile, we present an adaptive controller assignment so as to maximize the network throughput under the fluctuating network environment.

For experimental identification analysis of the surface condition, we measured the sensor-output data using five different types of test surfaces. To achieve fast dynamic recognition capability of changing surface conditions, we applied an overlapped sliding-window method for the incoming sensor-data stream to generate dynamically four distinguishable well-known features from the raw sensor data. The multi-class k-nearest-neighbor (MC-kNN) classifier rather than a binary classifier is used for online classification of the measured robot-walking pattern and classification-accuracy evaluation. Further, we combine the four studied feature descriptors into a fused multi-feature descriptor rather than invoking each feature descriptor independently, increasing the classification performance. Our analysis results verify that 90.4% maximum overall accuracy with 91.49% average precision can be achieved, demonstrating the realization of a better cost-performance trade-off than in other previous research works.

In this study, we propose two composite indicator indexes (CPI) which built based on composite indicators and weighted linear aggregation methods to evaluate the model's performance. The first CPI is a combination of accuracy, robustness, completeness, and speed. We use it to rank the performance of the three centroid-based classifications models (CANN, L-SCANN, CASMN) on NSL-KDD dataset.

1238,1271,1271,Unknown worker recruitment with budget and covering constraints for mobile crowdsensing,"Mobile crowdsensing, through which a requester can recruit a group of crowd workers via a platform and coordinate them to perform some sensing tasks, has attracted lots of attention recently. However, most of the existing mobile crowdsensing systems assume that the qualities of workers are known in advance. Based on this assumption, they study the task assignment and worker recruitment problems. Unfortunately, the qualities of workers are generally unknown in reality, so the platform must find the tradeoff between exploring and exploiting the qualities by using reinforcement learning. At the same time, all sensing tasks are required to be covered in each round (covering constraint), and the requester usually has a limited budget (budget constraint). In this paper, we study how to recruit unknown workers under the budget and covering constraints so that the total expected achieved qualities can be maximized. To this end, we model the problem as a combination of a maximum weight matching problem and a special multi-Armed bandit problem. We first consider that the recruitment costs of workers are homogeneous and propose a recruitment algorithm with a performance guarantee. Then, we study the heterogenous case and devise a heuristic algorithm.

When collecting the perception information of sensor nodes, the mobile node can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of traditional multi-hop transmission modes. However, the complex marine environment causes the location uncertainty of nodes.

Firstly, the structure of the USN based on the mooring model is introduced and the problem model of path planning is proposed. Secondly, the inevitable communication circle is obtained by analyzing the deviation range and communication range of water surface nodes.

All rights reserved.In recent year the quality and stable power transfer to the transmission line is focused and implemented. The power electronic device is used to enhance the energy stability and reduce the losses in industries and distribution area. In this transmission power is effected in some reasons like sag, swell, overvoltage, under voltage, Total Harmonics distortion (THD) and climatic condition. So this power was not quality in the output side and also harmonics are high so the output was not stable. In this reasons the unified power quality controller is implemented in this work, with help of the proposed Intrinsic Power Prediction Technique (IPPT) to diminishing the THD and provides stable power. The proposed IPPT controller will analyses output of this power system and provides feedback signal to the IPPT controller, this controller give the pulse to converter and with help of the shunt filter and series filter (Hybrid filters) to compensate the power fluctuation presented in the distribution system. In this system the Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) is connected between the high power generation and distribution system. The power variation should be analyzed in both source and load side, so for an proposed IPPT technique with an Hybrid UPQC filters are used to compensate the all power quality problem in the distribution system.

Instead of explicit modeling and simulation of the surface microstructure (which was explored in previous work), we propose a novel direction: Learning the high-frequency directional patterns from synthetic or measured examples, by training a generative adversarial network (GAN). A key challenge in applying GAN synthesis to spatially varying BRDFs is evaluating the reflectance for a single location and direction without the cost of evaluating the whole hemisphere. We resolve this using a novel method for partial evaluation of the generator network. We are also able to control large-scale spatial texture using a conditional GAN approach.

1245,1278,1278,Dynamically adjusting scale of a kubernetes cluster under QoS guarantee,"Nowadays, the container-based virtualization technologies have become very popular due to lightweight nature, scalability, flexibility and others. Kubernetes is one of the most popular container cluster management systems, which enables users to deploy applications on the container easily, so more and more web applications are deployed in a Kubernetes clusters. However, a Kubernetes cluster is generally designed to handle the peak of workloads, so that most of resources are idle in usual time, which results in an huge waste of resource. Hence, it is necessary to design a system to improve the cluster resource utilization and promise Quality of Service (QoS) in a Kubernetes cluster. In this paper, we propose a generic system to dynamically adjust the scale of a Kubernetes cluster, which is able to reduce the waste of resource on the premise of QoS guarantee. The proposed system contains four modules: monitor module, QoS module, scaling module, and executing module. First, the monitor module uses two open-source tools, Heapster and InfluxDB, to monitor and store real-Time status of a Kubernetes cluster. Then, to guarantee QoS in the Kubernetes cluster, the QoS module presents a method to automatically decide a threshold of CPU utilization that is able to meet requirements of a specific application. Next, the scaling module provides a cluster scaling algorithm to get an ideal number of nodes in the Kubernetes cluster, which is used to allocate resources in a cluster-level allocation. Finally, according to the ideal number of nodes, the executing module adjusts the scale of the Kubernetes cluster to carry out the application. Extensive experiments in real environments show that, on average, the proposed system improves CPU utilization of a Kubernetes cluster by 28.99%.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,['1708'],25.363636363636363,0.2462,0.5066666666666667,1,0.11314984709480122,0.0581039755351682,0.335423197492163

At present, most computation offloading strategies only consider two computing resources, mobile devices and MEC servers. However, the computing power of the cloud server is much larger than that of the MEC server. Tasks with high computational complexity still need to be handed over to the cloud server for processing. This paper proposes an edge-cloud collaborative multi-Task computing unloading model that considers both latency and energy cost. Usually the model solving is transformed into a search solution in finite strategy space. In this paper, the nonlinear exponential inertia weight particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to get solution. By dynamically adjusting the inertia weight, the algorithm can make up for the convergence premature defect of the standard particle swarm optimization algorithm, and effectively avoid falling into the local optimal solution.

To prevent damage incurred by covert channels, researchers have preemptively scrutinized diverse covert channels that can be devised by an attacker. Although covert channels based on sensor data may interest an attacker because sensing operation is a key task in Internet of Things (IoT), we do not find any covert channel studies that adapted the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to sensor data except our prior study [27], where the SPRT is applied to sensor data in Android systems before an attacker's conception; however, our previous study showed limitations owing to the static nature of the SPRT parameter settings and the method of mapping sensor data to sample types for covert channel creation. To demonstrate that these limitations can be pacified, we propose a covert channel that dynamically applies the SPRT to sensor data in IoT. In our proposed covert channel, stealthy information bit 1 (resp. 0) is encoded to and decoded from a sequence of sensor data when the SPRT with dynamic parameter settings accepts an alternate (resp. null) hypothesis. We implement our proposed covert channel in Raspberry Pi 3 Model B devices and evaluate it in terms of various metrics. Evaluation results indicate that every encoded stealthy information byte is successfully decoded in our covert channel. Furthermore, 3.513 samples and 28.105 SPRT executions at the most are required for encoding/decoding a stealthy information byte in our devised covert channel on an average, thus resulting in fast encoding/decoding in our covert channel.

However, open-loop signal sources exhibit severe frequency fluctuation and are vulnerable to supply-induced frequency drift, phase noise, power consumption. There is a demand for precise oscillation frequency with wide tuning range and low phase noise.

It can support LTE, GSM/EDGE application with the frequency ranged from 4.39 GHz to 5.71 GHz for the local oscillator in the RF front-end circuits.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of networking amongst 16‚Äì24 year old active jobseekers living in Scotland. Design/methodology/approach: A sequential, mixed methods approach was applied to gather data, including interviews (no. of participants=7), a focus group (no. of participants=6) and a survey questionnaire (no. of participants=558). The study design was underpinned by a prominent model from the field of Information Science. As such, job search networking has been treated as an information behaviour. Findings: The findings show that young people acquire different types of information from network contacts throughout job search, and that frequent networking is associated with positive outcomes. This is especially true of engaging with family members, acquaintances and employers.

Perturbation-based heuristics have been proved to be very competitive as regards the ratio approximation accuracy/convergence speed. However, the computational burden increase with the size of the set. In this paper, we explore the idea of reducing the size of the problem by selecting a subset of representative elements, i.e. pivots, that are used to compute the approximate median instead of the whole set. We aim to reduce the computation time through a reduction of the problem size while achieving similar approximation accuracy. We explain how we find those pivots and how to compute the median string from them.

The existing text steganography methods still have a low steganographic capacity, some syntactic or semantic ambiguity problems to some extent. We propose an electronic lattice construction method based on a padding game to hide a secret message. This method first computes the length of a secret message and a key is worked out based on the length; the walking rule, the constraints to a hidden path, the initial size of a grid and the starting cell are determined based on the key and a unique hidden path can be figured out for the given secret; then the secret message is stored in the cells along the unique path and all the remaining cells in the grid are filled according to the padding game rules, which helps to obscure that secret message; finally, elements in some cells are removed to get the crossword that will be shared with the receiver. To extract the message, the receiver fills the crossword according to the same game rules as the sender does, and calculates that unique hidden path based on the shared key. The experimental results and analyses show that its concealment is prominent, its steganography success rate is 100%, and it has a high steganographic capacity. It also has no readability issue as the steganography by generation usually does.",60030434,Qingdao University,Qingdao,China,['1700'],33.285714285714285,-0.026290322580645148,0.5693010752688172,1,0.12549019607843137,0.0,0.20392156862745098

This paper proposes a new approach to improve the clients' QoE by using network awareness models as a way to forecast the number of future video content chunks to be cached. Once cached, these chunks become closer to the client, which mitigates the consequences of suboptimal network performance on bitrate-adaptive HTTP video streaming. Two prefetching approaches are proposed: an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) through a weighted function on the measured quality of service metrics, and a Neural Network to estimate and maximize the user experience without the normal service delivery degradation. Our evaluation shows that AHP provides a suboptimal behavior under constrained bandwidth, while a neural network model is able to infer network behavior and predict an optimized MOS, allowing it to better optimize the caching system and the required prefetching to adequately improve QoE.",60024825,Universidade de Aveiro,Aveiro,Portugal,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",39.8,0.17996632996632994,0.5347643097643098,1,0.13973799126637554,0.05240174672489083,0.3542600896860987

Further, a framework is developed for deriving the diversity order (DO) for each configuration. Results show that when both destination node (DN) and source node (SN) are immobile, system performance does not encounter asymptotic error floor although relay node (RN) is mobile. Although with mobile RN, the movement of either the DN or the SN critically affects system performance by asymptotic error floors.

The input to our algorithm are two or more 3-manifolds, immersed into R3 and discretized as tetrahedral meshes with shared connectivity. The output is a continuum of shapes that naturally blends the input shapes, while striving to preserve the geometric character of the input. The basis of our approach relies on the fact that the space of metrics with bounded isometric and angular distortion is convex [Chien et al. 2016b]. We show that for high dimensional manifolds, the bounded distortion metrics form a positive semidefinite cone product space. Our method can be seen as a generalization of the bounded distortion interpolation technique of [Chen et al. 2013] from planar shapes immersed in R2 to solids in R3. The convexity of the space implies that a linear blend of the (squared) edge lengths of the input tetrahedral meshes is a simple yet powerful-and-natural choice. Linearly blending flat metrics results in a new metric which is, in general, not flat, and cannot be immersed into three-dimensional space. Nonetheless, the amount of curvature that is introduced in the process tends to be very low in practical settings. We further design an extremely robust nonconvex optimization procedure that efficiently flattens the metric. The flattening procedure strives to preserve the low distortion exhibited in the blended metric while guaranteeing the validity of the metric, resulting in a locally injective map with bounded distortion.

There exist multiple factors that cause stragglers, either from the hardware resource layer or application layer, e.g. hardware heterogeneity, interference, data locality and data skew. While state-of-The-Art straggler mitigation techniques have presented partial solutions on data skew and data locality, we find that the other factors can also result in serious problems. We present Clio, a cross-layer interference-Aware optimization system that can effectively mitigate stragglers for data processing frameworks. Clio supports the scheduling of both map and reduce tasks. It heuristically dispatches intermediate data in proportion to the actual computing ability of each worker node, which is estimated considering various straggler factors, to balance the completion times of tasks in a much finer way.

1271,1304,1304,A potato salad with a lemon twist: Using a supply-side shock to study the impact of opportunistic behavior on crowdfunding platforms," All rights reserved.Crowdfunding platforms are peer-to-peer two-sided markets that enable amateur entrepreneurs to raise money online for their ventures. However, in allowing practically anyone to enter, such platforms enable opportunistic suppliers to flood the market with offerings, many of which are of low quality. This situation creates choice overload for potential backers and may thus influence their investment decisions. To empirically study the implications of this phenomenon for crowdfunding performance, we use a quasi-natural experiment in the form of an exogenous media shock that occurred on Kickstarter.com. The shock was followed by a sharp increase in the number of campaigns, particularly low-quality ones, offered on the supply side of the market; no such increase was observed on the demand side of the market. These unique conditions enable us to estimate how crowdfunding platforms are affected by the presence of an atypically large number of low-quality campaigns, while controlling for fluctuations in demand. We use two identification strategies, which enable us to control for changes in quality, to show that an increase in low-quality supply significantly decreases the performance of the average crowdfunding campaign, manifested in a lower likelihood of success (reaching funding goals) and less money raised per campaign. We also offer a new measure to estimate campaign quality and study the moderating role of campaign quality in the observed effects. We find that high-quality campaigns are less affected than low-quality campaigns by the influx of low-quality offerings.

1274,1308,1308,Lhc: A low-power heterogeneous computing method on neural network accelerator,"Accelerators can achieve high performance and low energy consumption in training or inference of neural networks. If the Non-Neural Network (Non-NN) algorithms with large amount of computation could make full use of the accelerators, it is possible to speed up its implementation, reduce energy consumption, and achieve load balancing, especially on mobile devices equipped with accelerators. However, accelerators are dedicated to neural network calculations, so that other Non-NN algorithms have difficulty in using their advantages. Furthermore, many hardware-specific restrictions have become the obstacles, such as constrained precision of operands and limited computation scale. In this paper, we propose a method named Low-power Heterogeneous Computing (LHC) to bridge the gap between Non-NN algorithms and NN accelerators. Firstly, we analyze the general principle of the accelerator and reveal the calculation model of the accelerator. To hide the details of the underlying neural network library, we extract some operators from the limited number of types of neural network computation they support. We encapsulate the low-level library, extract operators suitable for general algorithms, and implement some more advanced operators that can adapt to the constrained hardware conditions. These operators could facilitate programmers to implement some Non-NN algorithms. In the aspect of the algorithm, we extract the computationally intensive parts of the Non-NN algorithm and deploy these computational tasks on the accelerator by calling the operators. To verify our method, we implement three Non-NN algorithms by using operators and adjusting these algorithms, include Grid-based Motions Statistics, k-Nearest Neighbors, and k-Means, on a specific accelerator, Cambricon-1A. The experimental results show that the energy consumption of calculation is reduced by up to 5.4x, compared with the CPU baseline.

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a main concept in the future of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) since they provide an increase in safety and road efficiency. One of the most critical aspects of managing AVs is their behavior in proximity of intersections. Several research centers are developing algorithms to solve the intersections management, trying to avoid collisions and traffic congestion. As well as, given that many of these interactions transmit sensitive data such as identification, position, and speed of the vehicle, a high level of security and privacy insurance is a prerequisite for broad acceptation of these communication systems. In this paper, in order to address the issues those issues we propose a system that combines blockchain technology effectively to support the communication and the transaction between vehicles.

However, both the performance and the cost of the whole system are still an obstacle for a wide spread of this technology. In this article, a hybrid photovoltaic (PV)-thermoelectric generator (TEG) is investigated for pumping applications. The electric drivetrain comprises a synchronous reluctance motor and an inverter. A control strategy for the drivetrain is employed to execute two main tasks: 1) driving the motor properly to achieve a maximum torque per Amp√®re condition and 2) maximizing the output power of the PV system at different weather conditions. This means that the conventional DC-DC converter is not used in the proposed system. Moreover, batteries, which are characterized by short life expectancy and high replacement cost, are also not used. It is found that the motor output power and the pump flow rate are increased by about 9.5% and 12% respectively when the hybrid PV-TEG array is used compared to only using PV array.

With the emergence of edge computing, more edge devices with large storages are available, which is a good opportunity for new caching design. To this end, we propose a novel Edge-oriented Collaborative Caching (ECC) in ICN. In ECC, edge devices (such as edge server, micro datacenter, etc.) cache contents while routers only maintain cache indexes which are used to redirect subsequent requests towards the cached content. This enables ECC to work in a lightweight and collaborative fashion. We propose an optimization method to properly create cache indexes, considering both content popularity and cache benefit.

All rights reserved.Clustering is a fundamental task in data mining technique which puts more similar data objects into one group and dissimilar objects into another group. The aim of this paper is to compare the quality of clusters produced by K-Means, Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) for data clustering. The k-means algorithm is the most widely used partitional clustering algorithm technique in the industries and academia. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement. The main drawback of the K-Means algorithm is that it is sensitive to the selection of the initial cluster centers and it may converge to local optima. Fuzzy C-means algorithm is a popular algorithm in the field of fuzzy clustering. Fuzzy clustering using FCM can provide a data partition that is both better and more meaningful than hard clustering approaches. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary computational technique which was motivated by the organism‚Äôs behavior such as schooling of fish and flocking of birds.

However, the speed of a task cannot be controlled arbitrarily on a general processor, making it impossible to implement fluid scheduling directly. Therefore, there have been many studies on pseudo fluid scheduling where the algorithm is based on repeat task execution which speed is constant in an interval. We apply the special mechanisms of Responsive MultiThreaded Processor (RMTP) to the novel control mechanism in order to implement fluid scheduling directly.

In these scenarios, light fields offer much richer cues that can be used efficiently to drastically improve the quality and robustness of segmentations. In this paper we introduce a new light field segmentation method that respects texture appearance, depth consistency, as well as occlusion, and creates well-shaped segments that are robust under view point changes. Furthermore, our segmentation is hierarchical, i.e. with a single optimization, a whole hierarchy of segmentations with different numbers of regions is available. All this is achieved with a submodular objective function that allows for efficient greedy optimization. Finally, we introduce a new tree-array type data structure, i.e. a disjoint tree, to efficiently perform submodular optimization on very large graphs. Tis approach is of interest beyond our specific application of light field segmentation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a number of synthetic and real data sets, and show how the obtained segmentations can be used for applications in image processing and graphics.",60092945,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology,Jeddah,Saudi Arabia,['1704'],18.0,0.12863046044864224,0.5063114915387643,1,0.08849557522123894,0.004424778761061947,0.29910714285714285
1294,1328,1328,An Adaptive Use Strategy for Solid-State Lasers by Combining Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Model Predictive Control,"Solid-state lasers are widely applied in various fields, such as material processing, laser marking, and remote sensing. Long lifetime is always required for commercial solid-state lasers in practice. Thus, it is of great importance to carefully design the use strategy in order to efficiently utilize the available resources and prolong the lifespan of solid-state lasers. In this paper, the use strategy is investigated with the consideration of the performance degradation of solid-state lasers, for the general case that the values of the model parameters are all unknown. First, the degradation behavior of solid-state lasers is modeled on the basis of the Wiener process by taking into account normally distributed measurement errors. Then, an adaptive use strategy is proposed by combining maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with model predictive control (MPC). The aim of the proposed use strategy is to maintain the actual output optical power of a solid-state laser at a stable and acceptable level by adaptively adjusting the input electrical power. Specifically, the estimates of the model parameters are updated based on the measured output optical powers up to the current time by applying MLE, and the input electrical power is optimized based on MPC. Finally, a numerical example is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed use strategy.",60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,['1700'],23.33333333333333,0.07500000000000001,0.4833333333333333,1,0.08943089430894309,0.02032520325203252,0.2948717948717949

Water-based mass transfer is resolved through the porous mixture, gas represents carbon dioxide produced by leavening agents in the baking process and dough is modeled as a viscoelastoplastic solid to represent its varied and complex rheological properties. Water content in the mixture reduces during the baking process according to Fick's Law which contributes to drying and cracking of crust at the material boundary. Carbon dioxide gas produced by leavening agents during baking creates internal pressure that causes rising.

In this study, a comparative study of the AC surface flashover properties of the novel 3-element mixed oil-cellulose insulation pressboard (3EMO-IP) and mineral oil-cellulose insulation pressboard (MO-IP) was performed under needle-plate and finger-finger electrode, respectively, measurement including dielectric property, surface flashover voltage, damage of cellulose pressboard surface and the gas generation behaviors after multiple surface flashover. Results show that the cellulose insulation pressboard immersed in the novel 3-element mixed insulation oil (3EMO) has higher relative permittivity and dielectric loss factor at 50 Hz, and also has slightly lower surface resistivity. The AC surface flashover voltage of the 3EMO-IP is higher than that of MO-IP under needle-plate and finger-finger electrode (electrode distance 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm). Compared to MO-IP, the lower electric field intensity at the oil-pressboard interface, as well as more difficult for surface charge accumulation of 3EMO-IP and the higher breakdown voltage of 3EMO lead to the higher AC surface flashover voltage of 3EMO-IP. Moreover, the carbonization of fibers in 3EMO-IP is slightly less.

1305,1339,1339,Efficient Training Support Vector Clustering with Appropriate Boundary Information,"Due to the remarkable capability in handling arbitrary cluster shapes, support vector clustering (SVC) benefits data analysis in terms of data description. However, large-scale data such as network traffic frequently makes it suffer from highly intensive pricey computation and storage for solving the dual problem and storing the kernel matrix, respectively. Fortunately, support vectors which describe the clusters, in a sense, are expected in the boundaries. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient training SVC with appropriate boundary information (ETSVC), which features excellent flexibility and scalability. In ETSVC, we first give a shrinkable boundary selection (SBS) method which collects appropriate boundaries while reducing redundancy and noise. Based on the boundary information, a redefined dual problem is then designed without scarifying the principle of SVC. Finally, we design a reformative solver (RSolver) to reformulate the training phase, which estimates the support vector function by solving the dual problem. Since only a subset of boundaries is employed for model training, theoretical analysis suggests that ETSVC reaches efficiency improvement and consumes much less memory if sacrificing efficiency to reduce storage consumption. Towards grouping P2P flows and large-scale intrusion traffic, as well as other non-traffic data, experimental results confirm that ETSVC could be applied to resources constrained platform while achieving comparable accuracies with the state-of-the-art methods.",60025578,Xidian University,Xi'an,China,['1700'],23.66666666666667,0.17462962962962966,0.5244444444444444,1,0.12840466926070038,0.01556420233463035,0.34285714285714286

Previous methods either are specifically designed for shape synthesis or focus on texture transfer.

To achieve this goal, we first disentangle the representations for content and style by using two encoders, ensuring the multi-content and multi-style generation. Then we utilize two collaboratively working decoders to generate the glyph shape image and its texture image simultaneously. In addition, we introduce a local texture refinement loss to further improve the quality of the synthesized textures. In this manner, our one-stage model is much more efficient and effective than other multi-stage stacked methods. We also propose a large-scale dataset with Chinese glyph images in various shape and texture styles, rendered from 35 professional-designed artistic fonts with 7,326 characters and 2,460 synthetic artistic fonts with 639 characters, to validate the effectiveness and extendability of our method.

However, the lower one is moving with a variable velocity to instigate centripetal forces and forced convection accompanied by Coriolis with the fluid's rotation.

The behavior of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is analyzed between two rotating plates. The rotation of the fluid causes the lower plate to move with variable velocity thus producing forced convection with Coriolis and centripetal impact, nevertheless, the upper plate is porous. The well-suited transformations are employed to obtain the dimensionless governing equations' system. Thermo-physical characteristics of the ethylene-glycol and CNTs of both types are utilized to accomplish the numerical solution by MATLAB's function bvp4c.

1314,1348,1348,Cost-effective signal map crowdsourcing with auto-encoder based active matrix completion,"Signal map is of great importance, especially in the dawn of 5G network, for site spectrum monitoring, location-based services (LBS), network construction, and cellular planning. Despite its significance, the traditional signal map construction, e.g., through full site survey, could be time-consuming and labor-intensive as the signal varies frequently over time and the accuracy requirement grows rapidly with the emergence of new applications. Even with crowdsourcing scheme, the participants tend to be unevenly distributed in space while the encouragement budgets for the participants could be far from enough to collect adequate high-quality measurements. Therefore, the signal map constructed by crowdsourcing is often sparse and incomplete. To this end, in this paper, we study how to effectively reconstruct and update the signal map in the case of partially measured signal maps with minimum cost and propose an auto-encoder-based active signal map reconstruction method (AER). Our method is mainly innovative in three parts. Firstly, AER can effectively update the signal map with only a small number of observations while also fully using the incomplete historical signals to effectively update the signal map online. Secondly, AER consists of an active query mechanism which quantitatively evaluates the most valuable measurement site for reconstruction, which further reduces the measurement cost to a large extent. Thirdly, to cope with the measurement dynamics, we give a new signal map model describing not only the signal strength but also the signal dynamics, based on which an advanced AER algorithm is proposed.

1315,1349,1349,Reparameterizing discontinuous integrands for differentiable rendering,"Differentiable rendering has recently opened the door to a number of challenging inverse problems involving photorealistic images, such as computational material design and scattering-aware reconstruction of geometry and materials from photographs. Differentiable rendering algorithms strive to estimate partial derivatives of pixels in a rendered image with respect to scene parameters, which is difficult because visibility changes are inherently non-differentiable. We propose a new technique for differentiating path-traced images with respect to scene parameters that affect visibility, including the position of cameras, light sources, and vertices in triangle meshes. Our algorithm computes the gradients of illumination integrals by applying changes of variables that remove or strongly reduce the dependence of the position of discontinuities on differentiable scene parameters. The underlying parameterization is created on the fly for each integral and enables accurate gradient estimates using standard Monte Carlo sampling in conjunction with automatic differentiation. Importantly, our approach does not rely on sampling silhouette edges, which has been a bottleneck in previous work and tends to produce high-variance gradients when important edges are found with insufficient probability in scenes with complex visibility and high-resolution geometry. We show that our method only requires a few samples to produce gradients with low bias and variance for challenging cases such as glossy reflections and shadows. Finally, we use our differentiable path tracer to reconstruct the 3D geometry and materials of several real-world objects from a set of reference photographs.",60104653,Universite Grenoble Alpes,Saint Martin d'Heres,France,['1704'],29.25,0.12286501377410468,0.5880853994490359,1,0.1183206106870229,0.007633587786259542,0.328
1316,1350,1350,Direct Control Strategy of Real-Time Tracking Power Generation Plan for Wind Power and Battery Energy Storage Combined System,"To improve the overall economy of the wind-energy storage power station, a direct control strategy is proposed to track the deviation of the wind power plan. Compared with the traditional strategy of wind power fluctuation mitigation, the control strategy in this paper can change the charge and discharge power of energy storage in real-time according to the deviation of wind power and the state of charge (SOC). When the power of wind power changes suddenly, the strategy can make the valid judgment and prevent control failure, so that Grid-connected power of wind farm in extreme cases can also meet the requirements of the safe and stable operation of the power system. The strategy uses the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to analyze the power deviation of the wind farm in the frequency domain and obtains power compensation requirements for different time scales. Energy storage equipment with corresponding characteristics is used to classify control of deviation of wind power. The compensated power deviation can meet the requirements in market competition. At the same time, the power exchange between storage systems is carried out to optimize the state of charge in real-time and make the energy-type energy storage in shallow charge/discharge state, which effectively reduces the repeated regulation of energy storage systems. Finally, this paper establishes a comprehensive economic benefit model of the energy storage system. Combining the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) and backward scenario reduction technology generate multiple scenarios. The calculation results show that the proposed strategy can effectively track the deviation of the wind power plan. Furthermore, prolong the service life of the energy storage system and improve the market competitiveness of wind power.",60030270,Guangxi University,Nanning,China,['1700'],25.0,0.08166666666666668,0.4983333333333333,1,0.11538461538461539,0.028846153846153848,0.21333333333333335
1317,1351,1351,Integral formulations of volumetric transmitance,"Computing the light attenuation between two given points is an essential yet expensive task in volumetric light transport simulation. Existing unbiased transmittance estimators are all based on ""null-scattering"" random walks enabled by augmenting the media with fictitious matter. This formulation prevents the use of traditional Monte Carlo estimator variance analysis, thus the efficiency of such methods is understood from a mostly empirical perspective. In this paper, we present several novel integral formulations of volumetric transmittance in which existing estimators arise as direct Monte Carlo estimators. Breaking from physical intuition, we show that the null-scattering concept is not strictly required for unbiased transmittance estimation, but is a form of control variates for effectively reducing variance. Our formulations bring new insight into the problem and the efficiency of existing estimators. They also provide a framework for devising new types of transmittance estimators with distinct and complementary performance tradeoffs, as well as a clear recipe for applying sample stratification.",60025272,University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,['1704'],22.285714285714285,0.07486631016042783,0.422663610898905,1,0.1206896551724138,0.028735632183908046,0.27058823529411763

Previous work on the use of ADA receivers for visible light communication (VLC) analyzes only REs with round apertures and photodiodes with a limited range of parameters. This paper extends the analysis to calculate the channel gains for REs with for both round and square apertures and PDs and for more parameters. Graphs show how the gain varies as a function of the relative orientation of the transmitter and receiver for ten different designs. It is shown that the directionality of an RE depends on the offset of the PD from the aperture and that the field of view depends on the distance between the aperture and the PD. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive simulation results demonstrate the bit error rate (BER) performance of receivers based on these ten designs in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) VLC application.

1325,1359,1359,"The influence of a network's spatial symmetry, topological dimension, and density on its percolation threshold","Analyses of the processes of information transfer within network structures shows that the conductivity and percolation threshold of the network depend not only on its density (average number of links per node), but also on its spatial symmetry groups and topological dimension. The results presented in this paper regarding conductivity simulation in network structures show that, for regular and random 2D and 3D networks, an increase in the number of links (density) per node reduces their percolation threshold value. At the same network density, the percolation threshold value is less for 3D than for 2D networks, whatever their structure and symmetry may be. Regardless of the type of networks and their symmetry, transition from 2D to 3D structures engenders a change of percolation threshold by a value exp-(d-1) that is invariant for transition between structures, for any kind of network (d being topological dimension). It is observed that in 2D or 3D networks, which can be mutually transformed by deformation without breaking and forming new links, symmetry of similarity is observed, and the networks have the same percolation threshold. The presence of symmetry axes and corresponding number of symmetry planes in which they lie affects the percolation threshold value. For transition between orders of symmetry axes, in the presence of the corresponding planes of symmetry, an invariant exists which contributes to the percolation threshold value. Inversion centers also influence the value of the percolation threshold. Moreover, the greater the number of pairs of elements of the structure which have inversion, the more they contribute to the fraction of the percolation threshold in the presence of such a center of symmetry. However, if the center of symmetry lies in the plane of mirror symmetry separating the layers of the 3D structure, the mutual presence of this group of symmetry elements do not affect the percolation threshold value. The scientific novelty of the obtained results is that for different network structures, it was shown that the percolation threshold for the blocking of nodes problem could be represented as an additive set of invariant values, that is, as an algebraic sum, the value of the members of which is stored in the transition from one structure to another. The invariant values are network density, topological dimension, and some of the elements of symmetry (axes of symmetry and the corresponding number of symmetry planes in which they lie, centers of inversion).",60096204,MIREA - Russian Technological University (RTU MIREA),Moscow,Russian Federation,['1701'],33.083333333333336,0.04797979797979798,0.3965423465423465,1,0.06802721088435375,0.015873015873015872,0.23927765237020315

Compared with traditional video-on-demand (VOD) services, live video streaming has much higher requirements on Quality-of-Experience (QoE), including low rebuffering, high definition, low latency and low bitrate oscillations. While previous adaptive bitrate algorithms (ABR) solely optimize bitrate for ensuring QoE of VOD, live video streaming has a larger decision space, making the optimization problem more difficult to solve. We propose Deeplive, which maximizes QoE through deep reinforcement learning (DRL), so it does not rely on fixed rules. To accelerate the training process of Deeplive, we further propose optimization including window completion with historical data and quick-start with rate-based algorithm. We compare Deeplive with other advanced ABR algorithms in a frame-level dynamic adaptive video streaming simulator using different network traces, QoE definitions, and video categories.

1334,1368,1368,OctopusKing: A TCT-Aware task scheduling on spark platform,"The majority of large-scale data intensive applications executed by data centers are based on Map-Reduce or its open-source implementation, Spark. However, the native Spark's data locality has significant side effects. Spark prioritizes high-priority tasks. But tasks at the next level of data locality are never started because Spark's delay scheduling mechanism. Additionally, the current scheduling approach on Spark only considers allocating reasonably computing resources for each task, but ignores the balance between computing resources and network resources. Network-intensive jobs will generate a large number of cross-rack tasks on heterogeneous clusters. More extensively, geographically distributed big data analytics clusters will produce greater network latency due to network transfer, which will decrease the performance of the whole cluster. Therefore, we propose OctopusKing a scheduling optimization approach based on the task completion time awareness. OctopusKing employs a deep learning algorithm to predict task completion time(TCT), which comprehensively considers four influence factors including the data size of each task, data nodes heterogeneity, the computation complexity of each task and network transfers. Based on the prediction of task completion time, our approach balances non-local task scheduling and network transfer time, which decreases the overall computation time of a job and improves the utilization of cluster resources effectively. Finally, we have implemented OctopusKing on Spark cluster with a 10 nodes.

1338,1372,1372,Ec4: Ecn and credit-reservation converged congestion control,"Bursty traffic and thousands of concurrent flows incur inevitable congestion in data center networks (DCNs) and then affect the overall performance. Various transport protocols are developed to mitigate the network congestion, including reactive and proactive protocols. Reactive schemes to handling congestion after congestion arises are common to current DCNs. However, with the growth of scale and link speed, reactive schemes such as DCTCP encounter the significant problem of slow responding to congestion. On the contrary, proactive protocols are designed to avoid congestion, and they have the advantages of zero data loss, fast convergence and low bu er occupancy (e.g., credit-reservation protocols). But in actual deployment scenario, it is hard to guarantee one protocol to be deployed in every server at one time. When credit-reservation protocol is deployed to DCNs step-by-step, the network is converted to multi-protocol state and faces the following fundamental challenges: (i) unfairness, (ii) high bu er occupancy, and (iii) heavy tail delay. Therefore, we propose EC4, which is for converging ECN-based and credit-reservation protocols with minimal modification. To the best of our knowledge, EC4 is the first to address how to harmonize proactive and reactive congestion control. Targeting the common ECN-based protocol-DCTCP, EC4 leverages the Forward Explicit Congestion Notification (FECN) to deliver realtime congestion information and redefines feedback control. After evaluation, the results show that EC4 e ectively addresses the unfair link allocation.

In the Philippines, The national e-government initiatives continue to progress. However, there is a lack of empirical studies on the local e-governments level. Thus, in order to determine the country's current local e-government development, this paper examined the maturity level of websites in the municipal and city governments in the country and identified the issues associated with its e-government development. Using the United Nation (UN) e-government maturity model, 150 local government websites were assessed based on the model's online service component. Through a stratified sampling method, the population was divided into sub-groups based on income classifications of municipalities and type of cities. Interviews were also conducted to key informants from local offices to determine possible issues associated with e-government development. The results show that several of the local governments are still on a basic (emerging) stage. The highly urbanized cities, on the other hand, showed that most of their websites are already on stage two (enhanced), in which it can accommodate simple one-way communication services. Moreover, among the reasons behind the lag of e-Government progress are the lack of technological infrastructure and skills, organizational issues and lack of government regulations among others.

1343,1377,1377,GradNet: Unsupervised deep screened poisson reconstruction for gradient-domain rendering,"Monte Carlo (MC) methods for light transport simulation are flexible and general but typically suffer from high variance and slow convergence. Gradientdomain rendering alleviates this problem by additionally generating image gradients and reformulating rendering as a screened Poisson image reconstruction problem. To improve the quality and performance of the reconstruction, we propose a novel and practical deep learning based approach in this paper. The core of our approach is a multi-branch auto-encoder, termed GradNet, which end-to-end learns a mapping from a noisy input image and its corresponding image gradients to a high-quality image with low variance. Once trained, our network is fast to evaluate and does not require manual parameter tweaking. Due to the difficulty in preparing ground-truth images for training, we design and train our network in a completely unsupervised manner by learning directly from the input data. This is the first solution incorporating unsupervised deep learning into the gradient-domain rendering framework. The loss function is defined as an energy function including a data fidelity term and a gradient fidelity term. To further reduce the noise of the reconstructed image, the loss function is reinforced by adding a regularizer constructed from selected rendering-specific features.

1344,1378,1378,SVMDF: A Secure Virtual Machine Deployment Framework to Mitigate Co-Resident Threat in Cloud,"Recent studies have shown that co-resident attacks have aroused great security threat in cloud. Since hardware is shared among different tenants, malicious tenants can launch various co-resident attacks, such as side channel attacks, covert channel attacks and resource interference attacks. Existing countermeasures have their limitations and can not provide comprehensive defense against co-resident attacks. This paper combines the advantages of various countermeasures and proposes a complete co-resident threat defense solution which consists of co-resident-resistant VM allocation (CRRVA), analytic hierarchy process-based threat score mechanism (AHPTSM) and attack-aware VM reallocation (AAVR). CRRVA securely allocates VMs and also takes load balance and power consumption into consideration to make the allocation policy more practical. According to the intrinsic characteristics of co-resident attacks, AHPTSM evaluates VM's threat score which denotes the probability that a VM is suffering or conducting co-resident attacks based on analytic hierarchy process. And AAVR further migrates VMs with extremely high threat scores and separates VM pairs which are likely to be malicious to each other. Extensive experiments in CloudSim have shown that CRRVA can greatly reduce the allocation co-resident threat as well as balancing the load for both CSPs and tenants with little impact on power consumption. In addition, guided by threat score distribution, AAVR can effectively guarantee runtime co-resident security by migrating high threat score VMs with less migration cost.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",24.444444444444446,0.1570416666666667,0.53025,1,0.11610486891385768,0.052434456928838954,0.3868312757201646

Real-time feedback is presented on the computer screen to enhance collaborative participation in the human-computer interaction. Methods: Four stimulus sources flickering at different frequencies were sequentially fixed around the computer monitor to allow for subjects to complete control tasks by gazing at different stimulus sources. The subjects autonomously switched between the idle and working states by controlling the alpha amplitude. A sliding window voting discrimination (SWVD) strategy was incorporated into the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) algorithm for asynchronous classification. Results: Experiments were performed with 18 subjects using both the synchronous and asynchronous paradigms. The average accuracy was 95.42¬±3.35% with a data length of 3 s for synchronous operation; in addition, most subjects were able to successfully control a target to move precisely and smoothly with a 1 s sliding window during asynchronous operation. Conclusion: The proposed design scheme is feasible for our online asynchronous BCI system.

In order to address this issue, model-free localization techniques using deep learning frameworks have been lately proposed, where mainly classification methods were applied. In this paper, instead of classification based mechanism, we propose a logistic regression based scheme with the deep learning framework, combined with Cram√©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) assisted robust training, which achieves more robust sub-meter level accuracy (0.97m median distance error) in the standard laboratory environment and maintains reasonable online prediction overhead under the single WiFi AP settings.",60028900,National and Kapodistrian University of Athens,Athens,Greece,['1700'],32.6,0.07136904761904761,0.4852380952380952,1,0.10144927536231885,0.05314009661835749,0.3829787234042553

In this work, we devise a contactless but accurate object tracking system on desktop with commercial RFIDs. Comparing with conventional vision or acoustic based solutions, our system needs less computational resources and could be mucheasier for deployment. Moreover, ours could record the true positions for each device instead of the relative positions delivered in most of the previous studies. To this end, recording the user's access to the object on the desktop allows the user to interact with the smart device with simple actions. We present RFdesk, a contactless object location system that accurately locates every objects on the desktop. However, compare to tracking object withcontacted tag, several challenges are tackled before we make the system work. First of all, the signal employed for contactless tracking gets reflected twice which is thus much weaker, making the signal more susceptible to environmental noise and multipath. Another well-known challenge for contactless tracking is multi-Target tracking as the signals reflected from multiple targets get mixed and interact. Extensive experiments show that RFdesk canflexibly deploy devices and tags, antennas, and localization itemscan be deployed on different planes. A median error of 3cm can be achieved for target tracking without attaching tags to the targets, even if there are 4 positioning objects on the desktop.

It depends on trust and cognitive perspectives,"The rapid growth of mobile payment as the part of Financial Technology (FinTech) could lead to empirical problems (e.g. hacker attacks, privacy violation, etc) that results low cognitive based trust and lower loyalty among users. Hence, there are some proclivities for users' continuance intention on trust and its cognitive perspective regarding their funds that has been transferred to mobile payment platform. In order to understand the proclivity, we collect primary data from 165 users of mobile payment platform in Jakarta Indonesia and develop the hypotheses regarding the continuance intention that depends on trust and cognitive perspectives. To test the hypotheses, this study employs Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings show that the cognitive based trust dimensions such as information quality and privacy are insignificant on continuance intention. On the other hand, perceived security protection shows positive influence. Simultaneously, only information quality and security protection have significantly and positive influence on trust, while privacy perception are insignificant on trust and continuance intention. This study also shows that trust has more determining role toward continuance intention than the cognitive perspective. This study contributes in specifying cognitive dimension and trust on continuance intention. Therefore, it suggests the mobile payment companies to improve quality, reliability, and information updates. Furthermore, they also need to improve the security protection that refers to personalization among users of the mobile payment to gain more trust and achieve customers' retention.",60122670,Universitas Agung Podomoro,West Jakarta,Indonesia,['1700'],19.58333333333333,0.1288961038961039,0.4600649350649351,1,0.1044776119402985,0.05970149253731343,0.31086142322097376

A critical but difficult issue for the service and network providers is deciding where to instantiate a list of virtual network functions (VNFs), namely VNF placement problem. In this paper, we investigate the VNF placement, for the purpose of resource and network traffic consumption minimization. Moreover, we consider the arrival rates of users' requests for different types of service function chains (SFCs). This allows the placement scheme to adapt to users' time-varying requests and improve the network resource utilization. Then we formulate the VNF placement problem as a jointly constrained optimization problem. Afterwards, we propose an approach called joint optimization resource and traffic consumption (JORTC) with enhanced biogeography-based (EBBO) optimization algorithm to resolve the VNF placement problem.

While the creators generally have spent large efforts in modeling the visually appealing shapes with both large scale structures and intricate details, a majority of the meshes are unfortunately flawed in terms of having duplicate faces, mis-oriented regions, disconnected patches, etc., due to multiple factors involving both human errors and software inconsistencies. All these artifacts have severely limited the possible low-level and high-level processing tasks that can be applied to the rich datasets. In this work, we present a novel approach to fix these man-made meshes such that the outputs are guaranteed to be oriented manifold meshes that preserve the original structures, big and small, as much as possible. Our key observation is that the models all visually look meaningful, which leads to our strategy of repairing the flaws while always preserving the visual quality. We apply local refinements and removals only where necessary to achieve minimal intrusion of the original meshes, and global adjustments through robust optimization to ensure the outputs are valid manifold meshes with optimal connections. We test the approach on large-scale 3D datasets, and obtain quality meshes that are more readily usable for further geometry processing tasks.",60098464,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,China,['1704'],29.57142857142857,0.060504201680672276,0.4198529411764706,1,0.11864406779661017,0.00847457627118644,0.36444444444444446
1354,1388,1388,A Case Study of Association Instability in Dense IEEE 802.11 Networks,"Association instability is a common phenomenon in dense networks. The decision of whether or not to perform a handoff between access points in an infrastructured IEEE 802.11 network is taken exclusively by the wireless client stations. Even without mobility, static client devices may decide to migrate to another access point with the goal of improving performance. However, the criteria used to perform handoffs are not defined by the IEEE 802.11 standard and, thus, are dependent on specific vendor implementations. In this paper, we use data from a real large scale network and run experiments to demonstrate that such implementations are commonly deficient, resulting in high levels of association instability in dense environments. By analyzing the implementation used by the most common devices, we were able to conclude that this instability, known as the 'ping-pong effect', results from the direct usage of RSSI samples which are highly variable. Finally, we analyze the behavior of RSSI in indoor environments showing that its time series presents multimodal distribution. We argue that the findings presented in this study can help develop more stable handoff algorithms for dense wireless networks.",60001865,Universidade Federal Fluminense,Niteroi,Brazil,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",23.125,0.11609523809523807,0.5315238095238095,1,0.12077294685990338,0.024154589371980676,0.27450980392156865
1355,1389,1389,A hierarchical futures data analysis framework for multiple accounts detection,"In futures markets, participators are required to report their Multiple Accounts (MAs) to the market supervisors. However, a small portion of traders tent to use MA to extend their position limit or even manipulate the market prices. To detect these traders, a systematic approach have to be developed to automatically assess the behaviour similarity of each account pair. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Futures Data Analysis framework (HierFDA) with multiple data processing components and an unsupervised machine learning model to detect MAs. Since we aim to investigate the whole market with millions of accounts, HierFDA is designed to be memory-efficient and can be easily parallelized. It consists of two layers of components to filter out the pairs of accounts with different levels of similarities. As most of the market participators are 'regular' individuals and only a tiny portion of the accounts are MA, we apply a deep auto encoder for unsupervised anomaly detection to identify the accounts with extremely high trading similarities. By training with sufficient samples which are not previously identified as MA, the deep neural network can automatically balance the importance of the similarity features on the results. The offline test results show that HierFDA has superior robustness to the sample noise. And we also deploy HierFDA to the production environment of Dalian Commodity Exchange.

Therefore, we proposed the aggregation of Network Interface Cards (NICs) in a ready-to-use integration with the OpenNebula cloud manager using Linux containers. We perform a set of experiments using a network microbenchmark to get specific network performance metrics and NAS parallel benchmarks to analyze the performance impact on HPC applications. Our results highlight that the implementation of NIC aggregation improves network performance in terms of throughput and latency.

To deal with this, fog computing was proposed in order to provide closer computing services in a distributed manner, acting as a middle layer between IoT devices and the cloud. However, these devices have low energy and low computational power. Therefore, strategies to distribute requested services, bundled in a set of applications, are of particular interest. Furthermore, these applications have deadlines that may be short, which have to be met. Hence, models and algorithms are needed to place the requested services in order to meet the deadlines while using the fog as distributed as possible. In this paper, we present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation with two main objectives: maximize the fog usage and maximize the fairness throughout the system (fog and cloud).

This paper proposes Peeking at the Past and Present Routing (P3R), a routing protocol that will calculate next-hops when the past forwarding is considered invalid. The next-hop calculation is based on the predicted locations of forwarder's neighbors and the packet's destination node, overcoming the inaccuracy caused by stale location information. Furthermore, we differentiate vehicles on crossroads as they have high connectivity in actual urban streets. In this way, P3R is able to deal with link breakages quickly and exploit new links.

Predictive maintenance aims to minimize the downtime due to maintenance of machinery, while simultaneously minimizing the risk of unforeseen failures. This paper proposes a method to aid industries to make maintenance scheduling decisions that can be adopted in a distributed factory environment. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) approach is used to determine the optimal time for maintenance for a machine. We first put forward an offline method for learning the Markov model parameters using historical sensor data. To allow for continual learning, an algorithm based on particle filters is proposed to provide online estimation of parameters of a Partially Observable MDP model. The particle filter algorithm allows the framework to adapt uniquely to each machine. The relative benefits of the POMDP model over a standard MDP model in the presence of noisy sensor data are evaluated through simulations which show significant improvements in revenue and reduced downtime.

In accordance with the Law No. 4 of 2009 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining in increasing the added value of nickel ore, it is necessary to process and refine nickel ore. One of the nickel ore processing/refining technologies is through Pyrometallurgy technique. Pyrometallurgy technique involves high temperature and large energy.

1365,1399,1399,Algebraic dependencies and PSPACE algorithms in approximative complexity over any field,"Testing whether a set f of polynomials has an algebraic dependence is a basic problem with several applications. The polynomials are given as algebraic circuits. The complexity of algebraic independence testing is wide open over finite fields (Dvir, Gabizon, Wigderson, FOCS‚Äô07). Previously, the best complexity bound known was NP#P (Mittmann, Saxena, Scheiblechner, Trans. AMS 2014). In this article we put the problem in AM ‚à© coAM. In particular, dependence testing is unlikely to be NP-hard. Our proof uses methods of algebraic geometry. We estimate the size of the image and the sizes of the preimages of the polynomial map f over the finite field. A gap between the corresponding sizes for independent and for dependent sets of polynomials is utilized in the AM protocols. Next, we study the open question of testing whether every annihilator of f has zero constant term (Kayal, CCC‚Äô09). We introduce a new problem called approximate polynomial satisfiability (APS), which is equivalent to the preceding question by a classical characterization in terms of the Zariski closure of the image of f. We show that APS is NP-hard and, using ideas from algebraic geometry, we put APS in PSPACE. (The best previous bound was EXPSPACE via Gr√∂bner basis computation.) As an unexpected application of this to approximative complexity theory we obtain that, over any field, hitting sets for VP can be constructed in PSPACE.

1370,1404,1404,Latency-minimized and energy-efficient online task offloading for mobile edge computing with stochastic heterogeneous tasks,"Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising paradigm to meet the low latency requirement of applications like virtual/augmented reality, which moves computation workloads from remote cloud to network edge. Task offloading is a crucial problem in a MEC system, which significantly concerns with the achieved latency of tasks and the energy consumption on edge nodes. Although many efforts have been paid on the problem, most of them ignore the hierarchical architecture of MEC and the heterogeneity of tasks generated by different applications. In this paper, we consider a three-layer MEC system with tasks of various types stochastically arrive in real time, in which each task can be executed on mobile smart devices, offloaded to the edge server, or offloaded to the remote cloud. The task offloading problem in such a MEC system with the objective to minimize the averaged latency over time is NP-hard. To solve it, we employ Lyapunov optimization and duality theory to reformulate the problem and decompose it into a set of subproblems. Each subproblem can be distributedly solved by a mobile device or the edge server individually.

1372,1406,1406,A3CM: Automatic Capability Annotation for Android Malware,"Android malware poses serious security and privacy threats to the mobile users. Traditional malware detection and family classification technologies are becoming less effective due to the rapid evolution of the malware landscape, with the emerging of so-called zero-day-family malware families. To address this issue, our paper presents a novel research problem on automatically identifying the security/privacy-related capabilities of any detected malware, which we refer to as Malware Capability Annotation (MCA). Motivated by the observation that known and zero-day-family malware families share the security/privacy-related capabilities, MCA opens a new alternative way to effectively analyze zero-day-family malware (the malware that do not belong to any existing families) through exploring the related information and knowledge from known malware families. To address the MCA problem, we design a new MCA hunger solution, Automatic Capability Annotation for Android Malware (A3CM). A3CM works in the following four steps: 1) A3CM automatically extracts a set of semantic features such as permissions, API calls, network addresses from raw binary APKs to characterize malware samples; 2) A3CM applies a statistical embedding method to map the features into a joint feature space, so that malware samples can be represented as numerical vectors; 3) A3CM infers the malicious capabilities by using the multi-label classification model; 4) The trained multi-label model is used to annotate the malicious capabilities of the candidate malware samples. To facilitate the new research of MCA, we create a new ground truth dataset that consists of 6,899 annotated Android malware samples from 72 families. We carry out a large number of experiments based on the four representative security/privacy-related capabilities to evaluate the effectiveness of A3CM. Our results show that A3CM can achieve promising accuracy of 1.00, 0.98 and 0.63 in inferring multiple capabilities of known Android malware, small size-families' malware and zero-day-families' Android malware, respectively.",60030804,Swinburne University of Technology,Melbourne,Australia,['1700'],33.0,0.07519855144855142,0.450831252081252,1,0.12129380053908356,0.05660377358490566,0.4507462686567164

1374,1408,1408,Effect of rainfall gauges density on areal reduction factor,"Rainfall ground gauges measure the rainfall depth only at a certain physical point which is the location of the gauges. However, storm events are a natural phenomena with an intensity varying between a maximum value at storm center and decreases to zero at the storm event peripheries. To account for this variability, usually the maximum rainfall value is multiplied by a ratio ‚Äì less than unity ‚Äì termed the Areal Reduction Factor (ARF), that is usually a function of area, to reduce the design rainfall value when considering an areal average instead of a point value. As most of catchment areas have only limited rainfall gauges due to capital and running costs of these gauges, it is important to account for the number of gauges and / or the distance between stations or their areal coverage when using the ARF ratios. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relation between the number of stations in the context of an arid or semiarid watershed and identify correction factors needed to be applied for areal reduction factors calculated using limited number of gauges. Many researchers studied the areal reduction factor estimate; however, the relation between the number of gauges used in developing areal reduction factor equations and its value was not investigated. In this study, rainfall records from 90 gauges in Walnut Gulch, USA, experimental watershed were used to study the impact of the rainfall gauges density within a watershed on the value of the deduced areal reduction factor. Eight groups were selected to represent the rainfall gauges intensity, which are 3, 6, 10, 20, 40, 50, 70, and 89 gauges. For each group, 1000 samples, each with the previously mentioned number of stations, were made using the orthogonal sampling technique. For each group, the areal reduction factor was calculated and an average ARF curve is estimated. Results were compared to the ARF deduced using the full set of 90 gauges. It was found that the areal reduction factor values decrease proportionally with the increase of the rainfall gauges density. Correction factors curves were generated to be used as a function of rainfall gauges intensity.",60027423,Fayoum University,Fayoum,Egypt,"['1712', '1708', '1705', '1702']",27.30769230769231,0.03315476190476191,0.4179166666666668,1,0.09438775510204081,0.025510204081632654,0.30357142857142855

All rights reserved.Improving the efficiency of criminal procedure is among the priorities of the modern domestic legislator and executor of law. As an effective means of solving it, some experts, following the example of a number of states in the post-Soviet space, propose the introduction of the institute of special (covert) investigative actions into the criminal procedure legislation of Russia. At the same time, up to date, no serious scientific research has been conducted on the experience of using such measures in criminal proceedings of foreign states, and the risks associated with them are not always considered by supporters of covert investigative actions. The issue of the introduction of special (covert) investigative actions into the criminal proceedings of Russia is a particular manifestation of a broader problem, i.e. the forms and procedure for using the results of operational-investigative activities in criminal procedural proving, the possibility to use its results as evidence. Studying the expediency of the use within the domestic procedural form of covert actions is performed by the authors on the basis of the use of a wide range of general scientific and special methods: the method of materialistic dialectics (the question of the legal nature of secret investigative actions is investigated in connection with other procedural issues, with regard to the historical experience of the development of legislation and law enforcement), historical, sociological, logical, as well as comparative legal, formal legal, and logical legal. Considerable attention is paid to the comparison of the position of the domestic legislator in terms of the problem under consideration and its solving in the legislation of countries with the continental and Anglo-American types of criminal proceedings, as well as in the post-Soviet states. The authors come to the conclusion that the problem of using the results of the operative-investigative activities in the criminal procedural proving is artificial, which does not exclude the need to create at the level of federal law a detailed procedure for their submission in criminal proceedings. As a reason for the inadmissibility of introduction in criminal process of special (covert) investigative actions (in fact ‚Äì operative-investigative activities), the article proves the perception of the official conducting proceedings on a criminal case as a participant in the process performing the justiciary (close to judicial) function (such an official exists in different forms in the criminal process of practically each state).

They illustrate a promising direction for research with limited data availability. When GAN learns the semantic-rich data distribution from a dataset, the density of the generated distribution tends to concentrate on the training data. Due to the gradient parameters of the deep neural network contain the data distribution of the training samples, they can easily remember the training samples. When GAN is applied to private or sensitive data, for instance, patient medical records, as private information may be leakage. To address this issue, we propose a Privacy-preserving Generative Adversarial Network (PPGAN) model, in which we achieve differential privacy in GANs by adding well-designed noise to the gradient during the model learning procedure.

The network latency is an important influence factor on response time. Busy poll socket (BPS) is a new mechanism that can reduce network latency by introducing extra energy cost to busily poll RX queue. Unlike hardware dependent solutions such as RDMA, busy poll socket can improve performance without specialized hardware and transplanting applications. BPS now becomes mature and is supported by many off-The-shelf network interface cards. In this paper, we compare the mechanisms of BPS and NAPI. We make a comprehensive analysis about both BPS and NAPI mechanisms. We analyze which factors would influence latencies in BPS and NAPI modes respectively.

However, in certain scenarios, such as the Cultural heritage one, it is often required to provide SaaS, IaaS and PaaS cross-functionality support to users and cross-tenant resource visibility among isolated tenants. In the CH scenario, for example, restorers and professionals may often need to connect and to share temporarily data among different tenants or to work with old customized software requiring the possibility to exploit specific management functionalities that are typically available not at the SaaS but at the IaaS or PaaS layers. This paper proposes a middleware called Registry that can provide additional functionalities to different user categories by joining the SaaS with the IaaS layer and that offers also multi-tenancy operations making private data available to certain project on-demand and enabling, in this way, cross-tenant data sharing.

The energy efficiency has been received more attention by researchers due to constrained energy battery. From earlier research, the vast majority of energy consumption is used for neighbors detecting. Duty-cycle strategy is an efficient way to improve power efficiency, whereas it is too simple to take advantage of contacting opportunities. Therefore, we designed a sleeping strategy for the mobile devices, and named self-Adaptive duty-cycle, which based on the social contacts of the devices in the urban scenario. This approach mainly focuses on the historical encounters of the devices, and then it uses the weighted moving average approach to predict the encounter situation of the mobile device, and adjust the size of the duty-cycle to achieve the energy-saving purpose.

After editing code, developers receive immediate feedback about which design rules are satisfied and which are violated, notifying developers who miss design decisions about the existence of these design decisions.

Optimization techniques rely on approximating simulation states towards target velocity or density field configurations, which are often handcrafted by artists to indirectly control smoke dynamics. Patch synthesis techniques transfer image textures or simulation features to a target flow field. However, these are either limited to adding structural patterns or augmenting coarse flows with turbulent structures, and hence cannot capture the full spectrum of different styles and semantically complex structures. In this paper, we propose the first Transport-based Neural Style Transfer (TNST) algorithm for volumetric smoke data. Our method is able to transfer features from natural images to smoke simulations, enabling general content-aware manipulations ranging from simple patterns to intricate motifs. The proposed algorithm is physically inspired, since it computes the density transport from a source input smoke to a desired target configuration. Our transport-based approach allows direct control over the divergence of the stylization velocity field by optimizing incompressible and irrotational potentials that transport smoke towards stylization.

Second, the design method of static output feedback controller is proposed to guarantee that the resultant closed-loop system is stochastically stable with the pre-specified H‚àû performance index Œ≥. Since the conditions obtained for the existence of controllers are not expressed strictly in terms of linear matrix inequalities, a modified cone complementarity linearization algorithm is given to solve the static output feedback controller gains.

1406,1440,1440,Classification models for handling incomplete data using entropy,". All rights reserved.The data containing missing data is defined as incomplete data. This incomplete data processing problem occurs frequently in a ubiquitous environment using multiple sensors or information, and the research that deals with this problem is very important for developing a classification model with high accuracy.This paper introduces a method to solve the missing part of incomplete data based on the data extension technique. The data extension is divided into a part to fill in the value of the missing variable and a part to process the weight indicating the importance of each event record. As a method for compensating for missing data, a data expansion technique has been proposed and applied to a wide range of fields to produce good results. The method attempts to maximize Entropy by assigning equal probability values to the missing variables. For this reason, the Entropy-based algorithm (C4.5 etc.) played a role of preventing this variable from being selected at the root of the decision tree. However, this method does not use the information inherent in the training data by ignoring the existing information as well as the record containing the damage variable in the training data and assigning the same value uniformly according to the cardinality of the damage variable. In contrast, in this paper, the basic idea is to extract the information inherent in the training data using Entropy, and then to preserve the information by assigning the damage variable in the form of probability.Experimental results show how much information can be recovered using the proposed corrupted data processing technique. This experiment set the degree of loss in UCI data in five steps and then examined how much information was recovered from the lost data. As a result, slightly different results were produced depending on the number of variables in the training data, but the results were generally good.Researches on how to utilize the information inherent in lost learning data without ignoring it are necessary. In the simplest case, a study should be followed to find the most efficient method through various experiments on various methods such as assigning the average value of the information inherent in the damaged variable.

However, with the increasing complexity of telecommunication network, the traditional methods may not work well. It's necessary to study new automatic association rules extraction methods. In this paper, we proposed a method called DCSA (Density-based Clustering and Sequential Association Analysis) for alarm association rules mining. We use time density-based clustering and FP-Growth algorithm to mine the association rules in alarm data, which overcomes the drawbacks of sliding windows method.

The variability and trend of rice price become its main concern. Based on the data obtained from Indonesian national statistics agency, it shows that there is an increasing trend toward the retail price of rice in traditional markets. The price of rice has uniqueness in the process of determining it. Many variables have influenced the price and it is highly regulated. In order to help the decision maker to determine the price, they somehow need a clear insight of future trend of its price changing regarding to several influencing variable. Thus, an appropriate forecasting should be conducted.

1412,1446,1446,Application of the IWA anaerobic digestion model (ADM1) for the valorization of maize residues in Morocco,"r.l.-All rights reserved.The modeling of the natural biological process of anaerobic digestion (AD) or methanization is a metabolic process of fermenting the organic waste in a biogas reactor without oxygen. The Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) discovered by international water association (IWA) is the model used for the simulation study conducted in order to demonstrate and evaluate the applicability of ADM1 to lignocellulosic biomass (LB) such as maize waste (MW) in Morocco which is the subject of this research. In this paper, the technique of anaerobic digestion has been used as a way to recover the solid waste, which is the MW into biogas, by the process of fermentation of the complex polymers into monomers and oligomers. The use of ADM1 has been based on the integrity of this model that takes into account many variables and many settings, such as the physico-chemical processes, which are very important systems in the modeling of anaerobic digestion, as well as the biochemical process that includes biochemical equations which compose the core of any model that include biological reactions. This study has been done by using the anaerobic digestion model 1 (ADM1) under mesophilic temperature (35C), knowing that the mathematical and numerical modeling of this study is the main objective. This work has been done with the intention of modeling and simulating the production of methane from the degradation of organic waste, under different ranges of pH, in order to see what effects may be applied to the acidogenesis and methanogenesis phases, taking in consideration the effect of the inhibition phenomena.

1413,1447,1447,Accelerated complex-step finite difference for expedient deformable simulation,"In deformable simulation, an important computing task is to calculate the gradient and derivative of the strain energy function in order to infer the corresponding internal force and tangent stiffness matrix. The standard numerical routine is the finite difference method, which evaluates the target function multiple times under a small real-valued perturbation. Unfortunately, the subtractive cancellation prevents us from setting this perturbation sufficiently small, and the regular finite difference is doomed for computing problems requiring a high-accuracy derivative evaluation. In this paper, we graft a new finite difference scheme, namely the complex-step finite difference (CSFD), with physics-based animation. CSFD is based on the complex Taylor series expansion, which avoids subtractions in first-order derivative approximation. As a result, one can use a very small perturbation to calculate the numerical derivative that is as accurate as its analytic counterpart. We accelerate the original CSFD method so that it is also as efficient as the analytic derivative. This is achieved by discarding high-order error terms, decoupling real and imaginary calculations, replacing costly functions based on the theory of equivalent infinitesimal, and isolating the propagation of the perturbation in composite/nesting functions. CSFD can be further augmented with multicomplex Taylor expansion and Cauchy-Riemann formula to handle higher-order derivatives and tensor-valued functions. We demonstrate the accuracy, convenience, and efficiency of this new numerical routine in the context of deformable simulation - one can easily deploy a robust simulator for general hyperelastic materials, including user-crafted ones to cater specific needs in different applications. Higher-order derivatives of the energy can be readily computed to construct modal derivative bases for reduced real-time simulation. Inverse simulation problems can also be conveniently solved using gradient/Hessian-based optimization procedures.",60117933,"State Key Lab of CAD&amp;CG, Zhejiang University",Hangzhou,China,['1704'],23.0,0.03362193362193363,0.4498895548895548,1,0.1253731343283582,0.026865671641791045,0.2819672131147541

1415,1449,1449,Stance Detection of Microblog Text Based on Two-Channel CNN-GRU Fusion Network,"In recent years, stance detection has become an important topic in the field of natural language processing. In earlier work, researchers have used feature engineering for stance detection but they need to define and extract appropriate features according to the particular application. This leads to poor generalization and a complex modeling process. Other researchers have applied deep learning methods. However, the popular convolutional neural network (CNN) method has the problem of information loss and a single-size CNN filter cannot accurately extract features that have different lengths from text, and so cannot deal with the diverse nature of features. In order to address these problems, we propose a two-channel CNN-GRU fusion network. First, a convolution layer with two filters with different window sizes is used to extract local features within the topic content and text content. Then, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is used to extract their timing characteristics. After that, the intermediate features are spliced and input to a classifier to complete the stance detection. Our method is validated using data from NLPCC 2016. The experimental results show that ACC and average F1 score of this method are 13.1% and 15.6% better than SVM method, 6.2% and 11.6% better than CNN method, 5.6% and 3.3% better than GRU method, and 1.1% and 2.2% better compared with hybrid model proposed by Nanyu, respectively, which is used as a baseline with no increase in run-time, and achieves the same accuracy with less run-time than another baseline of a semantic attention-based model proposed by Zhou. In addition, our method allows better classification than the single channel model. Finally, we find that the operation time of a multi-channel CNN-GRU increases gradually with increasing number of channels, but the classification accuracy does not improve, so a two-channel CNN-GRU is the most appropriate choice.",60005566,Beijing Union University,Beijing,China,['1700'],23.0,0.15817972350230414,0.4526113671274961,1,0.09340659340659341,0.04395604395604396,0.3372093023255814
1416,1450,1450,The relightables: Volumetric performance capture of humans with realistic relighting,"We present ""The Relightables"", a volumetric capture system for photorealistic and high quality relightable full-body performance capture. While significant progress has been made on volumetric capture systems, focusing on 3D geometric reconstruction with high resolution textures, much less work has been done to recover photometric properties needed for relighting. Results from such systems lack high-frequency details and the subject's shading is prebaked into the texture. In contrast, a large body of work has addressed relightable acquisition for image-based approaches, which photograph the subject under a set of basis lighting conditions and recombine the images to show the subject as they would appear in a target lighting environment. However, to date, these approaches have not been adapted for use in the context of a high-resolution volumetric capture system. Our method combines this ability to realistically relight humans for arbitrary environments, with the benefits of free-viewpoint volumetric capture and new levels of geometric accuracy for dynamic performances. Our subjects are recorded inside a custom geodesic sphere outfitted with 331 custom color LED lights, an array of high-resolution cameras, and a set of custom highresolution depth sensors. Our system innovates in multiple areas: First, we designed a novel active depth sensor to capture 12.4MP depth maps, which we describe in detail. Second, we show how to design a hybrid geometric and machine learning reconstruction pipeline to process the high resolution input and output a volumetric video. Third, we generate temporally consistent reflectance maps for dynamic performers by leveraging the information contained in two alternating color gradient illumination images acquired at 60 Hz.

1418,1452,1452,An SDN-based Hybrid Strategy for Load Balancing in Data Center Networks,"th for various services. Yet today's widely used load balancing scheme, i.e., ECMP, may cause serious congestion when hash collision happens. Recent proposals either push load balancing function to a centralized controller or network edges. However, the centralized schemes are too slow for latency-sensitive flows, while the distributed schemes lack the global view and usually cannot make the best choices. In this paper, based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN), we present a new hybrid load balancing scheme called BLEND. It promotes the cooperation among network components and takes advantage of both global view and fast end-host action. BLEND aims to improve the throughput of big flows and reduce the latency of small and medium flows. It employs a controller to assign paths to big flows to achieve high throughput. In addition, in order to provide guidance for fast distributed load balancing decisions, the controller also calculates the optimal network delay thresholds for small and medium flows, while hosts utilize these thresholds to decide whether to change the current paths. BLEND is practical and easily deployable in the current data center networks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BLEND outperforms both the centralized and distributed schemes and achieves at most 40% reduction in FCT and at most 2.8 times improvement in throughput.",60105683,Southern University of Science and Technology,Shenzhen,China,"['1712', '1711', '1706', '1705']",18.90909090909091,0.06585454545454546,0.3517818181818182,1,0.1375,0.0375,0.3504273504273504

Therefore improvement of the reliability of the used techniques and finding better correlations between the test results and the mechanical properties of masonry has proven to be of great importance. While several diagnostic procedures are commonly used in practice to test mechanical properties of masonry, e.g. Schmidt hammer test, analysis of drilled samples, penetration tests, etc. the results of these methods are considered reliable under laboratory conditions, several additional factors have to be taken into account in case of an in-situ application of these methods, that may largely affect the obtained results and conclusions. The results of the diagnostic procedures therefore need to be interpreted with a view to these environmental factors.

Indeed, advantages including better line-of-sight (LOS), wider communication range and more flexible on-demand deployment make UAVs play a unique role in rescue and disaster scenarios. Emergency tasks assigned to UAVs such as people search and rescue usually require real-Time responses, since it is a lifeand-death matter regarding the post-disaster relief. Considering the limited computing resources and harsh energy supply replenishment for UAVs in the post-disaster relief operations, we in this paper propose a hybrid fog computing paradigm called H-FVFC that integrates UAVs and vehicular fog computing (VFC) to run the highly demanding tasks with strict latency requirements. An architecture of H-FVFC consisting of three layers is proposed and investigated in this paper, with hope to explore the possibilities of applying this computing paradigm to post-disaster relief operations. Experiments are carried out to evaluate the task offloading in H-FVFC compared to UAV-To-Cloud scheduling strategy. The results show that task offloading in the UAV-To-Vehicle way can significantly reduce the response latency.

The analysis determined that particular PC's are not mutually exclusive but rather, interrelates with other process capabilities to drive greater operational maturity in organizations. Thus, this research study aims to provide an analysis in the interrelationship of each process capabilities and leveraging it for the future state of the organization.

However, with the occurrence of holes, geographic routing incurs with the so-called local minimum problem that may lead to a long hole detour path as well as the traffic concentration around the hole boundary. In consequence, the network lifetime is shortened. In this paper, we aim at proposing a lightweight distributed geographic routing protocol, which can prolong the lifetime of WSNs under the hole occurrence. Our main idea is to exploiting Q-learning technique to estimate the distance from a node to the holes. The routing decision is then determined based on the residual energy of the nodes, their estimated distance to the holes, and their distance to the destination.

1428,1462,1462,Formal specification and validation of refinement from WS-CDL to BPEL,"Service composition is a primary task in the development of service-oriented systems. The Web Service Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) and the Web Service Choreography Descriptor Language (WS-CDL) are two major languages for Web services modeling and implementation. Although these two composition models are of a different nature, they are complementary. WS-CDL serves as a behavioral modeling language for collaboration between multiple participants (web services) within the same business process from a global point of view. However, WS-BPEL allows a service composition process to be described at different levels of abstraction.

1429,1463,1463,Using eye tracking to expose cognitive processes in understanding conceptual models," All rights reserved.Conceptual models are used to communicate information about a domain during the development of information systems. In two experimental studies using business process models, we demonstrate how eye tracking can contribute to understanding the cognitive processes by which readers use conceptual modeling scripts to perform problem solving tasks. In the first study, we compare scripts generated using two process modeling grammars and demonstrate how attention paid to specific parts of scripts generated using grammar variations, and differences in visual association between parts of a diagram, account for task performance. In the second study, we use a combination of eye tracking and verbal protocol analysis to examine how visual association between parts of conceptual modeling scripts can indicate cognitive integration while performing problem solving tasks. The studies show that task performance can be explained with different mental processes, reflected in specific eye tracking behavior, where scripts developed following different rules invoke different cognitive processes. We show that attention can be measured by eye tracking and can explain task performance. In addition, we show that visual association (which is observable) between parts of a modeling script involves cognitive integration (which is not observable). This finding can be used to improve conceptual modeling grammars in several ways, including understanding the effects of alternative visual arrangements of models on how effectively they communicate domain knowledge for particular tasks, and guiding the design of visual modeling notations.",60028590,St. Louis University,St. Louis,United States,"['1710', '1706']",29.375,0.05877192982456141,0.237719298245614,0,0.18532818532818532,0.0,0.3046875

This type of application poses a significant challenge to network topology because strengthening the monitoring of the living conditions and collecting underwater data on organisms in different regions is necessary. In this paper, a new concept of 'subregional monitoring' is proposed, and subregions with frequent activities of marine organisms are taken as the key monitoring areas, i.e., the areas of interest (AOIs). Then, SFRG, an energy-balanced and robust topology based on scale-free network and rigid graph theory, is proposed to strengthen the monitoring of the AOIs. The topology of a rigid graph is constructed in AOI, and the entire network is scale-free network with power-law degree distribution, when the rigid graph is regarded as a 'node'. Furthermore, a transmission algorithm based on the SFRG is suggested to prolong the network lifetime. The algorithm guarantees that 90% of the received packets are from the AOIs. The simulation results demonstrate that the SFRG effectively prolongs the network lifetime and improves the network robustness, which provides a strong support in strengthening the monitoring of AOIs and balancing the energy consumption.",60030931,University of Oklahoma,Norman,United States,['1708'],26.0,0.16497668997668996,0.6913752913752913,1,0.10569105691056911,0.016260162601626018,0.3432203389830508

These systems have been developed in response to the changing models of care to an ongoing relationship between patient and care team, supported by the use of technology due to the increased instance of chronic disease. However, the use of HITS may increase the risk to patient safety and security. While standards can be used to address and manage these risks, significant communication problems exist between experts working in different departments. These departments operate in silos often leading to communication breakdowns. For example, risk management stakeholders who are not clinicians may struggle to understand, define and manage risks associated with these systems when talking to medical professionals as they do not understand medical terminology or the associated care processes. In order to overcome this communication problem, we propose the use of the 'Three Amigos' approach together with the use of the SIMPLE tool that has been developed to assist patients in understanding medical terms.

Whereas MEC enables to reduce latency significantly by allowing applications to be deployed close to end users, NFV allows for flexible deployment of virtualized network functions. The performance and flexibility can be improved further by combining MEC and NFV. Existing frameworks for managing and orchestrating MEC applications and NFV are either tightly coupled or completely separated. The former design is inflexible and increases the complexity of one framework, while the latter leads to inefficient use of computation resources. In this paper, we extend our Automated Provisioning Framework for MEC (APMEC), which combines each MEC application and its respective network service (comprising a chain of virtual network functions) in a MEC service. We propose a novel MEC service placement algorithm allowing to reuse a subset of yet underloaded network functions.

However, GEO-based solutions inevitably face the bottleneck problem because all the routing requests have to be processed and forwarded by a limited number of GEO satellites. In this paper, we propose HTCA, a Hierarchical Terrestrial Controllers Architecture based on SDN that reuses the ground stations instead of dedicated GEO satellites to establish a more scalable control plane. But the limited coverage of a ground station brings about design challenges for consistent network management and seamless routing service. HTCA adopts an online network view integration method to support flexible and consistent management.

Multi-RAT is effective when multipath transmission is used over multichannels. This is why multipath based transmission is one of the key technologies that can improve the throughput and reliability of real-time video streaming over 5G networks. This paper proposes two multipath based concurrent transfer techniques; fast concurrent transfer (FCT) and reliable concurrent transfer (RCT). FCT aims to minimize the round trip time (RTT) required for frame transmission by arranging each of the packets constituting a frame to be sent over multiple channels. In an environment where there are multiple channels, RCT performs redundant transmission of packets, so that even if a packet is lost in one path, the lost packet can be received safely over another path. FCT aims at securing the reliability of data transmission. In addition, a multipath based adaptive concurrent transmission (MACT) scheme is proposed which controls the ratio of FCT and RCT adaptively considering the state of the receiver buffer, inflow throughput, and decoding rate to enhance the reliability and throughput performance.

Because of good data representation ability, recently Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied to factorization machines to learn high-order interactions. However, the interactions with DNNs are generated implicitly. In this paper, we propose a novel factorization machine named High-order Cross Factorization Machine (HCFM), which is an efficient and explicit high-order feature interaction factorization machine. The main component that we design for HCFM is an explicit cross network: Cross Weights Network (CWN). CWN considers both the weights of different feature combinations and interaction orders, which can capture the inherent correlations of real-word data. In CWN, cross and compression layers can learn different weights of feature interactions efficiently. Different weights of interaction orders can be learned by the weights pooling layer. CWN not only retains the important interaction features but also avoids the complex interaction computations.

A key challenge here is satisfying the Quality-of-Service requirement of online services that requires short response time while maximizing the resource utilization. While applications should be co-located to improve the resource utilization, the co-location results in performance interference between the co-located applications that hurts the QoS of latency-sensitive services. To understand this problem in depth, we characterize and analyze the real business-level application co-location scenario based on the trace of an actual Cloud product released by Alibaba. Our observation shows that the datacenter suffers from severe load imbalance that often results in QoS violation of the online services on the servers with heavy workload.

One common approach being adopted is the delivery of MC services together with commercial traffic over public mobile networks and the use of prioritization mechanisms to protect the MC connections in congestion situations. However, this approach leaves commercial traffic unprotected in front of a non-controlled surge of MC traffic in specific cells since all resources would be allocated to serve this traffic. In this context, this paper proposes a solution to properly multiplex MC and commercial services with congestion protection for both types of services. The solution is based on the exploitation of the network slicing features brought into the new 5G standards. In particular, the paper describes how different slices can be parameterized in a 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) so that radio load guarantees can be established for each type of service. The proposed solution is evaluated in an illustrative scenario by means of simulations.

1448,1482,1482,Anti-Islanding Detection Method Using Phase-Shifted Feed-Forward Voltage in Grid-Connected Inverter,"For safety and maintenance problems, the grid-connected inverters have been required to detect whether the utility voltage source is connected or disconnected to the grid. If the inverter continues to energize local loads while the utility voltage source is disconnected, it is called islanding operation. This paper proposes a new islanding detection method using phase shifted feed-forward voltage. In the grid-connected inverter system, the PCC voltage is simultaneously measured, and those values are used as the feed-forward values in the current controller. In this paper, the phase of feed-forward voltage is modified to detect the islanding condition. As the measured PCC frequency changes, the proposed method modifies the phase of feed-forward voltage. Because the phase angle of feed-forward voltage is determined according to the variation of measured frequency of PCC voltage, the proposed method makes positive feedback to the frequency. If the frequency variation exceeds the allowable range, it is judged to be islanding operation. Since the frequency response of the proposed method is fast, the islanding operation could be detected in 90 ms despite high quality-factor ($Q_{f}$), 10. Moreover, when the grid is normal condition but grid frequency changes in allowable range, the proposed method does not produce continuous reactive power which reduces the quality of inverter output power. Lastly, proposed method has very small NDZ because there is no limitation on reactive power injection.

Giving discounts and promos to all customers has not provided benefits to a company in retaining customers. These two things are currently being experienced by LWC Company so that changes are needed in evaluating the strategy taken to keep the relationship with customers, especially potential customers, by forming customer portfolios. Customers portfolios can be analyzed from customer transactions. With customer transactions data, the company can find out which potential customers and the customers who do give less value for the company. The way to analyze customer transaction data is by clustering customers with Fuzzy C-means algorithm by using RFM model. Forming the number of clusters is validated by PCI model and ranking is done by multiplying AHP weight to find the life value of the customer so that it can be known which customer group gives high value to the company. The result of this research is that the customers of LWC Company categorized as superstar customer, typical customer and dormant customer.

1451,1485,1485,A systematic approach to horizontal clustering analysis on embedded rsa implementation,"Side-channel attacks are a threat to cryptographic algorithms running on embedded devices. The exponent blinding is the main countermeasure which resists the classical forms of side-channel attacks. Horizontal side-channel analysis is an effective method to overcome this kind of countermeasures and recover the secret key through the analysis of a single trace. However, it is very difficult to exploit leakage from a single trace in practice, because the segment borders of crucial operation are hard to find and the single execution possibly contains a lot of noise in a real application environment. In this paper, a framework for systematic approach is presented to overcome these drawbacks. Firstly, we propose a method to use the Hilbert-Huang transform for the segment borders detection and the noise reduction. Then, an effective clustering method is used to recover the private key. The proposed horizontal clustering approach is applied to a protected implementation on embedded devices. The results show that the success rate of the key recovery could be up to 98%. Finally, we analyze the mechanism of leakage exploration.",60019533,Tianjin University,Tianjin,China,['1708'],17.5,0.05527210884353742,0.6060090702947847,1,0.11,0.01,0.23958333333333334

In search engines, one of the factors that affects precision is the short lengths of queries. One way to tackle this problem is through the use of the context. Aiming to consider the context of queries, several measures have been proposed to calculate their inter-document similarity, which are known as Query-Sensitive Similarity Measure (QSSM). This paper presents a new QSSM called Query-Document Similarity Measure (QDSM), which is used to build clusters of similar search results. The goal of this measure is to provide clusters of better quality (i.e., clusters with more relevant documents) taking into account the context in which the queries are submitted. To achieve this goal, several experiments were carried out using four well-known algorithms in Information Retrieval (IR) along with the AOL Query Logs Dataset (AOL).

The image is then steganographed in another image, shadow images are then used to create identical images to the stego image. Since there are many similar images it deceives the attacker thus preventing potential loss. At the other end, steganalysis is carried out separating cover images with stego image.

It allows users to search in archives stored on cloud servers. Among searchable encryption schemes, those supporting multiuser settings are more suitable for daily application scenarios and more practical. However, since the cloud server is semi-Trusted, the result set returned by the server is undefined, and most existing multi-user searchable encryption schemes rely heavily on trusted third parties to manage user permission. To address these problems, verifiable multi-user searchable encryption schemes with dynamic management of user search permissions, weak trust on trusted third parties and are desirable. In this paper, we propose such a scheme. Our scheme manages user permission and key distribution without a trusted third party. User search permission and user access permission matrices are generated separately to manage user permissions dynamically.

1462,1497,1497,Acoustic texture rendering for extended sources in complex scenes,"Extended stochastic sources, like falling rain or a flowing waterway, provide an immersive ambience in virtual environments. In complex scenes, the rendered sound should vary naturally with listener position, differing not only in overall loudness but also in texture, to capture the indistinct murmur of a faraway brook versus the bright babbling of one up close. Modeling an ambient sound as a collection of random events such as individual raindrop impacts or water bubble oscillations, this variation can be seen as a change in the statistical distribution of events heard by the listener: The arrival rate of nearby, louder events relative to more distant or occluded, quieter ones. Reverberation and edge diffraction from scene geometry multiply and mix events more extensively compared to an empty scene and introduce salient spatial variation in texture. We formalize the notion of acoustic texture by introducing the event loudness density (ELD), which relates the rapidity of received events to their loudness. To model spatial variation in texture, the ELD is made a function of listener location in the scene. We show that this ELD field can be extracted from a single wave simulation for each extended source and rendered flexibly using a granular synthesis pipeline, with grains derived procedurally or from recordings.

1469,1504,1504,Using hospital claim data to develop referral decision support systems: Improving patient flow from the primary care,"The decision to make a referral for a primary physician is influenced by several factors such as the need for specialist consultation and requesting support for diagnosis or disease management using advanced equipment. Unfortunately, primary care physicians are faced with a number of hospitals that have different resources. This study aims to improve the quality of referral services by facilitating primary care physicians in determining the right referral hospital or specialty care. Prototyping method was used to extend rule-reasoning decision support in an electronic referral system where hospital coordinates and real-time availability of bed exist. The research was conducted in DI Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. Appropriate referral hospital was inferred based on the presence of differential diagnosis and or required procedure. The history of medical diagnosis and procedures from hospital claim data was used as knowledge-based that connect hospital master data. IF ... AND (OR) ... THEN rule-reasoning was used to recommend referral hospitals based on a differential diagnosis and or required medical procedure determined by a primary care physician in the electronic referral system.

In this paper, we present a queuing and service management for congestion control with a retrial system called QSMCC-R. In our model, two logical queues characterize a sensor node, the first is used to store control packets and the second one for data packets. The approach is based on Round Robin policy to serve packets and uses control packets to acknowledge received data packets or to inform other nodes about the congestion if the queue occupancy rate reaches a threshold. Considering two levels of data packets which can transit through the network, QSMCC-R can be more reliable according to the field of application.

Retaining these properties in multiple dimensions or for a substantial number of points can be challenging and computationally expensive. Tackling those two issues, we suggest to automatically generate scalable point patterns from design goals using deep learning. We phrase pattern generation as a deep composition of weighted distance-based unstructured filters. Deep point pattern design means to optimize over the space of all such compositions according to a user-provided point correlation loss, a small program which measures a pattern's fidelity in respect to its spatial or spectral statistics, linear or non-linear (e. g., radial) projections, or any arbitrary combination thereof. Our analysis shows that we can emulate a large set of existing patterns (blue, green, step, projective, stair, etc.-noise), generalize them to countless new combinations in a systematic way and leverage existing error estimation formulations to generate novel point patterns for a user-provided class of integrand functions. Our point patterns scale favorably to multiple dimensions and numbers of points: we demonstrate nearly 10 k points in 10-D produced in one second on one GPU.

Traditional ashcan management is inefficient and has many disadvantages, because managers cannot obtain the realtime state of ashcans efficiently. As a result, it often happens that ashcans are full but not collected in time. Moreover, in special cases that ashcans fall, catch fire, etc., managers should find these ashcans and handle these emergencies as soon as possible. To manage ashcans efficiently, economically and intelligently, in this paper, we propose an edge computing based IAMS. Specifically, in IAMS, each ashcan has an intelligent user equipment (UE) equipped with sensors to measure distance, temperature, smog and tilt. For data transmission, IAMS uses Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT), which has advantages of large transmission range and low cost. Combined with edge computing, the collected data can be processed rapidly and managers can obtain the real-Time state of each ashcan. Moreover, managers can view global information through web browser and mobile devices.

A tailsitter UAV with simplicity as its main characteristic is AVALON (Autonomous VerticAL takeOff and laNding), which also has the disadvantage of a complex operation due to its multiple flight stages. To enable its autonomous procedure, AVALON requires a control system capable of stabilising the flight during its entire operation. Therefore, this paper reports the validation of control structures based on proportional-derivative controllers for AVALON's flight stages with software-in-the-loop experiments in the flight simulator X-Plane.

Our method eliminates transfer moves altogether by generating deposition paths that are continuous within and across layers. Our algorithm is implemented as a sequential top-down pass through the layer stack. In each layer, we detect points that require support, connect support points and model paths, and optimize the shape of the resulting continuous path with respect to length, smoothness, and distance to the model. For each of these subproblems, we propose dedicated solutions that take into account the fabrication constraints imposed by printable clay. We evaluate our method on a set of examples with multiple disconnected components and challenging support requirements.

The Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) might is a suitable way to perform the email ciphertext search. However, most existing PEKS schemes cannot protect the identity privacy of data sender. Deniably authenticated encryption (DAE) technique allows the data sender to deny his/her involvement after the communication. Moreover, the receiver can verify the authenticity of ciphertext in DAE, which assures the identity privacy of data sender. In this paper, so as to solve the above shortages in existing PEKS schemes, we introduce an original scheme called designated server certificateless deniably authenticated encryption with keyword search (dCLDAEKS), where leverages the techniques of DAE and designated server. In dCLDAEKS, data sender authenticates the messages and simultaneously encrypt them. Meanwhile, only designated server has ability to execute search ciphertext operation for receivers. So there is no adversary including the server can launch inside or outside offline KGA. Therefore dCLDAEKS scheme can better protect the identity privacy of data sender.

1488,1523,1523,Network Coded Cooperative Multicast in Integrated Terrestrial-Satellite Networks,"Wireless services have been extended from connection-centric to content-centric and this brings rapid increasing data traffic. Considering the concurrent multiple requests for popular contents, multicast is a promising delivery scheme to exploit content reuse. Satellite multicast is superior to others due to the coverage. When terrestrial base stations (BSs) are integrated with the satellite, cooperative transmission is then enabled to handle the fading satellite channels as well as maximize data throughput. Therefore, this paper proposes a co-operative multicast scheme for content delivery in the integrated terrestrial-satellite networks (ITSN) which is further enhanced by network coding. To exploit bandwidth of both terrestrial base stations (BSs) and the satellite, this cooperative multicast scheme uses two-phase transmission. The satellite multicast contents to subscribers in an opportunistic manner with real-time data rate adaptation. Then terrestrial BSs retransmit the lost packets for reliable transmission. Ground users are allocated to subgroups for the channel diversities while network coding is applied to packet loss recovery with fewer retransmissions.

1489,1524,1524,MIS compensation: Optimizing sampling techniques in multiple importance sampling,"Multiple importance sampling (MIS) has become an indispensable tool in Monte Carlo rendering, widely accepted as a near-optimal solution for combining different sampling techniques. But an MIS combination, using the common balance or power heuristics, often results in an overly defensive estimator, leading to high variance. We show that by generalizing the MIS framework, variance can be substantially reduced. Specifically, we optimize one of the combined sampling techniques so as to decrease the overall variance of the resulting MIS estimator.

The algorithm has much lower computational complexity and can be expected to be faster than the existing multi-class SVMs. However, when facing multi-class problem of imbalanced data, the MBSVM which adopts hinge loss is easily leads to instability for resampling.

Photoplethysmography (PPG) was considered to be an alternative way to assess HRV using the Peak-to-Peak interval series (PPI). Since previous studies already reported the availability to use PPG to assess HRV instead ECG, this study investigated how the HRV properties using those two methods during different postures with a fixed breathing pattern. Ten subjects participated in this study and we observed the R-R and the Peak-Peak beat interval time series from ECG and PPG respectively during sitting-supine, and standing-supine postures with 3 seconds breathing pattern. The results showed that using PPG to assess HRV still can be used with caution, especially during supine posture that had a deviation (SD) difference between ECG and PPG from the inter-subject analysis (p < 0.05).

It was found that the purity of the initial aluminum foil as well as the thickness of the obtained dielectric membranes influence their optical (perpendicular transmittance through the membranes) and dielectric properties (dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent). The main benefit of these investigations is the established dielectric anisotropy of the test samples (different dielectric parameters in parallel and perpendicular directions to the sample surface), which confirms the metamaterial-like character of anodic aluminium oxide (AAO). Three types of AAO samples' behaviour were observed due to the realized purity: 1) relatively pure dielectrics with equivalent dielectric constant ‚àº5-7 and less; 2) lossy dielectrics with contaminations (‚àº7-10) and 3) poor dielectrics with increased conductivity due to the metal inclusions (equivalent dielectric constant above 10 and equivalent conductivity 0.25-50 S/m).

Generally, the polarization-diversity detection of PS-OCT is free-space type, which is usually very complicated and reduces Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). We built a polarization depth-encoding PS-OCT system with fiber-based polarization-diversity detection unit. The PS-OCT system was based on swept source OCT operating at 1310 nm, which has 100 kHz axial scan rates. The polarization depth-encoding was implemented by polarization-dependent spectral delay by combining of a polarization beam splitter (PBS) and two quarter-wavelength plates. The fiber-based polarization-diversity detection unit was implemented by the combination of fiber based polarization beam splitters and polarization controllers, which was used to calibrate the input light polarization of the fiberbased polarization beam splitters (FPBS). The acquired spectral signals were processed with standard Fourier domain OCT procedure including background subtraction, numerical dispersion compensation, zero padding and Fourier transforming.

Assistant Based Speech Recognition (ABSR) systems with high command recognition rates and low error rates have proven to dramatically reduce ATCos‚Äô workload and increase capacity as an effect. However, those ABSR systems need accurate hypotheses about expected commands to achieve the necessary performance.

While on another hand, it might pose a malicious effect on public safety, so the most important problem to be addressed is the recognition of drones in sensitive areas. This paper addressed the machine learning approach to recognize UAV through its acoustic emission using representative algorithms of Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction and random forest (RNF) classifier for classification. However, temporal and spectral features are devised to demonstrate performances of beam-formed signals (enhanced emitter at desired direction) and raw signal (captured in flying test). Results of extracted features from a beam-formed signal, demonstrate the effectiveness of MFCC performance regardless of a noisy environment with a high accuracy rate as compared to raw signal. RNF classifier was trained to classify feature vector, which is obtained from the feature extraction stage. However, the classifier helped to classify samples from a small data set with good accuracy.

High-quality Raman spectra were obtained from 50 normal liver cells (Lo2 cell line) and 50 hepatoma cells (HepG2 cell line) in the range of 500-1750 cm-1. There are significant differences in Raman spectra between normal liver cells and hepatoma cells, which indicated special changes in the content of biomolecules including nucleic acids, proteins and lipid in different cell lines. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminate analysis (LDA) were used to classify the Raman spectra obtained from hepatoma cells and normal liver cells, and the discrimination sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 100%, respectively. In addition, PCA in conjunction with support vector machine (SVM) (with a Gaussian radial basis function) was also employed to classify the same Raman spectra dataset, and the sensitivity and specificity could be improved to 100% and 100%, respectively, indicating that the classification performance of PCA-SVM is superior to that of PCA-LDA.

1515,1551,1551,NIWPT: NLOS identification based on channel state information,"With the development of wireless technology, Wi-Fi devices are extensively deployed in indoor environments. This fosters the development of Wi-Fi signal-based services and applications, e.g., indoor intrusion detection, human gesture recognition, indoor localization. However, the indoor environments are often complex and variable, Wi-Fi signals from transmitters through multiple paths to reach receivers. There is a large number of Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) paths between the transmitter and the receiver, which causes seriously signal fading, deteriorating the quality of communication links, decreasing the accuracy of recognition application, and increasing the complexity of systems. In this study, an NLOS identification based on the wavelet packet transform (NIWPT) method is proposed. First, NIWPT collects raw channel state information (CSI) signals on the physical layer in current links. Then, NIWPT applies threelayer wavelet packet decomposition on the amplitude of CSI. A set of the wavelet packet coefficient, wavelet packet energy spectrum, information entropy, and logarithmic energy entropy as a feature vector is acquired. After that, the support vector machine is utilized to identify NLOS paths in the current links. Compared with other methods, NIWPT does not need to pre-process the raw CSI signals, it not only maximally reserves influence of the environment on the propagation signal, but also reflects the indoor environment more truly. The experimental results indicate that the recognition accuracy rate of the NIWPT method is 96.23% and 94.75% in the dynamic and static environments, respectively. It proves that the proposed method can effectively identify NLOS paths and has high identification accuracy and universality.",60028009,Yunnan University,Kunming,China,['1706'],20.83333333333333,0.06687685330542473,0.4195002616431188,1,0.09090909090909091,0.06493506493506493,0.3595890410958904

Inteins are mobile protein splicing elements capable of self-splicing post-translationally. They exist in viruses and bacteriophage, notwithstanding this broad phylogenetic distribution, all inteins apportion common structural features. A method was developed to predict intein in a raw sequence, using a ranking and scoring scheme based on amino acid Œ∏ value tables. This method aided in the identification and assessment of patterns characterizing the intein sequences. New intein conserved properties are revealed and the known ones are described and localized. We have computed the Œ∏ value of each amino acid at block A positions +1 to +13, block B positions l+13 to l+26 and block G positions -7 to +1 for the three categories. The consensus amino acids thus found are listed at the end of each row. We gave statistics for the distance between the blocks, block A to B, block B to F, and block F to G with the average being 66.1, 294, and 10.2 amino acids, respectively.

1522,1558,1558,Using process mining for predicting relationships of couples sitting on a sofa,"This research is a synergy of Internet of Things (IoT), Process Mining (PM) and Behavior Analysis (BA) fields of study. In the first IoT-related part of the paper, a Wi-Fi P2P system (Peer to Peer) including a set of Smart Sofas, which were easily connected with a Xbox Kinect Camera without requiring a wireless access, was initially designed and developed. The Smart Sofas contained Weight Pressure Sensors, whereas, the Smart Cameras worked based on a Facial Recognition algorithm. The system was capable of identifying, recording and storing the exact location of a couple (i.e., two individuals) sitting on them in addition to their body language/gesture. Subsequently, 74 couples (or 148 persons) were voluntarily invited to join an experiment with the purpose of studying their behavior-within the duration of time they were used to getting back home from work-when sitting (or lying down) on a pair of smart sofas that was deliberately inserted in the living room of their home. The experiment lasted for one month and excluded the weekends so as to give the couples enough privacy they needed to carry on their normal life without any annoyance or disturbance. In the second part of the study, the Fuzzy Miner algorithm, which is a process discovery technique, was applied on the collected/synchronized (sofa and camera) data. To do this, the Disco Fluxicon, which is a Process Mining platform/tool, was used. The couples' data (i.e., the Sofa and Camera data) included 888 Events with a Mean Case Duration of 3.1 minutes. In the third part of the study, the data was divided into two separate event logs as the following: (1) The event log of the couples who showed/reported 'Having Problems' in their relationship while taking part in the experiment, versus, (2) The event log of the couples who showed/reported 'Not Having Any Problems'. Furthermore, the 'Not Having Any Problems' data also was divided into another two sub-sets as follows: (i) Those who felt 'Extremely Happy and Satisfied' versus (ii) Those who felt happy but in a very 'Normal and Ordinary (Neutral)' way in their relationship. Subsequently, a statistical analysis of binary classification in terms of a Confusion Matrix and based on the F1-Score coefficient (or F-measure) was conducted so as to consider both the Precision and the Recall coefficients of the results. According to the findings of the study, with rather a high degree of accuracy (i.e., F-Score = 0.7563), it was realized that the couples who were 'Not Having Any Problems' in their relationship showed tendency to represent/manifest one (or a mixture) of the following sitting positions while sitting on a sofa, respectively: 'Legs on Lap', 'Cuddling in the Corner', 'Corner Cuddle with Tucked Legs', 'Side-by-Side (Touching but Not Cuddling)' and 'Cuddling in the Middle'.

1525,1561,1561,Super-resolution ultrasound imaging implemented by SOFI in radio-frequency domain,"Ultrasound (US) is one of the major medical imaging models and has been widely applied in clinical practice. However, the spatial resolution of US is limited to approximately half-wavelength of sound wave. To address this problem, super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) imaging technique based on single molecule localization has been proposed, which can achieve a ten-fold resolution improvement compared with the conventional US imaging techniques. But, the temporal resolution of SR-US is low. Inspired by super-resolution optical microscopy, recently, a super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) method has been applied in SR-US to improve temporal resolution. However, in the previous work, SOFI is used to process B-mode US sequence (i.e., the image domain), which may affect the obtained imaging performance of SR-US. To further improve the spatial resolution of SR-US, in this work, we propose an alternative method, termed as RF-SOFI, where SOFI is used to process data in radio-frequency (RF) domain. Further, to reduce data acquisition time, here, US data are acquired by plane wave (PW) scan. To evaluate the performance of the proposed RF-SOFI method, numerical simulation experiments were performed. The results indicate that compared to the previous reported SOFI method (i.e., SOFI applied in image domain), the imaging performance of SR-US can be improved by using RF-SOFI (i.e., SOFI applied in RF domain).

The eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is needed when the likelihood function is replaced by MUSIC spatial spectrum function.

This initiative is called TSAT operation. Too much of a pushback delay, however, can affect take-off‚Äôs punctuality. Therefore, appropriate assignment of pushback time is the key to an efficient TSAT operation. The assigned pushback time depends on various factors, such as the runway traffic demand and the uncertainty of traffic movement. This research uses real operational data from a target French airport to develop a realistic airport simulation model and simulate TSAT operation. According to the result, the selection of pushback time assignment algorithm can improve the performance of TSAT operation, but the estimation accuracy of pushback time provided by airlines is insufficient to introduce TSAT operation at this target airport.

1537,1573,1573,A multiple-chaotic approach for steganography," Alwan and Zahir M. Hussain.In a recent work, chaos has been utilized to modify addresses of message bits while hidden in a cover image. In this study, we extend the above technique to include multiple chaotic maps for increased security. Three systems have been modified using chaotic-address mapping for image steganography in the spatial domain. The first system, the well-known LSB technique, is based on the selection of pixels and then hides secret message in the Least Significant Bits LSBs of the given pixel. The second system is based on searching for the identical bits between the secret message and the cover image. The third system is based on the concept of LSB substitution. It employs mapping of secret data bits onto the cover pixel bits. To increase the security performance of the above chaos-based steganographic techniques, multiple-chaotic maps are introduced in this study by using multiple formulas to generate chaotic sequences used to track the addresses of shuffled bits. The generated chaotic sequences were evaluated to determine the randomness (using correlation tests) and the chaotic characteristics of a nonlinear system (using Lyapunov exponent, Poincare section and 0-1 test). The performance and security levels of the proposed techniques were evaluated by using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE), histogram analysis and correlative analysis.

The main challenges in this issue are how to distinguish the 5mC site from the unmethylated ones in the chain of nucleotides, and determine its amount. To streamline the tedious operations in traditional bisulfite conversion (BC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based detection methods, lots of graphene derivatives and electrochemistry (EC) sensors have been exploited. In this work, we would like to propose an electronic method for DNA methylation detection by using five testing single strand DNA (ssDNA) chains as proof-of-concepts, based on the glutaraldehyde modified liquid exfoliated graphene field effect transistor (LEG-FET). First of all, for the sake of identifying the 5mC site, the immunorecognition strategy is utilized and incorporated with LEG-FET working principle. That is, the methylation sites on testing ssDNA chains are first recognized by the fixed 5mC's antibody (5mCab) molecules on the channel of LEG-FET, then they are transduced to the varied current between the electrodes of drain and source (IDS). It is found, the changing ratios of IDS (ŒîIDS/IDS0) are in negative relation with the amount of 5mC sites (NmC) at each of the ssDNA concentrations (CssDNA). When CssDNA is varied from 1 to 106 pM, the slopes of the responding curves-ŒîIDS/IDS0 vs. NmC are increased from 0.54 to 3.70 %/NmC; meanwhile, at each of constant Nmc, the slopes of-ŒîIDS/IDS0 vs. CssDNA are also examined to proof the repeatability in DNA methylation detection.",60018038,Nankai University,Tianjin,China,['1706'],24.2,0.008658008658008663,0.417965367965368,1,0.08794788273615635,0.09120521172638436,0.445993031358885

After comparing the curve parameters, we verify that the performance of the source-based spectral calibration method is as good as the mercury argon lamp calibration method. The feasibility and accuracy of the new method are verified by fitting results, sensitivity map and imaging.

1548,1584,1584,Generalized single-sideband computer-generated holography for high-quality three-dimensional display," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Computer-generated holograms (CGHs) can be used to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) images without optical recording of the interference pattern. The conjugate image and zero-order beam have considerable influences on the optical reconstructions in computer-generated holographic display systems based on the amplitude spatial light modulators. Generalized single-sideband method is introduced for suppressing the unwanted terms in computer generated holography. Computer-generated holograms are calculated based on frequency filtering of the object wave, which redistributes the diffraction wave in spatial frequency domain for spectrum filtering during optical reconstruction. When the object wave on the hologram plane of the 3D scene is calculated, the single-sideband filter is addressed numerically after Fourier transform of the object wave. The filtered object wave can be calculated by inverse Fourier transform of the spectrum, and then it can be coded into the amplitude CGH. Different with the overlapped spatial frequency of the unfiltered CGH, the spectrum distributions of the object wave and the conjugate wave are located in the different sides of the spatial frequency domain with help of the single-sideband filter. By placing a single-sideband filter in Fourier plane, the conjugate image and the zero-order beam can be blocked during optical reconstruction. Since the proposed method directly processes the complex amplitude distribution of the object wave, it could be applied to various 3D CGH algorithms. Numerical simulations and optical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is generally effective for different kinds of CGH algorithms to reconstruct quality three-dimensional scenes that are free of conjugate image and zero-order beam.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,['1706'],26.0,0.11818181818181815,0.5590909090909091,0,0.10457516339869281,0.026143790849673203,0.2867383512544803

1550,1586,1586,Encoder-decoder approach to predict airport operational runway configuration: A case study for Amsterdam schiphol airport," All rights reserved.The runway configuration of an airport is the combination of runways that are active for arrivals and departures at any time. The runway configuration has a major influence on the capacity of the airport, taxiing times, the occupation of parking stands and taxiways, as well as on the management of traffic in the airspace surrounding the airport. The runway configuration of a given airport may change several times during the day, depending on the weather, air traffic demand and noise abatement rules, among other factors. This paper proposes an encoder-decoder model that is able to predict the future runway configuration sequence of an airport several hours upfront. In contrast to typical rule-based approaches, the proposed model is generic enough to be applied to any airport, since it only requires the past runway configuration history and the forecast traffic demand and weather in the prediction horizon.

This exercise specifically looked into single-person operations, where the ATCOs fulfilled the roles of conventional Planning Controllers and Executive Controllers. From a Human Performance perspective the main goals of the validation exercise were to collect controllers‚Äô feedback regarding i) the set-up of responsibilities and tasks allocated to them, ii) the impact of the changes in operating procedures on human performance, including controller‚Äôs trust, workload and situational awareness and finally, iii) assess the display design for presenting the Flight Centric airspace on the controller working position. The results clearly show that the new concept has significant impact on situational awareness. In order to support controllers, reliable and transparent Flight Centric-specific system support is essential, which has to be further refined.

In current stage, there is no specified biochemical drugs to regulate nuclear Ca2+ individually. The existence of nuclear Ca2+ store remains unknown. In this study, we show the femtosecond-laser stimulation can precisely regulate nuclear and other subcellular Ca2+ stores exclusively. The stimulated Ca2+ store can be released but other subcellular Ca2+ stores are not interfered by femtosecond laser. By using this method, we present the evidence of the endogenous Ca2+ store inside nucleus. The nuclear Ca2+ store volume and release mechanism are clarified. By photostimulation, nuclear Ca2+ store can be released and impact the calcium in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting a Ca2+ transmission channel between nucleus and ER. The permeability of nuclear pore complex (NPC) to Ca2+ at different Ca2+ levels is also found different.

Challenges remain in SRLM due to a long data acquisition time. To overcome the limitation, the methods based on compressed sensing (CS) have been proposed. However, at the current stage, the widely used sparsity-based localization methods, e.g., interior point method (IPM), is computationally intensive. To address the problem, in this paper, we introduce an alternative CS reconstruction method to super-resolution imaging model, which is achieved by using gOMP (generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit). A series of numerical simulations with varying emitter densities and signal-to-noise rations (SNRs) are performed to evaluate the performance of gOMP method. The results show that whatever gOMP or IPM is used in SRLM, the obtained localization accuracy is similar.

Currently, there is no report on the simultaneous detection of H2S gas and moisture content. In order to realize the accurate detection of H2S gas and H2O at the same time, Lorentz simulation analysis was performed on the absorption spectra of H2S gas and H2O molecules. The absorption was strongest near 2684nm, and there was no cross interference of SF6 other decomposition products. H2S and moisture content at different concentrations were measured by TDLAS technology in a customized CW-DFB laser with a central wavelength of 2.68Œºm combined with a small-volume Herriott long-range cell with multiple reflections.

1566,1602,1602,Multiplexing of distributed temperature sensing achieved by nanoparticle-doped fibers,"Distributed sensing based on Optical Backscattering Reflectometry (OBR) is a promising solution for medical applications, such as thermal ablation. OBR working principle is based on the change in pattern of small reflections from non-homogeneities inside the fiber as a response to applied strain and temperature. The advantage of OBR is its high resolution and sensitivity. However, since the scattering level is the same for standard single-mode fibers, OBR is unable to discriminate the pattern of different fibers when they are connected in parallel to a single channel. As a result, OBR detection is limited to a single sensing fiber and does not allow multiplexing. This work proposed a method to overcome the aforementioned limitation by the use of high-scattering fibers. Such fibers are achieved by doping their core with magnesium oxide particles, which size varies from 20 to 100 nm. The backscattering level of nanoparticles doped fiber (NPDF) is 50 dB higher than of the standard fibers. Four NPDFs have been spliced to the standard single-mode pigtails with different length to achieve four sensing regions located at different distances from pigtails. The NPDF sensors have been connected to the OBR equipment by the use of optical couplers and the backscattered pattern has shown four high-scattered sensing regions separated by low-scattering regions from standard fibers.

1567,1603,1603,Applicability of 3D Spectral Element Method for Computing Close-Range Underwater Piling Noises,"Pile driving is used for constructing foundation supports for offshore structures. Underwater noise, induced by in-water pile driving, could adversely impact marine life near the piling location. Many studies have computed this noise in close ranges by using semi-analytical models and Finite Element Method (FEM) models. This work presents a Spectral Element Method (SEM) wave simulator as an alternative simulation tool to obtain close-range underwater piling noise in complex, fully three-dimensional, axially-asymmetric settings in the time domain for impacting force signals with high-frequency contents (e.g., frequencies greater than 1000Hz). The presented numerical results show that the flexibility of SEM can accommodate the axially-asymmetric geometry of a model, its heterogeneity, and fluid-solid coupling. We showed that there are multiple Mach Cones of different angles in fluid and sediment caused by the difference in wave speeds in fluid, a pile, and sediment. The angles of Mach Cones in our numerical results match those that are theoretically evaluated. A previous work18 had shown that Mach Cone waves lead to intense amplitudes of underwater piling noise via a FEM simulation in an axis-symmetric setting. Since it modeled sediment as fluid with a larger wave speed than that of water, we examined if our SEM simulation, using solid sediment-fluid coupling, leads to additional Mach Cones. Because this work computes the shear wave in sediment and the downward-propagating shear wave in a pile, we present six Mach Cones in fluid and sediment induced by downward-propagating P- and S-waves in a pile in lieu of two previously-reported Mach Cones in fluid and sediment (modeled as fluid) induced by a downward-propagating P-wave in a pile. We also showed that the amplitudes of the close-range underwater noise are dependent on the cross-sectional geometry of a pile. In addition, when a pile is surrounded by a solid of an axially-asymmetric geometry, waves are reflected from the surface of the surrounding solid back to the fluid so that constructive and destructive interferences of waves take place in the fluid and affect the amplitude of the underwater piling noise.",60020444,Catholic University of America,"Washington, D.C.",United States,['1706'],28.08333333333333,0.00972222222222223,0.24444444444444435,1,0.1,0.06097560975609756,0.34139784946236557

However, the acquisition of holograms during experiments can be adversely affected by the speckle noise in coherent digital holographic systems. Several different denoising algorithms have been proposed. Traditional denoising algorithms average several holograms under different experimental conditions or use conventional filters to remove the speckle noise. However, these traditional methods require complex holographic experimental conditions. Besides time-consuming, the use of traditional neural networks has been difficult to extract speckle noise characteristics from holograms and the resulting holographic reconstructions have not been ideal. To address tradeoff between speckle noise reduction and efficiency, we analyze holograms in the spectrum domain for fast speckle noise reduction, which can remove multiple-levels speckle noise based on convolutional neural networks using only a single hologram. In order to effectively reduce the speckle noise associated with the hologram, the data set of the neural network training cannot use the current popular image data set. To achieve powerful noise reduction performance, neural networks use multiple-level speckle noise data sets for training. In contrast to existing traditional denoising algorithms, we use convolutional neural networks in spectral denoising for digital hologram. The proposed technique enjoys several desirable properties, including (i) the use of only a single hologram to efficiently handle various speckle noise levels, and (ii) faster speed than traditional approaches without sacrificing denoising performance. Experimental results and holographic reconstruction demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed neural network.",60027090,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,Blacksburg,United States,['1706'],21.0,0.07164502164502165,0.5283549783549782,0,0.13937282229965156,0.03484320557491289,0.3129496402877698

When the depth of the microgroove reaches a certain range, the general three-dimensional measurement method cannot be used since the depth of focus is usually not deep enough. In this paper, we proposed a new method of detecting based on the grating projection for detecting phase, which introduced a novel diffractive optical device called Dammann zone plate for measuring three-dimensional shape of tiny objects with an extend of focal length. Dammann grating can produce a finite array of uniform intensity spots in the Fourier transforming plane by modulating the transverse position of the transition points of the binary optical phase. Using this feature, the Dammann zone plate takes advantage of the periodic coding details of the Dammann grating for producing an axial multi-focus system with equal intensity in the focusing system when combined with a focusing lens. This experiment, the depth of focus is greatly extended due to the introduction of Dammann zone plate, which can measure deeper grooves. Therefore, we can collect more three-dimensional information of the tiny object with a CCD camera, and then we can obtain more accurate three-dimensional morphologic profile.

In the context of airport collaborative decision making, these data-driven approaches will allow cost efficient implementations, which are a key enabler for an appropriate integration of small/medium sized airports into the air transportation network. We propose an operational milestone concept based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance ‚Äì Broadcast messages emitted by approaching and departing aircraft. Since aircraft have to be equipped with a compliant transponder from 2020, airports only need cheap receivers to observe operations at the runway/taxiway system and at the apron (including parking positions). These observations will allow for a systematic monitoring (using operational milestones) and predictive analytics to provide estimated values for future system states. This contribution aims at providing a reliable basis to develop innovative approaches for small/medium airports, which are both beneficiary for the air transportation network and cost efficient for local operators. In this contribution, we process aircraft movements in the vicinity and on the ground of Gatwick airport and address our approach to provide an enhanced situational awareness.

As the population ages, osteoporosis has become a significant public health problem that threaten life quality of most countries in the world. Adequate vitamin D is able to improve intestinal calcium absorption, promote bone mineralization, maintain muscle strength, enhance balancing ability, and reduce fall risks, whichplays a vital role in bone metabolism. Moreover, vitamin D is mainly produced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The serum levels of 25(OH)D3 is the tools for estimating of the osteoporosis.It is known that vitamin D deficiency is ubiquitous in the elderly population, hence, we adopted UV light-emitting diode (UV-LED) instruments to generate narrow-range wavelengths of UV and determined its capability for producing vitamin D. The osteoporosis SD rats are our research subjects. The study was to investigate the effects of UV-LEDs of different power densities on vitamin D production. There are 4 groups 1/40.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8mW/cm2 and the rats (n = 6 per group) were irradiated with different power densities twice a week for a total of 8 weeks.

Picometer measurement is at first developed based on the simple two-beam interference, i.e., holography, combined with laser interferometer as a measurement standard. Normally, a laser interferometer could provide nanometer resolution. If we measure over 1000 periods of a high-density grating with nanometer resolution, then for one single period, the resolution might be obtained at picometer resolution. Since we can modulate the holography by changing the angle of two beams slightly, then its period can be measured at picometer accuracy. The difference between two slightly-changed periods can be controlled in picometer accuracy and used as a picometer measurement tool. This means we have the key to open the door of picooptics. Weak chaos principle is realized as one basic characteristics of picometer optical measurement, which is similar but different from the well-known Heisenberg uncertain measurement principle. Picometer measurement is illustrated based on using holographic techniques.

To obtain well-focused HRRP, the phase error induced by target velocity should be compensated, utilizing either measured or estimated target velocity. When the radar echo is under sampled, however, the HRRP will suffer from strong side and grid lobes, which deteriorates the performance of velocity estimation. A novel velocity estimation and compensation of high-speed target for under sampled data is proposed. The variational Bayesian inference based on the Laplacian scale mixture (LSM) prior is utilized to reconstruct HRRP with high resolution from the under sampled data.

The diffractive optical waveguide has obvious advantages over the geometric optical waveguide because of its high diffraction efficiency, light weight and difficulty in generating ghost images. Therefore, the use of holographic gratings as coupling elements for planar waveguides has been widely used in head-mounted display systems. Because high efficiency grating is required as coupling element in coupling, we use slanted trapezoidal surface relief grating as coupling element of the planar waveguide. In this paper, a slanted trapezoidal surface relief grating has been designed as a high-efficiency coupling element with a grating period of 520 nm and a material of BaK3 glass with a refractive index of 1.54. By optimizing the structure of the slanted grating, the relationship between the groove parameters and the diffraction efficiency of the slanted rectangular grating and the slanted trapezoidal grating is analyzed in detail.

However, it can be difficult to obtain the accurate number of neuronal cells in large-scale brain imaging, which is nearly inevitable with traditional image segmentation techniques due to the low contrast and noisy background. Here, we introduce a Docker-based deep convolutional neural network (DDeep3M) for better counting neurons in the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy images. To reconcile the memory limit of computational resource, a high-resolution 2D SRS image of whole coronal slice of mouse brain is divided into multiple patch images. Each patch image is then fed into the DDeep3M and predicted as a probability map. A higher contrast image targeting neurons (i.e. the predicted image) can be acquired by stitching the patches of probability map together. With this routine segmentation method applied in both raw SRS image and the predicted image, the DDeep3M achieves the accuracy of over 0.96 for cell counting which is much better than the result of traditional segmentation methods. Compared with the U-Net, which is one of the most popular deep learning networks for medical image segmentation, DDeep3M demonstrates a better result when handling such large-scale image.

1601,1638,1638,Reducing controller workload by automatic speech recognition assisted radar label maintenance," All rights reserved.Various new hard-and software centered methods were recently implemented to replace paper flight strips through modern technical solutions. These solutions provide valuable information for other ATM applications about the verbally given guidance instructions from air traffic controllers (ATCos), but also tend to increase ATCo workload. Speech recognition applications, which automatically recognize and input the verbal ATCo instructions into a technical flight strip solution, can compensate the workload increase while maintaining the benefit for other ATM applications. Experiments from the AcListant¬Æ project in 2015 have shown that Assistant Based Speech Recognition (ABSR), which combines a conventional speech recognizer with an assistant system, can provide adequate recognition quality for the use in air traffic control (ATC) applications. AcListant¬Æ used a prototypic radar display implementation and a research prototype of a speech recognizer. This paper describes the exercise 220 of the SESAR 2020 funded solution PJ.16-04. It used a Commer-cial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) speech recognition engine instead of a research prototype. Furthermore, a radar display developed by Thales Air Sys served for visualization. Command recognition rates varied greatly between 31% and 82% for different controllers. However, the concept from ABSR to predict possible ATCo instructions could be integrated with the COTS engine, which significantly decreased the command recognition error rate and led to a variation between only 4.8% and 6.6%, i.e. only a small amount of false recognitions were shown to the ATCo.",60007798,Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- Und Raumfahrt,Cologne,Germany,['1706'],21.0,0.007046657046657052,0.4997234247234247,0,0.1079136690647482,0.07194244604316546,0.3893129770992366

Therefore, this paper designs to utilize multiple neural networks in two stages to discriminately learn a certain type of noise features and reduce the introduction of interference.

Starch-coated Ag-NPs with an average diameter of 15.4¬±3.9 nm were successfully synthesized through a simple green method using D-glucose as reducing agent and soluble starch as protecting polymer. The synthesized silver nanoparticles showed a strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band around 408 nm and linearly decreasing intensity of LSPR band with increasing concentration of Fe(III) in hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (pH ‚àº3). Based on the linear relationship between LSPR intensity and concentration of Fe3+ ions, the as-synthesized starch-coated silver nanoparticles could be used as a smart optical probe for sensitive and selective detection of Fe3+ ions in water with a linear range from 0.7 to 7 mg/L Fe3+ and detection limit of 0.1 mg/L; the relative standard deviation values varied between 2 and 6 % for the whole calibration range. Experiments performed demonstrated that the metal ions Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Fe2+ do not interfere, due to the absence of oxidative activity of these ions, which guarantees the high selectivity of the proposed optical sensor toward Fe3+ ions in aqueous samples.

Otherwise their virtual solution is not guarantee it is a physical science. One of the important conditions must be the causality condition (i.e., t>0) for which to confirm a solution is temporal and existed within our universe. Since the entire fundamental laws of science are mathematics, which includes the Maxwell equations, as well the Schr√∂dinger equation, without the imposition of causality condition we are not sure that the solution is a physically real science within our universe. Since we have shown Schr√∂dinger quantum mechanics is timeless, we will show what would happen if his timeless superposition principle is plunging within a temporal space.

Our paper is dedicated to diffractive optics, which is produced by circular laser writing on CLWS-300. In the process of fabrication of diffractive element, a pre-calculated pattern is written on the optical substrate. During this process, writing errors occur that can introduce distortions into the wavefront generated by diffractive optical element. The error of the angular coordinate can make the most significant contribution to the total error. In addition, this type of error is the most difficult to control and correct. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the angular coordinate error of the circular laser writing systems based on laser interferometry. The method includes writing special test samples and their subsequent control using a conventional Fizeau interferometer. The angular coordinate error is calculated from the phase map. This method allows detecting errors of the angular coordinates up to 1-2 ang. sec. The test pattern can also be written on the same substrate within a single fabrication process with main pattern. This allows certification and quality control of the fabricated diffractive optical element. In addition, laser writing system can be periodically tested to verify that angular coordinate error is within acceptable limits.

It is based on the data of the Ru-RSTreebank annotated within the framework of the Rhetorical Structure theory [Mann, Thompson 1988]. The research question is what cue phrases and lexical and grammatical patterns are used to express the Contrast relation as opposed to the Comparison relation.

Visual inspection of reconstructed phase difference maps of air field surrounding the heat sink at a different time provide the qualitative information of temperature variation trend of air field surrounding the heat sink during the heat dissipation process. Quantitative information of temperature distribution surrounding the heat sink is obtained from the relationship between the digitally reconstructed phase difference map of ambient air and heated air.

1626,1663,1663,An enrichment method for mapping ambiguous reads to the reference genome for NGS analysis,"Mapping short reads to a reference genome is an essential step in many next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses. In plants with large genomes, a large fraction of the reads can align to multiple locations of the genome with equally good alignment scores. How to map these ambiguous reads to the genome is a challenging problem with big impacts on the downstream analysis. Traditionally, the default method is to assign an ambiguous read randomly to one of the many potential locations. In this study, we explore two alternative methods that are based on the hypothesis that the possibility of an ambiguous read being generated by a location is proportional to the total number of reads produced by that location: (1) the enrichment method that assigns an ambiguous read to the location that has produced the most reads among all the potential locations, (2) the probability method that assigns an ambiguous read to a location based on a probability proportional to the number of reads the location produces. We systematically compared the performance of the proposed methods with that of the default random method. Our results showed that the enrichment method produced better results than the default random method and the probability method in the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

1631,1668,1668,Energy-efficient clustering method for wireless sensor networks using modified gravitational search algorithm,"Past decades have witnessed the advancement of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in both academic and industrial communities. Clustering is one of the most popular methods to increase the lifespan of WSNs. The optimal number of cluster heads and how to organize the clusters are the most important issues to be addressed in the clustering methods. In this paper, we proposed a novel user-independent and dynamical method to calculate the optimal number of clusters, organize the clusters, and determine the best cluster heads in each round. In this method, efficient energy consumption and link quality were considered to compute the optimal number of clusters. Then, the algorithm began to organize the compact clusters with high energy level cluster heads. We investigated a new fitness function in order to achieve these objectives. A new version of gravitational search algorithm (GSA) was used to solve this optimization problem. In this algorithm, the power distance sums scaling method was applied to calculate the mass values. Then, a fuzzy logic controller is employed to identify the parameter of this algorithm to control the exploitation and exploration abilities of the method during the computational process of the algorithm. Then, the novel version of GSA was applied to reach an appropriate solution for the fitness function, find the optimal number of clusters, and properly organize these clusters. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, several experiments were performed and the obtained results were compared with the results of other popular clustering methods. The simulation results revealed that the performance of the modified GSA was better than other state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithms.

1632,1669,1669,"Analysis of relationship between air traffic demand, safety and complexity in FABEC airspace"," All rights reserved.Air traffic performance of the European air traffic system depends not only on traffic demand but also on airspace structure and its traffic distribution. These structural (airspace structure) and flow characteristics (factors such as traffic volume, climbing/descending traffic, mix of aircraft type, military area activity) influence airspace complexity, which can affect controller workload and influence the probability of safety occurrence. In other words, all these dynamic and static complexity components can potentially have an impact upon the safety of the air traffic management (ATM) system. Having in mind fluctuation in traffic on daily, seasonal or annual level in certain airspace, a few questions arise: is there any correlation between traffic demand, safety and complexity and are there any differences between seasons? For that purpose, an investigation is performed on FAB Europe Central (FABEC) airspace, based on two weeks of operated traffic during the summer and fall of 2017. Air traffic complexity is estimated using the EUROCONTROL complexity metrics, while conflict risk is assessed using the conflict risk assessment simulation tool. FABEC analysis served as a test case of how performance indicators (existing and the new ones), could be used to asses operational and safety performance, and hence advantages and benefits of operational changes/concepts such as Free Rote Airspace (FRA). Moreover, this case study was used to set a benchmark for further assessment of potential benefits of operational environment changes in airspace due to implementation of FRA. Results show that certain positive relationship exists between traffic demand, conflict risk and complexity.

Since the polarized digital holography can reconstruct the residual stress in high resolution, fast speed and high accuracy, the proposed method can be a potential tool in laser damage detection and laser repairing quality evaluation in high power laser fields.",60007029,Jiangnan University,Wuxi,China,['1706'],34.5,0.07346153846153848,0.5303846153846153,0,0.13333333333333333,0.006666666666666667,0.2108843537414966
1635,1672,1672,Hand gesture recognition based on range Doppler-angle trajectory and LSTM network using an MIMO radar,"Touchless hand gesture recognition is of great importance for human-computer interaction (HCI). In this paper, we present a hand gesture recognition approach based on range-Doppler-angle trajectory and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network with a 77GHz frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar. Firstly, the hand gesture fast-time-slow-time-antenna 3 dimension (3D) data are collected by the FMCW MIMO radar. Additionally, by performing the discretize Fourier transform (DFT) to the fast-time and slow-time, respectively, we obtain the range-profile and Doppler-profile. Then, by using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) approach, we estimate the angle-profile of the hand gestures. To smooth and eliminate the noise effects, we apply the Kalman filtering to the estimated range-profile, Doppler-profile and angle-profile, respectively, and obtain the range-Doppler-angle trajectory signature. After that, by exploiting the temporal and spatial correlations, we construct a LSTM network for the hand gesture recognition. Experiments with 6 hand gestures are conducted and show that the proposed approach can recognize 6 hand gestures with an average accuracy over 97%.",60000937,Shenzhen University,Shenzhen,China,['1706'],20.75,0.1388888888888889,0.287037037037037,1,0.0860655737704918,0.040983606557377046,0.4306930693069307

The cascaded QDFs are fabricated by the 3D printing technology and can be divided into two parts QDF1 and QDF2. When the excitation light is coupled into the fiber, the QDF1 emits the 630nm fluorescence and the QDF2 emits the 530nm fluorescence. Because the fluorescence peaks will change with the temperature linearly, it can be used as the fiber temperature sensor. In the experiment, by controlling the temperature at each QDF, the sensor realizes the temperature measurement at different position. The sensitivity of the sensor at different position is 0.15nm/¬∞C and 0.153nm/¬∞C, respectively. The results verify the feasibility of the structure for distributed temperature sensing.

In the holographic display, both display systems and encoding methods of computergenerated hologram have effects on the reconstructed image quality.

However, it is still a challenging task for direct detection of 1O2 by using an optical system as its extremely weak luminescence at 1270 nm. In previous study, a high-sensitivity optical fiber detection system has been developed to measure the time-resolved 1O2 luminescence spectra. In this study, an optical phantom of skin tissue has been built to simulate the skin optical properties for research in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The phantom consists of an absorber (ink) and a scatterer (Intralipid) and phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Rose Bengal (RB) was utilized as the model photosensitizer to generate 1O2. The time-resolved 1O2 luminescence spectroscopy were measured by using a 1O2 luminescence detection system with a fiber prober in tissue phantom. Furthermore, the effect of absorption coefficient (Œºa) and scattering coefficient (Œºs) on the photosensitizer triple state lifetime (œÑT) and 1O2 luminescence lifetime (œÑD) was investigated as well. The results indicated that the integrated intensity of 1O2 luminescence decrease with the increase of Œºa and Œºs. Œºa has no significant effect on œÑT and œÑD. œÑT increase with the increase of Œºs, and it finally stabilized around 1.6 Œºs. Meanwhile, œÑD decrease firstly and then increase slowly, and it finally stabilized around 14 Œºs.

In our study were measured 5 mm-thick plates of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) implanted with silicon ions (Si+) accelerated to a relatively low energy of 50 keV at Si+ fluence of 1016 ions/cm2. Due to ion-produced destruction of the polymer network and reorganization of the organic structure in a depth of PMMA plate, a buried ion-modified layer with ‚àº 80 nm thickness is formed within the PMMA. The material in this ultra-thin nano-sized layer beneath the top surface of PMMA (in a depth of ‚àº 100 nm) is organized in carbon nanoclusters with a mean size of about 2-3 nm. The nonlinear gradual in-depth distribution of the complex refractive index in the nanostructured region of the polymer results in a significant modification of the reflection of coherent light by the formed structure. Also, the reflected beam undergoes a strong laser-induced photothermal interface lensing upon irradiation by CW laser (Œª= 532 nm) with an optical power above 30 mW.

Time-gated capability is realized by using a 405-nm continuous wave diode laser for excitation and an optical chopper to mechanically synchronize phases of both excitation and detection beams, which circumvents the use of typically expensive pulsed light sources and image intensifier. A commercial CMOS camera is used to collect bright filed imaging, non-time-gated fluorescence imaging, and time-gated fluorescence imaging. To demonstrate time-gated imaging capability of the system, silicon quantum dot nanoparticles (SiQDNPs), with long fluorescence lifetime of about 16 Œºs, is used as biocompatible probes to help remove background autofluorescence usually with shorter lifetime in the order of nanoseconds. Compared with non-time-gated fluorescence imaging mode, the time-gated fluorescence imaging mode achieves over 300-fold enhancement in SBR by imaging of a phantom of SiQDNPs with FITC as background. For in vivo imaging, zebrafish embryos and GFP transgenic zebrafish larvae microinjected with SiQDNPs are imaged. Nearly all background autofluorescence signal emitted from the embryo and the larvae is suppressed in the time-gated mode, which yields great improvement in SBR. Furthermore, signals emitted from the SiQDNPs probe can be separated from the undesired fluorescence emitted from the yolk sac and the transgenic zebrafish larvae through the proposed time-resolved method.

The resulting scores provide solid comparison baselines for future studies tackling similar tasks.

1655,1693,1693,Microscopic urinalysis by digital holographic microscopy," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Urine analysis (urinalysis) is a critical component to diagnose urinary tract disease. Microscopic evaluation of the urine provides an insight into potential underlying urinary tract disease, which is used for identification and characterization of both common and much less common formed elements in the urine sample. In this paper, the microscopic urinalysis is presented by using single beam digital holographic microscopy (DHM). This is a common path set up wherein both beams (reference and sample) travel through a similar path providing higher temporal stability. In this paper, phasecontrast three - dimensional imaging of red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), squamous and nonsquamous epithelial cells, casts and various crystals present in the urine samples, have been demonstrated. The proposed imaging modality for the diagnosis of urinary tract disease is simple, non-contact, non-invasive, and provides higher temporal stability due to its common-path geometry.",60032730,Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,New Delhi,India,['1706'],25.5,-0.04239417989417989,0.3618386243386244,0,0.08021390374331551,0.016042780748663103,0.3202247191011236

1657,1695,1695,Direct laser writing of high-NA computer-generated holograms on metal films of the titanium group and chromium," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Computer-generated holograms are widely used in interferometry for aspherical mirror testing. However, CGH has relatively low numerical aperture, which is limited both by the spatial resolution of the manufacturing process and by the need to do the design in a frame of the rigorous diffraction theory. As a result, the typical minimum period for phase CGH is limited to about 2 Œºm, if a wavefront error does not exceed Œª/20. It limits now f/number at value of f/1.5 for 633 nm wavelength. In this paper we discuss the technology of direct laser writing on metal films of the titanium group and chromium. It allows one to fabricate microstructures with a period of up to 1 Œºm at 0.7 Œºm spot size. Thermochemical effects of laser radiation on the films of various metals have been studied for a long time. The spatial resolution of thermochemical writing on metal films can be significantly improved by through oxidation, which dramatically increases negative feedback at light absorption. The study of laser writing on Zr and Ti films demonstrated their future promise for the technology of creating computer-generated holograms. However, the technology of laser through-oxidation is limited by relatively low scanning speeds of up to 500 mm/s. It limits CGH size when using circular scanning of the laser beam. Reactive ion etching of Ti films through the laser-induced oxide mask can be used to fabricate binary phase structures. The technology is studied for producing diffractive transmission spheres (TS) with an aperture of up to f/0.75.",60033230,Institute of Automation and Electrometry of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences,Novosibirsk,Russian Federation,['1706'],20.0,0.002936507936507939,0.3752380952380953,0,0.09152542372881356,0.02711864406779661,0.28214285714285714

The linguist's view on the surrogate of contexts on the corpus, as which vector models can be considered, makes it possible to reveal new information about the distribution of individual semantic groups of vocabulary and new knowledge about the corpus from which these models are derived. In particular, it is shown that such layers of English and Russian vocabulary, such as the names of professions, nationalities, toponyms, personal qualities, time periods, have the greatest independence from changing the model and retain their position relative to their neighbour words‚Äîthat is, they have the most stable contexts regardless of the corpus; it is shown that the vocabulary from the Swadesh list is statistically more resistant to changing the model than the frequency vocabulary is; it is shown which word2vec models for the Russian language preserve best the ontological structures in vocabulary.",60020513,National Research University Higher School of Economics,Moscow,Russian Federation,['1706'],58.66666666666666,0.2178628389154705,0.38775917065390747,0,0.07614213197969544,0.02030456852791878,0.25
1659,1697,1697,Study on processing of infrared thermogram of ankle soft tissue injury with LDA based on DCT transform,"The currentI1/4infrared thermal imaging technology provides a new method for the detection of various soft tissue parts in human body, but the research on soft tissue lesion of ankle joint by infrared thermography is not very extensive. With the maturity of this technology and the improvement of pattern recognition and digital image processing algorithm, the analysis of infrared thermal image has been improved. The principle of infrared thermal imaging technology is to display the infrared signal sent by human body in the form of temperature distribution, and the change of temperature will cause the pathological changes of human tissue. In this paper, by taking a large number of infrared thermal images under appropriate conditions, the infrared thermal image is preprocessed by de-noising and other operations, and the temperature information on the infrared thermal image is converted into data sequence information. Since the discrete cosine transform (DCT) has a relatively mature fast algorithm, it can effectively solve the problem of large computational complexity. Therefore, the discrete cosine transform is used to reduce the dimensionality of the infrared thermal image. Then, using the feature extraction process of Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm, we seek a best projection direction to compress high-dimensional features into one-dimensional features, and then use Fisher's linear discriminant analysis algorithm to obtain the discriminant function after the projection of the training samples. The experimental results determine whether the test sample belongs to the damaged ankle soft tissue or not. Then, the soft tissue damage site of the sample is judged.",60025094,Hebei University of Science and Technology,Shijiazhuang,China,['1706'],28.0,0.16699675324675328,0.3421549284049284,1,0.08098591549295775,0.02112676056338028,0.21942446043165467

1663,1701,1701,The intraocular lens based on Dammann zone plate," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Nowadays, more and more people worldwide suffer from cataracts, an eye disease. The intraocular lens is a precise optical component, which can be implanted into the eyes through the surgery to replace the turbid lens of eyes with the target of providing good vision correction for many cataract patients. Scientists have developed many types of intraocular lenses for correcting vision of cataract patients, but many of them have slightly poor imaging effect because of fewer axial focal points. Dammann zone plate is a very useful optical element, which is formed by introducing the phase modulation of Dammann grating into Fresnel zone plate. The characters of Dammann zone plate enable it to produce a series of axial focal spots distribution with equal intensity in a certain range. In this paper, we introduced Dammann zone plate into the traditional intraocular lens and designed a kind of intraocular lens. And we mainly researched the focusing depth and imaging effect. We find that the intraocular lens with deeper focal depth and better imaging effect can be obtained by the optimal combination of the two parts. This multifocal intraocular lenses enable both the near and far objects to focus on the retina. With the Dammann zone plate, the intraocular lens has deeper focal depth, which allows those cataract patients to get a better visual clarity and can provides better visual quality for them. Therefore, this design has a wide prospect for the treatment of cataract in the future.",60017456,Jinan University,Guangzhou,China,['1706'],23.0,0.25083809523809525,0.4531904761904762,0,0.09090909090909091,0.025454545454545455,0.24632352941176472
1664,1702,1702,Identification of macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment using label-free multiphoton microscopy,"Macrophages are at the center of the invasion and play a protumoral role in the tumor microenvironment. They can facilitate angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, invasion and migration of cancer cells, while inhibit the antitumoral immune surveillance. Tumor-associated macrophages are a major component of malignant tumors, which can stimulate the progress of tumors. In many human cancers, the presence of macrophages in tumor microenvironment has been correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, visual diagnosis of macrophages in tumor microenvironment is great significance for us to comprehend the occurrence and progress of tumor. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) with subcellular resolution based on second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) is very suitable for real-time detecting morphological and structural changes in biological tissues without tissue staining and exogenous probe molecule. In this study, we describe the use of label-free MPM for analyzing the intratumoral distribution and morphological changes of macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment. Our results indicated that MPM can accurately identify macrophages in breast tumor tissues. MPM images were well consistent hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images.

The diffraction grating with high diffraction efficiency and high laser damage threshold is the key component in a spectral-beam-combining laser system. To meet the above requirements, we design a grating on top of a high-reflectivity HfO2/SiO2 thin-film stack. The diffraction efficiency of the grating depends mainly on the duty cycle and depth of the grating grooves. The grating was fabricated by using optical interference lithography and reactive ion beam etching. To achieve high efficiency, we controlled the duty cycle by applying an end-point detection technique during development and we controlled the groove depth by adjusting the ion-beam etching time length. In a 50 mm √ó 50 mm fabricated grating area, the measured diffraction efficiency in TE polarization was 95.8 ¬± 1.1 % at the center wavelength of 1030 nm.
