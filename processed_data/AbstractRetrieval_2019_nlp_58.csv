1,1,TCP with Network Coding Performance Under Packet Reordering,"The adverse impact of packet reordering besides packet loss is significant on the goodput performance of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), a dominant protocol for reliable and connection-oriented transmission. With the primary purpose of improving the TCP goodput in lossy networks, the Network Coding technique was introduced. TCP/NC (TCP with Network Coding) is a promising approach which can recover lost packets without retransmission. However, the packet reordering has not been considered, and no study on that issue is found for TCP/NC. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the goodput performance degradation due to the out-of-order reception of data or acknowledgment packets and propose a new scheme for TCP/NC to estimate and adapt to the packet reordering. The results of our simulation on ns-3 (Network Simulation 3) suggest that the proposed scheme can maintain the TCP goodput well in a wide range of packet reordering environments compared to TCP NewReno as well as TCP/NC.",60031838,Kyushu Institute of Technology,Kitakyushu,Japan,"['1706', '1705', '1710']",25.333333333333332,0.14772727272727273,0.5174242424242425,1
2,2,Understanding Students Personality to Detect Their Learning Differences,"Students have different levels of intellectual capabilities and learning styles which affect their understanding of specific academic concepts and gaining specific skills. Educational institutions dedicate much efforts to support at-risk students. However, this support usually comes as a reaction of students’ low performance, while learners need proactive support to keep their academic performance high, this needs a deep understanding of students learning capabilities and the real support they need accordingly. This research tries to investigate students’ personalities and the impact of learners’ personalities on their academic capabilities. A sample of 180 students was involved in this pilot study to evaluate the impact of their personalities on their academic standing.

It is considered to be the next big thing in the evolution of the Internet and an integral part of the future Internet. IoT devices that have their own storage and processing capabilities can process and store data at their end. However, the devices which don’t have storage and processing resources, like sensors attached to the patient’s body, collect data from the physical environment and send to some sink for processing and storage. Such sensors generate a huge amount of data, so there is a need to process and store the data efficiently. However, the cloud computing which is used as a platform for IoT has an inherent problem of latency which can cause bad monitoring and patients which need an immediate treatment can be affected. This problem can be considered in every latency sensitive application which requires real-time monitoring and processing. To solve such problems, we need a new platform for IoT related data which offers the same services as a cloud but do not have problems like a cloud. This study proposes a new solution for IoT patient’s data which utilizes an intermediate layer, fog computing with cloud computing, and accelerates the awareness and response to events by removing a round trip delay to the cloud for analysis. It also offloads the gigabytes of network traffic from the core network to the local edge fog network. This work also proposes how energy efficient sensing will be done.

28,28,A Synchronization Protocol to Prevent Illegal Information Flow Based on Maximal Roles in the Role-Based Access Control Model,"In access control models, a transaction is allowed to read and write an object only if access rights to read and write the object are granted, respectively. Suppose a transaction reads data d from a file object and then writes the data d to another file object. Here, another transaction can get the data d by reading the file object even if is not granted a read right on the file object. Here, information in the file object flows to the transaction via the file object. We have to prevent illegal information flow to occur by transactions manipulating objects. The role-based access control (RBAC) model is widely used in various applications like database systems. In our previous studies, the legally precedent relation from a role to a role is defined. However, even if the legal condition is satisfied, there is case illegal information flow occurs. In this paper, we redefine legal and illegal precedent relations among roles. In order to check if a collection A of roles illegally precedes a collection B of roles, we introduce a new condition which uses maximal roles of A and B.",60030526,Hosei University,Tokyo,Japan,"['1706', '1705', '1710']",18.7,-0.049639249639249636,0.4504617604617605,1

Hence, the NDN technology realizing content centric forwarding instead of location centric forwarding among end-to-end nodes, attracts much attentions by network operators. The key technology of the NDN is to utilize the in-network caches of past forwarded contents. The size of the cache buffer is however, limited by the hardware constraint. So, cached contents are frequently dequeued on content routers belonging to the paths where large number of contents passing over. This dequeue deteriorates cache hit rate and performance of NDN, also. Therefore, in this paper, we propose new contents migration method for reducing network traffic and improving cache hit rate by migrating popular contents to content router close to the content requesters.

Great examples are Twitter-based earthquake detection, Influenza detection, and traffic abnormally detection. Following the same viewpoint of the human-powered sensing network, in this paper, we discover the utility of user-generated social texts on social media platform for extracting highlights and annotating the semantics of sport video clips. The basic idea for the leverage of social text is that one can make use of the semantics of the social texts for understanding the corresponding moments of the game. For example, when watching a baseball, the users on social media will timely comments about the play, the team, and the events. By properly analyzing the texts, automatically annotating the sport videos turns out to be possible. However, two research challenges need to be addressed for such an idea: (1) as sport videos are often lengthy, how to precisely locate the moment of important events is a challenge task, (2) social media contents are generated by users on social network platform and contains various information and with noises, and therefore how to distill useful information from noisy social comment is also a challenge. In this paper, we present a weighting scheme to address the issues by estimating the importance of users (and therefore their comments) on social network platforms based on mining the interaction between users on social platforms.

Cryptography is one of the significant area to support network security, including converting data into encrypted message. AES is a symmetric cryptographic algorithm which is faster with excellent security and less memory computations. Even though AES consumes significantly low power, it has side channel attack which relies on the power analysis of the cryptosystem. Reversible logic has been evolved over the time with significant reduction in power dissipation. So side channel attack can be addressed with reversible logic implementation.

71,71,Evaluating Indoor Location Triangulation Using Wi-Fi Signals,"The advancement in Global Positioning System (GPS), has led to a huge number of location-based applications. Such applications can also be very useful for indoor environment; however, GPS technology struggles with indoor location mapping. Currently, there are various techniques, which are used for indoor localization namely: wireless fidelity-based, Bluetooth, radio frequency identification (RFID), infrared beam, and Sensors. The Wi-Fi access points (APs) are installed at various indoor locations to cover most of the areas, and the smart phones and tablets, are equipped with wireless transceiver modules, which can receive Wi-Fi signals. Therefore, it becomes more practical to use Wi-Fi signal for such application in comparison to infrared beam, Bluetooth and other wireless technologies, as Wi-Fi has significant advantages, including wider range, higher stability, and there are no requirements for additional hardware devices. Literature review confirms that the non-line of sight (NLOS) factors and the multipath effect easily affects most of the existing indoor localization algorithms based on Wi-Fi access points (APs). There also exist many other problems, such as positioning stability and blind spots, which can cause a decline in positioning accuracy at certain positions or even failure of positioning. In this research, we propose to use triangulation of location based on Wi-Fi signals from multiple APs. This method utilizes the received signal strength indications (RSSI) from multiple static APs to determine the location. Based on this, evaluation is done using experiments to measure the accuracy and effectiveness of the new proposed algorithm. The results are promising and can be improved with the use of Artificial intelligence, which is the future work of this project.

85,85,Performance analysis of A*-Based hop selection technique in opportunistic networks through movement mobility models,"In recent times, it has been observed that opportunistic networks (OPPNET) are attracted by many researchers. The reason behind it is that no end-to-end connectivity exists and still the messages are communicated from the source to destination in this network. This is because, this network uses the node’s mobility for routing and hence selection of mobility models are considered very crucial while evaluating the movement of the nodes in any routing protocol. Appropriate selection of a mobility model is important for evaluating the performance of the protocol and secondly, to substantiate its applicability in the real-world scenario. This chapter analyzes the impact that three specific mobility models (namely SPMBM, RWP, and RTT) have on the performance of the existing A*OR protocol for OppNets using average hop count, delivered messages, number of message dropped, overhead ratio, and average latency as performance metrics. A suitable environment is set up using ONE simulator for simulating the A*OR protocol over different movement models. Experimental results show significant variations in the performance of A*OR for the SPMBM, RWP, and RTT. In terms of delivery predictability, the SPMBMM model is 80% better than RWP and 90% than RTT. The average latency of the SPMBMM model is 16% better than RWP and 59% than RTT when TTL varies in the network.",60029284,University of Delhi,New Delhi,India,"['1706', '1705', '1710']",23.77777777777778,0.15147058823529413,0.5235294117647059,1

However, a common problem of the methods is that the physical (PHY) layer operations are not considered. As a result, existing methods may find difficulties in real-world implementation. In this paper, we propose a simple but practical uplink scheme to solve the problem. The main idea is to perform multi-user beamforming (MUBF) at the access point. The advantage of the proposed method is that while the uplink throughput can be effectively improved, the MAC protocol of the original IEEE 802.11 standard remains unchanged. With the proposed method, simultaneous and asynchronous reception of signals from multiple users can be conducted, and the uplink channel collision probability can be reduced. A closed-form solution for the saturation throughput is also derived.

98,98,Segmenting snow scene from CCTV using deep learning approach," All rights reserved.Recently, data from many sensors has been used in a disaster monitoring of things, such as river water levels, rainfall levels, and snowfall levels. These types of numeric data can be straightforwardly used in a further analysis. In contrast, data from CCTV cameras (i.e. images and/or videos) cannot be easily interpreted for users in an automatic way. In a traditional way, it is only provided to users for a visualization without any meaningful interpretation. Users must rely on their own expertise and experience to interpret such visual information. Thus, this paper proposes the CNN-based method to automatically interpret images captured from CCTV cameras, by using snow scene segmentation as a case example. The CNN models are trained to work on 3 classes: snow, non-snow and non-ground. The non-ground class is explicitly learned, in order to avoid a confusion of the models in differentiating snow pixels from non-ground pixels, e.g. sky regions. The VGG-19 with pre-trained weights is retrained using manually labeled snow, non-snow and non-ground samples. The learned models achieve up to 85% sensitivity and 97% specificity of the snow area segmentation.",60024621,National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,Tokyo,Japan,"['1710', '1705']",15.416666666666666,0.21893939393939393,0.5871212121212122,0

109,109,On the security of a cca-secure timed-release conditional proxy broadcast re-encryption scheme,"Proxy re-encryption acts an important role in secure data sharing in cloud storage. There are many variants of proxy re-encryption until now, in this paper we focus on the timed-realise conditional proxy broadcast re-encryption. In this primitive, if and only the condition and time satisfied the requirement, the proxy can re-encrypt the delegator(broadcast encryption set)’s ciphertext to be the delegatee(another broadcast encryption set)’s ciphertext. Chosen cipertext security (CCA-security) is an important security notion for encryption scheme. In the security model of CCA-security, the adversary can query the decryption oracle to get help, with the only restriction the challenge ciphertext can not be queried to the decryption oracle. For CCA-security of time-realised conditional proxy broadcast re-encryption, the situation is more complicated for this time the adversary can not only get the decryption oracle of normal ciphertext but also the decryption oracle of the re-encrypted ciphertext and the re-encrypted key generation oracle. In 2013, Liang et al. proposed a CCA-secure time-realised conditional proxy broadcast re-encryption scheme, in this paper, we show their proposal is not CCA-secure in the security model of CCA-secure time-realised conditional proxy broadcast re-encryption.",60112572,Xijing University,Xi'an,China,"['1706', '1705', '1710']",23.125,0.19583333333333333,0.8541666666666666,1

Information in a peer illegally flows to a peer if an event message published by the peer carries an object on some topics into the target peer, which is not allowed to subscribe the topics. In our previous studies, a TOBS (topics of objects-based synchronization) protocol is proposed to prevent illegal information flow in the P2PPSO system. In the TOBS protocol, an illegal object whose topics a target peer is not allowed to subscribe is not delivered to the target peer. In this paper, we evaluate the TOBS protocol in terms of the number of event messages including at least one illegal object.

The sensor nodes have responsibility to sense an event and send information towards an actor node. The actor node is responsible to take prompt decision and react accordingly. In order to provide effective sensing and acting, a distributed local coordination mechanism is necessary among sensors and actors. In this work, we consider the actor node selection problem and propose a fuzzy-based system (FBS) that based on data provided by sensors and actors selects an appropriate actor node. We use 4 input parameters: Number of Sensors per Actor (NSA), Distance to Event (DE), Remaining Energy (RE) and Actor Reliability (AR) as new parameter. The output parameter is Actor Selection Decision (ASD). Considering NSA parameter, the ASD has better values when NSA is medium. Thus, when the NSA value is 0.5 the load is distributed better and in this situation the possibility for the actor to be selected is high.

The lifetime of a sensor network is an important issue because it represents that how the area is monitored and under control. When the energy of sensors is sufficient, the sensor network is available because the monitored events can be sent to the sinks. When some sensors are unavailable due to the lack of energy, the lifetime of the network ends. If there exist energy supporting in partial area, exploiting the partial energy supporting to replenish the sensors in the entire environment may extend the monitoring lifetime. To monitor the environment efficiently and extend the monitoring lifetime, we propose a cooperating mechanism to replenish sensors in the heterogeneous sensor networks. In the mechanism, the sensors may be static sensing only, static sensing with energy transmitting, or mobile sensing with energy transmitting.

But a lot has changed since then and most mainstream political parties have now adapted to social media, especially Twitter. All the top national, state level parties and their leaders have opened social media accounts including Twitter to interact with users on the social media platform. Twitter is now being prominently used as a tool for political communication in India through which political leaders directly reach out to their voters and supporters. Though Narendra Modi is still the most popular political leader on Twitter by far with over 50 million followers, other top opposition leaders started gaining noticeable traction by 2017. After much introspection and reluctance, the Congress revamped its blueprint for political communication and started using Twitter aggressively to win back voters.

First, RRS examples are generated by the convolution method using convolution calculus between the Gaussian spectral and impulse functions. Second, optical rays along RRS are computed by using the ray tracing method based on Dijkstra’s algorithm (DA). Third, propagation orders of distances are statistically calculated by using the traced rays along RRS weighted with the newly introduced coefficients for multiple diffractions. The weighting function is derived from the asymptotic form of the complex type of Fresnel function.

164,164,IDBP: A distributed min-cut density-balanced algorithm for incremental web-pages ranking,"A link analysis on a distribute system is a viable choice to evaluate relationships between web-pages in a large web-graph. Each computational processor in the system contains a partial local web-graph and it locally performs web ranking. Since a distributed web ranking is generally incur penalties on execution times and accuracy from data synchronization, a web-graph can preliminary partitioned with a desired structure before a link analysis algorithm is started to improve execution time and accuracy. However, in the real-word situation, the numbers of web-pages in the web-graph can be continuously increased. Therefore, a link analysis algorithm has to re-partition a web-graph and re-perform web-pages ranking every time when the new web-pages are collected. In this paper, an efficient distributed web-pages ranking algorithm with min-cut density-balanced partitioning is proposed to improve the execution time of this scenario. The algorithm will re-partition the web-graph and re-perform the web-pages ranking only when necessary.

Interpolation method and frequency response masking (FRM) technique minimize required multipliers and additions in proposed nonuniform FIR-DFB. The performances of the filter and DFB are improved by optimizing filter coefficients and gain in each subband. The proposed FIR-DFB with stop band attenuation of 60 dB can be implemented with only ten multipliers and ten subfilters. In this paper, an effort has been made to reduce a computational cost and simulation work conducted on optimized magnitude response of proposed DFB.

In division based broadcasting, although several researchers have proposed scheduling methods to reduce the waiting time for delivering multiple video, they failed to consider cases where the data size of each video is not the same. In division based broadcasting systems, we have proposed a scheduling method that delivers multiple video called multiple-video broadcasting method considering data size (MV-D). The MV-D method divides the data and produces an effective broadcasting schedule based on the data size of each video.

Each node in the network select a subset of its 1 hop neighbors known as Multi Point Relays (MPR) which reduces the redundant retransmissions. The selection of MPR in OLSR protocol for data exchange is prone to node isolation attack. We propose a system suitable for securing the OLSR protocol from node isolation attack. The proposed system considers two aspects of node isolation attack - monitor and detection. Monitoring deals with applying appropriate contradiction rules and fictitious setting mechanism to reduce the performance of an attacker to act as an MPR. Detection deals with a method for detecting the attack that occurs bypassing the monitoring mechanism and it aids to know the chances for the attacker to act as an MPR through the beacon signal mechanism. The performance evaluation shows that the system monitors more than 95% of the attack.

223,223,An Emergency Theory of Terminal Relay for WCN with 4G LTE,"Four-generation (4G) mobile system standards defined in Advanced Long Term Advanced (LTE-A), which provide a communication speed of 100 megabytes per second for mobile communications and 1 gigabit per second for trivial. In LTE-A the distribution of inter-node wireless communication tools known as relays is standardized for the first time. In optimal circumstances, relay distribution should improve network coverage and enable reliable communications at the cellular level. Despite the benefits of the system-based LTE-A system, industry experts have shown that a high deviation from the corresponding conditions can lead to significant losses in terms of real interest rates and hedging. We recognize the relays as one of the most efficient standard components of LTE-A. However, the standard has major drawbacks due to the assumption that the static relay nodes are known on their position and size. Although these hypotheses facilitate the design of cellular systems, they limit a range of use of the relay. Alternatively, consider a cellular system in which a wireless terminal (WTS) and its transmission signals act as relays to help other WTs. In such systems, the number of scales with the number of WTS system developers offers much higher degrees of freedom.

It handles the data of clusters of buildings at the user-end. Each cluster of buildings has the multiple number of apartments. Six fogs are considered for six different regions. Six number of clusters are considered in this scenario. Each cluster has one fog. MicroGrids (MG) are available near the buildings and accessible by fog. Multiple algorithms are used for load balancing to manage the load. The proposed algorithm in this scenario is Min-Min algorithm. The Min-Min algorithm is a simple algorithm that manages the resources efficiently. In this algorithm the completion time of a task is calculated and initially, resources are allocated to those tasks which have minimum execution time. Results are compared with Round Robin (RR) algorithm which is also used for load balancing. Simulation results shows that by applying the proposed algorithm the cost is reduced as compare to RR.",60089631,COMSATS University Islamabad,Islamabad,Pakistan,"['1706', '1705', '1710']",11.238095238095237,0.13538961038961042,0.3613636363636364,1
249,249,Industrial Metal Waste Management with MAGNETO Robot,"The world depends and strives on robots for solving the monotonous labour which does not require human intelligence; sometimes working in hazardous environments. This paper presents a robot designed to perform a common industrial task i.e. the disposal of iron fillings and chips near a machine which ejects these iron wastes that emanate due to a cutting or a lathing operation. The proposed semi-autonomous robot “Magneto” provides a cost effective solution for this industrial problem. This robot can pick and place the iron pieces using an electromagnet assembly housed on it, besides, the capability of following a predefined route. The magnetization of the electromagnet is time controlled precisely; i.e. during its travel to reach the work place the electromagnet is inhibited from energising in order to save power. Further, when the robot is near the work area, the position of the electromagnet is lowered through a motorised control. This gives the flexibility, ease of movement and lower power requirement for the robot. Different sensors are deployed on the robot for the overall assistance of the robot for its manoeuvre and iron acquisition. The robot as well as the electromagnet is designed, developed and real-time tested and the results are presented under various operating conditions.",60076781,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,Coimbatore,India,"['1706', '1705', '1710']",18.545454545454547,0.0421875,0.44843749999999993,1

The sensors are connected to NodeMCU which sends moisture level data to Raspberry Pi in a wireless manner using MQTT protocol. When the soil of the farm gets dry, moisture sensors sense the same and Raspberry Pi automatically sends the signal to turn the motor ON. We have kept a threshold for the water level and as soon as it is reached, Raspberry Pi and NodeMCU take the control and maintain water level accordingly. How the IoT devices like Raspberry Pi and NodeMCU are used to govern the process of water supply in the rural areas is described through our work. The experimental results of CESIS show how the all-important resource water is saved by automatic governance of water irrigation. We also propose a CESIS variant that is more cost effective.",60115237,Uka Tarsadia University,Tarsadi,India,"['1706', '1705', '1710']",20.25,0.2822619047619047,0.5242857142857142,1

The increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications cause large data traffic on the cloud system which increase the response time and cost. To overcome this situation, fog computing concept is introduced in this paper. It also reduce the load of cloud and the latency rate of response time to the energy consumption side. Fogs have less storage capacity as compare to cloud, however have all the services available as in cloud side. The Smart Grid (SG) is a modern electric grid like smart meters and smart appliances which efficiently manage the resources allocation. In this work, consider a large geographical residential area divided into six regions and each region has a fog server to manage the energy requests coming from the end users. Each fog has a number of Virtual Machines (VMs) to efficiently manage the different user requests in minimum time and cost. The Micro Grids (MG’s) are the small scale power grid which manage the energy consumption by reducing the time and cost of end users and are connected to the fog edges.

Apart from the many advantages, LTE–OFDM system suffers from high peak to mean power ratio (PMPR) is a major issue due to the large envelope fluctuations in the signal. It forces the power amplifier (PA) to operate in the nonlinear region which causes undesired distortions like in-band distortion and out-of band (OOB) radiation. These undesired distortions degrade the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system, causes interference to other users and thus decreases the cellular capacity of the system. To improve the efficiency of LTE–OFDM system, this paper mainly focuses on implementation of two clipping based PMPR reduction techniques (RCF & RFC) and their performance evaluated in terms of complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of PMPR and BER.

The sensor nodes have responsibility to sense an event and send information towards an actor node. The actor node is responsible to take prompt decision and react accordingly. In order to provide effective sensing and acting, a distributed local coordination mechanism is necessary among sensors and actors. In this work, we consider the actor node selection problem and propose a fuzzy-based system that based on data provided by sensors and actors selects an appropriate actor node.

292,292,An Adaptive Profile-Based Approach for Detecting Anomalous Traffic in Backbone,"Anomaly detection is the first step with a challenging task of securing a communication network, as the anomalies may indicate suspicious behaviors, attacks, network malfunctions, or failures. In this paper, we address the problem of not only detecting different anomalies, such as volume based (e.g., DDoS or Flash crowd) and spatial based (e.g., network scan), that arise simultaneously in the wild but also of attributing the anomalous point to a single-anomaly event causing it. Besides, we also tackle the problem of low-detection accuracy caused by the phenomenon of traffic drift. To this end, a novel adaptive profile-based anomaly detection scheme is proposed. More specifically, a more comprehensive metrics set is defined from the dimensions of temporal, spatial, category, and intensity to compose IP traffic behavior characteristic spectrum for fine-grained traffic characterization. Then, the digital signature matrix obtained by using the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is applied to construct the baseline profile of the normal traffic behavior. Anomalous points are identified and analyzed by using confidence bands and a generic clustering technique, respectively. Finally, a lightweight updating strategy is applied to reduce the number of false positives.

296,296,An end-to-end differential network learning method for semantic segmentation,"Deep convolution neural network has become the primary framework for semantic image segmentation in recent years, and most existing methods using deep learning have achieved a great improvement on the performance compared with traditional methods. Although most methods using fully convolutional networks are concerned about the segmentation of small objects or small/fine parts of objects, the small object segmentation is still a challenging problem. To the best of our knowledge, the main reason is that several pooling or convolution operations with two or more stride size cause the features of small objects to vanish in later layers, even if taking different kinds of multi-scale measures. In the paper, we design a novel differential network which addresses the small object segmentation. Specifically, our networks include two pipelines: the first pipeline is served as the primary segmentation network using existing methods, and the second one is a refine network that we propose. The score maps of two networks are merged by calculating the sum of corresponding channels in their last layers. We first learn the primary segmentation network to get a coarse segmentation model, and then train the two networks jointly in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments show that our method can deal with small objects effectively.

When the channel is sparse, the estimation process can be modeled as a sparse recovery problem using compressed sensing (CS) theory.

Research has not conclusively verified whether or not transportation dependence on EVs achieves the suggested sustainability goals at the rate required by climate policy and science. In this study, we conduct a life cycle assessment to measure the impact of different regional energy mixes and climates temperatures, for both the electric and conventional vehicles. Specifically, we modeled the case of Los Angeles, California vs. Detroit, Michigan for current energy mixes for both cities in 2017, as well as the projected ones for 2020 and 2030 plans. Also, we compared the difference in GHG emissions produced in the two cities to value the impact of the variations in both the weather and generation portfolios. We used GREET, a full life cycle assessment model released by the Argonne National Laboratory of the Department of Energy. The results show that the geographical differences greatly influence the level of GHG emitted from the utilization of the EVs. Specifically, for the same level of driving (considering the same car model), the EVs in Los Angeles have lower GHG emissions than in Detroit. Furthermore, Detroit's lower ambient temperature for most of the year will result in higher levels in both GHG emission intensities and battery-charging inefficiencies. Additionally, the modeled energy grid mix for Michigan in all case scenarios (2017, 2020 and 2030) contains high percentage of coal as a fuel, compared to no coal at all in California's energy grid, making the EVs charging process in Detroit lead to more GHG emissions than in Los Angeles.",60015206,Florida International University,Miami,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",23.90909090909091,0.18593406593406595,0.4670879120879121,1

303,303,PRESS/HOLD/RELEASE Ultrasonic Gestures and Low Complexity Recognition Based on TCN,"Targeting ultrasound-based gesture recognition, this paper proposes a new universal PRESS/HOLD/RELEASE approach that leverages the diversity of gestures performed on smart devices such as mobile phones and IoT nodes. The new set of gestures are generated by interleaving PRESS/HOLD/RELEASE patterns; abbreviated as P/H/R, with gestures like sweeps between a number of microphones. P/H/R patterns are constructed by a hand as it approaches a top of a microphone to generate a virtual Press. After that, the hand settles for an undefined period of time to generate a virtual Hold and finally departs to generate a virtual Release. The same hand can sweep to a 2nd microphone and perform another P/H/R. Interleaving the P/H/R patterns expands the number of performed gestures. Assuming an on-board speaker transmitting ultrasonic signals, the detection is performed on Doppler shift readings generated by a hand as it approaches and departs a top of a microphone. The Doppler shift readings are presented in a sequence of down-mixed ultrasonic spectrogram frames. We train a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to classify the P/H/R patterns under different environmental noises. Our experimental results show that such P/H/R patterns at a top of a microphone can be achieved with 96.6% accuracy under different noise conditions. A group of P/H/R based gestures has been tested on commercially off-The-shelf (COTS) Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Different P/H/R interleaved gestures (such as sweeps, long taps, etc.) are designed using two microphones and a single speaker while using as low as \sim 5\mathrm{K} parameters and as low as \sim 0.15 Million operations (MOPs) in compute power per inference. The P/H/R interleaved set of gestures are intuitive and hence are easy to learn by end users. This paves its way to be deployed by smartphones and smart speakers for mass production.",60032882,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Eindhoven,Netherlands,"['1711', '1708']",20.857142857142858,0.10888347763347765,0.44030934343434347,1

Feature representation ability directly affects the accuracy of sound classification. Therefore, the ESC performance is heavily dependent on the effectiveness of representative features extracted from the environmental sounds.

In addition, we adopt the proposed Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) and score level fusion to jointly improve the classification accuracy. Extensive truncation schemes are evaluated to find the optimal number and the corresponding band ranges of sub-spectrograms.

Nevertheless, there are still some cases of in-hospital death for elective admissions. In this work we have developed all-health condition, machine learning-based models to predict death for the case of elective admissions, applicable at the time of scheduling the admission, drawing upon a large cross-provider, state-wide dataset of discharge records. The best performing of the developed models demonstrated an AUC of 0.924, showing high discriminative performance. Based on a review of the literature there appears to be no equivalent previously published all-condition predictive model to predict in-hospital mortality of elective admission patients.

Many consumers are especially concerned about the security and privacy of IoT devices. The purpose of this paper is to test an Amazon Echo's vulnerability against a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. Using a test wireless network, and assuming that a cyber-criminal already has access to your home network, we monitored the network traffic of the Amazon Echo while it is under a DoS attack. We then used one instance of Kali Linux to perform the attacks on the device, while another instance of Kali was used to monitor the network during the attack. The attackable to cause the device to crash and disconnect from the network. We were also able to analyze the network traffic using Wireshark and show where the network packets were dropping during the attack. We found that initiating a Denial-of-Service attack on an Amazon Echo device could be a fairly easy task. In this paper, we pointed out that if an attacker has the knowledge and ability to gain access to a home network, it can be quite easy to obtain information about the connected devices, using free and relatively simple penetration tools within Kali Linux.

The ever-increasing threat of hardware Trojan attacks against integrated circuits has spurred a need for accurate and efficient detection methods. Ring oscillator network (RON) is used to detect the Trojan by capturing the difference in power consumption; the power consumption of a Trojan-free circuit is different from the Trojan-inserted circuit. However, the process variation and measurement noise are the major obstacles to detect hardware Trojan with high accuracy. In this paper, we quantitatively compare four supervised machine learning algorithms and classifier optimization strategies for maximizing accuracy and minimizing the false positive rate (FPR).

Cloud computing offers scalable and economical computational resources to researchers. However, this new paradigm comes at a cost of new security vulnerabilities. While there are methods for ensuring computational attestation for various computations, these methods can be limited, as they may require extensive computation costs, a prior knowledge of boundary conditions or a solution to the computation, or may be limited to deterministic calculations, yet at the very heart of modern physics research lies the requirement for non-deterministic models. Pseudo-random number generators (PRNG) are used for many such experiments to simulate the randomness. It is vital for the PRNGs to have a high degree of entropy. A cloud is an excellent choice for running large scale simulations. However, existing research posit that that PRNGs within virtual machines running in a cloud may possess a lower entropy than that of a local machine. In this paper, we examine this problem.

Current methods of autonomous vehicle verification such as shadow driving or annotated images based testing are costly, slow and resource intensive. Hence, modeling and simulation is an indispensable asset to achieve verification goals for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose an abstract simulation scenario generation framework for autonomous vehicle verification. The scenes and the related assertions are defined by a matrixbased semantic language and translated into test scenarios in simulation.

317,317,A Testbed for the Evaluation of Denial of Service Attacks in Software-Defined Networks,"Software defined networking (SDN) is being widely deployed within enterprise and carrier networks to streamline network services provisioning and reduce costs. This approach improves upon traditional networking protocol technologies by decoupling the data and control planes and moving all control provisioning decisions to a centralized SDN controller. Overall, centralized control delivers much more cost-effective and flexible networking setups that can support a wide range of customized user-driven network management applications, e.g., traffic engineering, security, survivability, policy control, etc. However, the separation of the data and control layers in a SDN network introduces many attack points for malicious users to exploit. In particular, large-scale denial of service (DoS) attacks are a major concern here, as they can effectively shut down vital communications between the SDN controller and data plane nodes. Given the increasing sophistication of such attacks, SDN DoS detection and mitigation have become vital concerns. Although various studies have addressed this problem area, there is a further need to develop and test solutions in live realistic network settings. Along these lines, this paper overviews this important area and demonstrates the impact of DoS attacks on SDN elements in the NSF GENI network testbed.

318,318,Informal IT and Routine Activity Theory -A Theoretical Review,"This study seeks to explore the risks of insider threat due to frequent informal technology (IT) usage in organizations. The use of informal IT tools and resources at the workplace becomes a routine phenomenon which has diminished the boundaries between work and personal life domains. Also, it has increased the complexity of employees' IT usage and created indistinctness in work ethics. It is a fact that the biggest threat organizations face today is the threat posed by their own employees. I propose that utilizing routine activity theory (RAT) from criminology to information system literature perspective is critical to understand the likelihood of insider threat as a consequence of informal IT usage. RAT assumes that a crime can arise from changes in the situation or environmental settings. Prior research reveals several positive outcomes of informal IT such as; employees' productivity, job satisfaction, efficiency, collaboration, knowledge sharing, and lowering of operational costs for organizations. Bdes positive outcomes, prior research has also indicated the likelihood of security risks through informal IT usage. Guided by RAT, this research seeks to present a conceptual framework that explains that informal IT usage may jeopardize information security and may consider the activity as an insider threat.

319,319,Efficiently Learning a Robust Self-Driving Model with Neuron Coverage Aware Adaptive Filter Reuse,"Human drivers learn driving skills from both regular (non-Accidental) and accidental driving experiences, while most of current self-driving research focuses on regular driving only. We argue that learning from accidental driving data is necessary for robustly modeling driving behavior. A main challenge, however, is how accident data can be effectively used together with regular data to learn vehicle motion, since manually labeling accident data without expertise is significantly difficult. Our proposed solution for robust vehicle motion learning, in this paper, is to integrate layer-level discriminability and neuron coverage(neuron-level robustness) regulariziers into an unsupervised generative network for video prediction. Layer-level discriminability increases divergence of feature distribution between the regular data and accident data at network layers. Neuron coverage regulariziers enlarge interval span of neuron activation adopted by training samples, to reduce probability that a sample falls into untested interval regions. To accelerate training process, we propose adaptive filter reuse based on neuron coverage. Our strategies of filter reuse reduce structural network parameters, encourage memory reuse, and guarantee effectiveness of robust vehicle motion learning. Experiments results show that our model improves the inference accuracy by 1.1% compared to FCMLSTM, and cut down 10.2% training time over the traditional method with negligible accuracy loss.",60008724,Duke University,Durham,United States,"['1711', '1708']",22.333333333333332,0.04365079365079365,0.46285103785103787,1

A relay node may be a simple repeater or a fully functional entity depending upon the deployment scenario. In a two-way relay communication (TWRC), Physical-Layer network coding (PNC) exploits the superimposed nature of electromagnetic waves at the relay node to improve the throughput performance. Synchronization of information from two end users is critical when exchanging information via a relay node. Traditionally in PNC, modulation constellations sent from the two end users are chosen to be the same. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a PNC-based TWRC system in a Rayleigh fading scenario when the modulation constellation of one end user is rotated with respect to the modulation constellation at the other end user. The analysis shows that the rotated-QPSK gives distinct decision regions when the modulation constellation of QPSK and rotated-QPSK are superimposed, unlike the traditional (QPSK)(QPSK) transmission. Simulation results for the symbol error rate (SER) at the relay node shows the loss in performance of (QPSK)-(rotated-QPSK) scheme compared to the (QPSK)(QPSK) scheme due to phase rotation.",60020583,The University of Alabama in Huntsville,Huntsville,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",23.625,0.005555555555555554,0.43134920634920637,1
321,321,Finite Element Based Optimal Commutation under Multiple Objective Functions for Magnetically Uncoupled Linear Variable Reluctance Motors with Different Airgap Geometries,"Optimal commutation of magnetically uncoupled linear variable reluctance motors depends on their geometry and phase current limits. When subjected to the same phase current limits, tooth geometry differences in these motors lead to significant differences in their maximum force output. This is true for various objectives to maximize force or minimize copper losses with or without constraints on the amount of force ripple. This study uses a finite element data based nonlinear model of a group of linear variable reluctance motors with magnetically uncoupled ux paths to determine the optimal commutation for each motor design that would achieve a specified objective function. Varying tooth widths at constant tooth pitch distinguish the motors in the study. Force ripple is measured by the 2-norm of the force ripple waveform. The results presented provide a basis for identifying which motor tooth geometries are more favorable given an intended application, be that an application where force ripple is tolerated, constant force (minimum ripple) is necessary or copper loss minimization is most important. A subset of tooth geometry shapes is identified as generally favorable, and a new expression for tooth shape factor is introduced to help in analysis and design studies by constraining choices from the range of feasible tooth geometries to this favorable subset.",60002804,University of Tennessee at Chattanooga,Chattanooga,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",26.25,0.15409090909090908,0.5114141414141414,1

The scarcity of communication bandwidth has lead researchers to investigate algorithms to identify busy channels over the airwave so they can be avoided and not add to communication degradation. This is very salient in the over used ISM band. In the ISM band the solution lies in developing efficient algorithms to detect which parts of the band are being used and utilize an agile communication system to hop to the available parts which support good communication.

That is why it is problematic to define the efficiency of expert estimation methods. We propose to define efficiency of such methods based on stability of their results under perturbations of input data. We compare two modifications of combinatorial method of expert data aggregation (spanning tree enumeration). Using the example of these two methods, we illustrate two approaches to efficiency evaluation. The first approach is based on usage of real data, obtained through estimation of a set of model objects by a group of experts. The second approach is based on simulation of the whole expert examination cycle (including expert estimates). During evaluation of efficiency of the two listed modifications of combinatorial expert data aggregation method the simulation-based approach proved more robust and credible. Our experimental study confirms that if weights of spanning trees are taken into consideration, the results of combinatorial data aggregation method become more stable. So, weighted spanning tree enumeration method has an advantage over non-weighted method (and, consequently, over logarithmic least squares and row geometric mean methods).",60011313,National Academy of Sciences in Ukraine,Kiev,Ukraine,['1700'],20.6,0.15673076923076923,0.4400641025641026,0

329,329,Performance Evaluation of Dynamic Round Robin Algorithms for CPU Scheduling,"The performance of an operating system (OS) is affected by the algorithm policy that is used by a CPU to schedule the running processes. Thus, a better CPU scheduling algorithm results in faster OS performance using minimal resources over small amounts of time [11]. For that reason, many algorithms were proposed and implemented to enhance the performance of CPU scheduling. Round Robin is considered an efficient and fair algorithm because all processes are given the same amount of time quantum. However, its efficiency depends on the selected time quantum. In this paper, we present a comparative study of four different Round Robin algorithms namely: Adaptive Round Robin Algorithm, Best Time Quantum Round Robin CPU Scheduling, Optimal Round Robin Scheduling Using Manhattan Distance Algorithm, and Improved Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm. We compare these algorithms in terms of four performance factors including: Average Waiting Time (AWT), Average Turnaround Time (ATT), Average Response Time (ART) and Number of Contexts Switching (NCS). The simulation results show that both Adaptive Round Robin and Optimal Round Robin Scheduling Using Manhattan Distance algorithms are more efficient to be adopted as they recorded the minimum values of performance factors.",60007488,Tennessee State University,Nashville,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",23.875,0.038095238095238106,0.42023809523809535,1

The increase in online access and control given by the incorporation of CPSs introduces a new challenge securing the operations of the CPS in that they are not supported by standard security protocols. This paper describes a process used to effectively protect the operations of an IIoT system by implementing security protocols on the CPS within the IIoT. A series of predefined boundary conditions of the safety critical parameters for which a heating and cooling CPS can safely operate within were established. If the CPS is commended to operate outside of these boundaries, it will disconnect from all external communication network and default to some pre-defined safe-operation mode until the system has been evaluated locally by an administrator and released from the safe-mode. This method was tested and validated by establishing a sample IIoT and CPS testbed setup which monitor and control the temperature of a target environment. An attack was initiated to force the target environment outside of the determined safety-critical parameters. The system responded by disabling all network ports and defaulted to the safe-operation mode established previously.",60007488,Tennessee State University,Nashville,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",25.5,0.157979797979798,0.3059379509379509,1
331,331,Alien Escapade - The Game,"Gaming has become an integral part of our day-today life. The video game industry has grown over the years, and now more and more people are playing video games. Moreover, video games have become a major source of entertainment, and with the help of smart phones, the gaming industry has taken over other platforms. Today, there is competition between the video game platforms themselves and about 47% Americans play video games on mobile devices, leaving other dedicated gaming consoles behind, which make the mobile devices as the most popular platform for gaming. This paper presents a mobile game called 'Alien Escapade' which can be played on an Android or IOS device. It is an endless runner type game where the character keeps on running infinitely while jumping over or dodging obstacles, as long as the user does not make a mistake and crashes into one of the obstacles. Alien Escapade is a game which starts with a non-threatening alien with big eyes, small nose, big ears, a smile similar to a human baby, and a short body who gets lost and arrives on our planet Earth in the hope of finding a way back to his planet. However, its hope has been ruined by the human scientists who want to study the alien and learn more about it by capturing it. As the alien realizes this, he escapes. The players have to help the alien escape from the clutches of the scientists by helping the alien dodge, jump over, and slide under different obstacles and collect energy points. We validated the game through a survey by randomly selecting a small cohort of students to play this game for a few minutes and then fill-out a questionnaire and the initial results are encouraging.",60027501,Alabama State University,Montgomery,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",26.545454545454547,-0.08251661129568107,0.4161129568106312,1
332,332,PurgeMEM: Towards Building A Memory Safe Cloud,"Cloud computing has become the industry standard for rapid application deployment, scalable server support, and mobile and distributed services. It provides seamless scalability and access to infinite resource theoretically. Unfortunately, the co-tenancy of cloud computing makes Cloud Services vulnerable to privacy issues. In the past, researchers have shown that it is possible to compromise important information by exploiting the co-tenancy nature of clouds. In this paper, we first identify a new method which can be used to collect residual application data from the main memory of a virtual machine hosted in the cloud even the application is closed by the user. We show that using traditional forensic tools in all three major cloud providers (Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure), one can gather information about a closed application from the main memory if the machine is compromised. To resolve this vulnerability, we propose PurgeMEM, a framework which provides a service for deleting residual memory left by a closed application. PurgeMEM continuously monitors processes launched by user applications. When a process is about to finish, PurgeMEM is notified and then it cleans up the physical memory location by writing known hex values and thereby preserving the privacy of the user data. We developed a PurgeMEM prototype for the Linux environment and evaluated it with four small applications. For all the applications, our prototype is able to sanitize and delete memory residuals successfully with a negligible performance overhead (2.97%).",60027086,The University of Alabama at Birmingham,Birmingham,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",21.636363636363637,0.0378271349862259,0.42147284533648166,1

In this algorithm, agents can effectively conduct negotiations in a so-called incomplete information setting where only limited information about other parties is available for negotiating agents. We face the problem by breaking it into three distinct phases. The first stage is to schedule each agent individually and provide it with the lowest cost path using the Dijkstra algorithm. The next stage involves finding the best possible bids for each agent. The final stage is to reschedule each agent individually to satisfy the total demand, which is positioning all agents on their desired destinations where collisions are avoided and traveling time is optimally minimized. This cooperative pathfinding allows agents to know each other's intentions and communicate their planned paths. In the proposed dynamic system, to account for unknown and unpredictable moving obstacles, if a collision is imminent, each agent needs to decide how to proceed by researching and selecting a new path and modifying its current plan in a timely manner.",60010339,Florida Institute of Technology,Melbourne,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",22.5,0.09310310901219991,0.47109405745769384,1

342,342,Flexible and Simplified Multi-bit Successive-Cancellation List Decoding for Polar Codes,"Polar codes, as the first channel code that can provably achieve the channel capacity, have received increasing attention these years. However, in practical application, the decoding of polar codes still has many aspects that need improvement. One of the key bottlenecks of polar codes decoding is the high latency of SC (Successive Cancellation)-based decoding algorithms. As one of the solutions to this problem, many SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding algorithms with the multi-bit decision are proposed. Despite of the reduction of decoding latency, the complexity spent for computation and sort of path candidates of these algorithms has significantly increased in contrast with the conventional SCL algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel SCL decoding algorithm with multi-bit decision for polar codes, named as Flexible and Simplified Multi-bit Successive Cancellation List (FSMSCL) decoding. The proposed algorithm further reduces the latency compared to other existing multi-bit decoding algorithms. On the other hand, we provide different path-splitting schemes for different code blocks to control the complexity of computation and sort of path metrics. In the analysis, the experiment results show that the proposed algorithm has similar FER performance compared to the conventional SCL algorithm but its decoding latency outperforms other peer decoding algorithms with multi-bit decision.",60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,"['1711', '1708']",22.666666666666668,0.03454761904761906,0.4393809523809523,1

In their simplest form, social networks consist of nodes corresponding to people and links between pairs of nodes corresponding to relationships between those people. Social networks can be constructed by examining actual groups of people and identifying the relationships of interest between them. However, there are circumstances where such empirical social networks are unavailable, or their use would be undesirable. Consequently, methods to generate synthetic social networks that are not identical to real-world networks but have desired structural similarities to them are valuable. A process for generating synthetic social networks based on attributing human personality types to the nodes and then stochastically adding links between nodes based on the compatibility of the nodes' personalities was developed. A Monte Carlo search algorithm finding an effective assignment of personality types to nodes was implemented and tested. This algorithm was evaluated in terms of realism, i.e., the similarity of the generated synthetic social to exemplar real-world social networks, for 14 different real-world social networks using 18 standard quantitative network metrics. Findings were that this approach produces realistic networks.",60020583,The University of Alabama in Huntsville,Huntsville,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",21.22222222222222,0.06500000000000002,0.17500000000000007,1
356,356,Requirements for the Next-Generation Autonomous Vehicle Ecosystem,"Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is a huge leap forward in capability for mobility. To be effective, the current human based vehicle safety infrastructure will have to be upgraded. A critical leg of this infrastructure is the automobile accident report. Conventional vehicle accident reports have evolved to a point where law enforcement have a reasonably standard approach focused on humans. However, with AVs there are no drivers to interview. Also, given their automation, a flaw found in an AV has the potential to be a systemic risk. In this respect, AVs must be handled more like airplanes in terms of post accident procedures. In this paper, we explore the requirements for AV accident reports and the escalation procedures required to avoid systemic risks.

To achieve the accuracy and consistency in recognizing handwritten characters, the present work discusses an efficient approach to segment the handwritten text into individual characters. In order to achieve this, the writing space is divided into three different zones and then the zones are subdivided tiny square shape grids, which are distributed evenly. After this, we analyze to find the presence of handwritten character in a selected grid by performing horizontal scanning method. Moreover, we propose an approach of segmenting the character set of a single line text by vertical scanning and curve pattern analysis on the touching zones of the selective grids.

Accuracy goals can be achieved in two ways i.e. using mechanical and or programming techniques.

We built an autonomous robot by considering the above target goals of precision and accuracy and used it in the 2017 IEEE hardware competitions for performing the desired tasks. The sensors being used for reading the input data are optical shaft encoders that work by converting angular position of the motor into a digital output value. By feeding these values from the encoder input through the estimated PID control formula, the precision is greatly increased. In addition, the accuracy will also be maximized with Gyro sensor.

372,372,Improving Reliability of ReRAM-Based DNN Implementation through Novel Weight Distribution,"Binary deep neural networks, that have been implemented in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) for storage efficiency, suffer from poor recognition performance in the presence of hardware errors. This paper addresses this problem by deriving a novel weight distribution and representation scheme that mitigates errors due to faulty ReRAM cells with minimal storage overhead. In the proposed scheme, the weight matrix is partitioned into grains, and each weight in a grain is represented by the sum of a multi-bit mean and a 1-bit deviation. The grain size as well as the mean to deviation ratio of the weights in a grain can be chosen such that the network is resilient to hardware errors. A hybrid processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture is proposed to support this scheme. The mean values are stored in a small SRAM and processed by a CMOS unit, and the deviations are stored and processed by the ReRAM unit. Compared to the baseline binary neural network which fails in the presence of severe hardware errors, the proposed hybrid scheme has only a mild recognition performance degradation. Simulation results show the proposed scheme achieves 97.84% test accuracy (a 0.84% accuracy drop) on a MNIST dataset, and 88.07% test accuracy (a 1.10% accuracy drop) on a CIFAR-10 dataset under 9.04% stuck-At-1 and 1.75% stuck-At-0 faults.",60003892,Arizona State University,Tempe,United States,"['1711', '1708']",26.75,-0.1907051282051282,0.5567307692307693,1
373,373,Experiments for Reinforced Concrete Foundation Remote Monitoring,"The design and testing of a solution to provide energy for, and communications with, sensors encased in reinforced concrete structures, without additional wiring, was investigated. The single wire transmission line technique was adapted for use on reinforcing steel (rebar) embedded in the concrete. Experiments were conducted that first validated the approach on rebar in an ambient air medium. After the validation tests were completed, testing in concrete was conducted. To interface with the rebar special directional couplers were designed that focus the energy along the rebar in one direction. To ensure the results would be transferrable to industry, the couplers were kept physically small by using a carrier frequency of 2.4 GHz. The couplers were constructed using advanced manufacturing techniques, including laser-cut copper components and computer-aided manufacturing for the plastic dielectric members. The baseline testing in air verified that the rebar functioned as a single wire transmission line and that the coupler design worked. However, when the experimentation moved to encasement of the rebar and couplers in concrete, the performance degraded significantly. The degradation in concrete was large enough to suggest that the use of 2.4 GHz may not support either communications or energy harvesting in reinforced concrete structures. A second design approach was pursued that investigated using a much lower carrier frequency of 8 kHz. Though the degradation was not as severe as with 2.4 GHz, it was still substantial enough to indicate that the rebar single wire transmission line approach faces challenges that may warrant consideration of other techniques for embedded monitoring of reinforced concrete structures.

TSA methods are crucial to alert operators or controls not only that a fault has occurred, but also that the power system has lost or will lose stability and therefore action must be taken. The two conditions that are important in real time application for a power system are accuracy and response time. Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines have been implemented in the past and have achieved satisfying classification accuracy. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system is proposed for TSA to maximize accuracy while minimizing response time to distinguish from older methods of machine learning.

Additionally, each fund has multiple category variables that determine diversity when combined into a portfolio. The base fitness score for each portfolio is the sum of its funds' individual fitness scores. Portfolio fitness scores adjust based on the included funds' category variable diversity. Portfolios that consist of funds with largely similar categories receive lower adjusted fitness scores and do not cross over. This process encourages strong and diversified portfolios to reproduce.

PCM derives temporal parameters and code size parameter of each task, and thus determines the system end-to-end timing requirements with reduced code size. The proposed methodology makes a set of design parameters to optimize the real-time embedded system output. Our design framework uses Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling technique to improve system utilization by reducing dead cycles. The level of optimization is evaluated using ARM7 development suite. Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) method is applied to optimize power consumption by adjusting the frequency.

379,379,Exploration of On-device End-To-End Acoustic Modeling with Neural Networks,"Real-Time speech recognition on mobile and embedded devices is an important application of neural networks. Acoustic modeling is the fundamental part of speech recognition and is usually implemented with long short-Term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the single thread execution of an LSTM RNN is extremely slow in most embedded devices because the algorithm needs to fetch a large number of parameters from the DRAM for computing each output sample. We explore a few acoustic modeling algorithms that can be executed very efficiently on embedded devices. These algorithms reduce the overhead of memory accesses using multi-Timestep parallelization that computes multiple output samples at a time by reading the parameters only once from the DRAM. The algorithms considered are the quasi RNNs (QRNNs), Gated ConvNets, and diagonalized LSTMs. In addition, we explore neural networks that equip one-dimensional (1-D) convolution at each layer of these algorithms, and by which can obtain a very large performance increase in QRNNs and Gated ConvNets.

380,380,Verifying mobile systems: Take two stateful observations of Pi-calculus processes," All rights reserved.This papers relates the design and development of two ""proof of concept"" analysis tools for the pi-calculus. The main functionality of the first tool, named PiEx-plorer, is to construct the state-space of a finitary pi-calculus process as a directed graph akin to a finite-state automaton. As counterintuitive as it may seem, this is a rather complex objective. The second tool is an implementation of the main pi-calculus features (especially name-passing) in the Promela language. This enables the use of the Spin model checker for the verification task. Although very different, these two prototypes share a common foundation: a notion of a stateful observer for pi-calculus processes.

381,381,"Design,Development and Experimental setup of a PMU network for monitoring and anomaly detection","Introduction of Synchronized phasor measurement unit (PMU) in power system is a solution for monitoring system wide disturbances. PMUs provide precise information about a system's phasors such as magnitude and phase angle of sine waves of the system. PMU data is a valuable source when determining the post-mortem of a fault, or a system disturbance. It can be unveiled what time the system began to falter and exactly what instabilities the system experienced. Knowing the cause of such instabilities will allow enhancement of the current system protection system. This will help in minimizing risk, disruptions or total system collapse. PMUs are synchronized via global positioning system (GPS). For wide area monitoring (WAM), synchronization of the PMUs allows for interconnected systems to be monitored simultaneously, giving real time records. This paper explores the impact of PMU in modern power system, deployment strategies of PMU network around Texas Tech University, importance of PMU data collected from the network, correlation of events by data analysis and focus on how the time stamped information is valuable for grid stability.

382,382,TRA-GT based approach for the allocation optimization of defensive resources to protect pipelines from the attacks of the third party,"It is difficult for traditional risk decision-making methods to simulate the strategic interaction between the pipeline company and the third party, which restricts the effective allocation of pipeline defensive resources. In view of this, the game theory (GT) combined with traditional risk assessment (TRA) method is used to analyze the interaction process. Considering different attack targets, attack strategies, and differences in revenue calculations of different third party types, the game model is extended into a Bayesian-Stackelberg model under the assumption of complete rationality and common knowledge. The proposed method is verified on an oil pipeline. The return on investment can be 15.14 and shows that this approach can give advice to the optimization of defense resource allocation to achieving the purpose of reducing operation and maintenance costs by comparing the expected losses of different defense strategies by assignment calculations.",60021623,Sinopec,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",27.8,-0.07142857142857144,0.5142857142857143,1

The purpose of SIEM and the main tasks that it should solve are reviewed. The peculiarities of solving the problem of choosing of SIEM are analyzed. The groups of indicators that characterize the degree of fulfillment of the requirements to SIEM are highlighted. The application of fuzzy set theory for processing expert information on qualitative indicators characterizing SIEM is proposed. The formulation of the SIEM selection problem is done and the main stages of its solution are proposed: preparation of initial data; choosing the method of solving the multicriteria problem; algorithm development. The method of normalization of SIEM quantitative indicators and the method of paired comparison based on the rank estimates for processing of SIEM qualitative indicators are proposed. It is proposed to use the 9-point Saaty scale to derive functions of SIEM qualitative values based on the processing of expert assessments. The algorithm of the considered method is implemented. Methods for solving multicriteria problems are analyzed and the use of a lexographic method is proposed for solving the SIEM solution for the Security Center (SOC).

It has a matrix class in its standard library, but its execution tends to be rather slow. Only a couple of actual scientific computing libraries like NumPy for Python exist for Ruby. In this paper we introduce a new library called Bohrium.rb. Bohrium.rb acts as a front end for the Bohrium framework, which generates and runs JIT-compiled OpenMP/OpenCL kernels. It currently supports Python/NumPy and C++, however as it is built of processes communicating hierarchically to each other, we can replace the front ends with new ones. This new Ruby front end is described with examples and is then compared to the standard library and an already established Ruby library Numo/Narray, where Bohrium.rb seems to be faster for still larger matrix calculations. This is also the trend we have seen in similar areas with Bohrium, being faster once its overhead has been amortized.",60017041,Niels Bohr Institute,Copenhagen,Denmark,['1700'],21.375,0.005606060606060592,0.3925757575757576,0

392,392,"Towards an Analysis of the Architecture, Security, and Privacy Issues in Vehicular Fog Computing","The vehicular fog is a relatively new computing paradigm where fog computing works with the vehicular network. It provides computation, storage, and location-aware services with low latency to the vehicles in close proximity. A vehicular fog network can be formed on-the-fly by adding underutilized or unused resources of nearby parked or moving vehicles. Interested vehicles can outsource their resources or data by being added to the vehicular fog network while maintaining proper security and privacy. Client vehicles can use these resources or services for performing computation-intensive tasks, storing data, or getting crowd-source reports through the proper secure and privacy-preserving communication channel. As most vehicular network applications are latency and location sensitive, fog is more suitable than the cloud because of the capability of performing calculations with low latency, location awareness, and the support of mobility.

This work investigates atomic operations as a technique to improve communication efficiency between two threads via a busy channel. Such a channel provides faster communication than a mutex-based one where the number of threads is identical to the hardware concurrency. To evaluate communication performance, a communication time benchmark is used alongside a selection time benchmark. The communication time benchmark is scaled to evaluate the impact of thread counts greater than the available hardware. Results show that an above ten-times improvement in communication time is possible when the hardware supports the threads fully. The improvement drops as further threads are added to the system due to operating system scheduling taking over the determination of thread activeness. Selection time similarly shows improvement when thread count matches hardware, but likewise reduces as thread count increases. We can conclude that a busy channel is useful in an environment where the thread count matches the available hardware, which is of interest to parallel application developers or control systems with similar properties.",60018186,Edinburgh Napier University,Edinburgh,United Kingdom,['1700'],19.555555555555557,0.09166666666666666,0.37166666666666676,0

In particular, new approaches and rules for determining the syntax and semantic links between terms in the text and the directions of these links between nodes in undirected networks of terms constructed from terms of a thematic text corpus, are proposed and researched. Also, one of the methods for creating terminological ontologies – the algorithm for building the thematic networks of natural hierarchies of terms based on analysis of texts corpora – is considered and used to build a directed network of words and phrases (separate unigrams, bigrams and threegrams). The well-known fairy tale “The story of Little Red Riding Hood” is provided as examples to demonstrate an accuracy of the proposed rules. The Python programming language and its separate functions of a specialized add-in - the module NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit open source library) is used to create the software realization of the proposed and considered approaches and methods. Using the software for modelling and visualization of graphs - Gephi, the built directed networks of terms were visualized for better visual perception. The proposed approach can be used for automatically creating terminological ontologies of subject domains with the participation of experts.

It will appear as azimuth interference sidebands and decrease image quality seriously. Therefore, studying the micro-Doppler suppression problem in practical applications is of great importance in high-quality imaging of ISAR. In this paper, a reasonable and effective mathematical model is established, and the m-D suppression algorithm inspired by the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) matrix reconstruction theory is proposed.

398,398,Co-simulation design towards cyber-physical robotic applications leveraging on FMI standard and CSP semantics," All rights reserved.Designing software controllers for multi-task automated service robotics is becoming increasingly complex. The combination of discrete-time (cyber) and continuous-time (physical) domains and multiple engineering fields makes it quite challenging to couple different subsystems as a whole for further verification and validation. Co-simulation is nowadays used to evaluate connected subsystems in the very early design phase and in an iterative development manner. Leveraging on our previous efforts for a Model-Driven Development and simulation approach, that mainly focused on the software architecture, we propose a co-simulation approach adopting the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard to co-simulate the software controller with modelled physical plant dynamics. A model coupling approach is defined that involves the model transformation from a physical plant model implementing the FMI interface (denoted as a Functional Mock-up Unit, FMU) to a Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) model. The Master Algorithm is (semi-)automatically generated from a co-simulation model that is formalised with CSP syntax to orchestrate the communication between different FMUs. Additionally, an optimized algorithm is defined to compensate for the artificial delay existing in a feedback loop. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the co-simulation approach, verify its working (at least, for this example) and to analyse the timing compensation algorithm.",60020599,University of Twente,Enschede,Netherlands,['1700'],25.5,0.004444444444444451,0.4482539682539683,0
399,399,DynExit: A Dynamic Early-Exit Strategy for Deep Residual Networks,"Early-exit is a kind of technique to terminate a pre-specified computation at an early stage depending on the input samples and has been introduced to reduce energy consumption for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Previous early-exit approaches suffered from the burden of manually tuning early-exit loss-weights to find a good trade-off between complexity reduction and system accuracy. In this work, we first propose DynExit, a dynamic loss-weight modification strategy for ResNets, which adaptively modifies the ratio of different exit branches and searches for a proper spot for both accuracy and cost. Then, an efficient hardware unit for early-exit branches is developed, which can be easily integrated to existing hardware architectures of DNNs to reduce average computing latency and energy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed DynExit strategy can reduce up to 43.6% FLOPS compared to the state-of-The-Arts approaches. On the other hand, it is able to achieve 1.2% accuracy improvement over the existing end-To-end fixed loss-weight training scheme with comparable computation reduction ratio. The proposed hardware architecture for DynExit is evaluated on the platform of Xilinx Zynq-7000 ZC706 development board. Synthesis results demonstrate that the architecture can achieve high speed with low hardware complexity.

This is conditioned by the need to maintain the resilience and stability in the operation of computer systems with a reconstructible structure and programmable logic under various conditions of adverse effects of external and internal factors, both natural and technogenic, as well as those human-induced. It has been found that neutralizing threats and minimizing losses caused by abnormal, critical, emergency and catastrophic situations leading to an avalanche-like increase in degradation processes and destruction of computer systems with a reconstructible structure and programmable logic, requires the development of new principles, approaches, ways and methods of operational monitoring, analysis and forecasting of situations, development of options for control decisions, procedures for their selection and implementation in the framework of theory of structural dynamics control. To solve the optimization problem of constructing scenarios for the structural reconfiguration of computer systems with a reconstructible structure and programmable logic, a method and an algorithm that implements this method are proposed.

404,404,Cooperative Traffic Control where Autonomous Cars Meet Human Drivers,"Co-adaptive system is a close coupling between human and software system cooperating to achieve shared goals. This co-adaption requires adaptive actions to react to unpredictable circumstances. One of the challenges is to deal with uncertainties, and consequently, decision making under uncertainty, which may arise because of the change in the environment, the unpredictable resources, etc. Human behavior does contribute to large amounts of uncertainty. This paper presents an approach for using a simulator as a means of feedback to a human's decision under uncertainty that can assist human in automated planning to generate cooperative and symbiotic strategy of human and the system to achieve given tasks.

416,416,Redefined Power Quality Indices for Stationary and Nonstationary Power Quality Disturbances,"The recommended power quality (PQ) indices for electric power systems are defined based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). DFT is mostly evaluated applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm which requires signals to be periodic in nature and therefore provides accurate results in case of stationary PQ disturbances only. In case of nonstationary disturbances, signals become aperiodic in nature, and FFT produces erroneous results due to spectral leakage phenomena. In addition, FFT is incapable of providing any time information, which is a significant property when dealing with time-varying PQ disturbances. FFT can provide only amplitude-frequency spectra of the signals. Thereby this paper presents a framework of redefining stationary and nonstationary PQ disturbances employing time-frequency distribution (TFD) method. Reduced interference distribution (RID), which is a member of Cohen's class TFD, is studied here to define and formulate PQ indices for electric power systems. RID represents the most suitable properties in case of time-varying PQ disturbances comparing with other TFD methods.

431,431,Distributed Energy Resources Optimization for Wireless Base Stations using Power Amplifier Switching,"With the increased deployment of cellular networks due to advanced transmission techniques, overall energy consumption of the telecommunication sector across the globe has grown. Numerous challenges for operators are springing up including the escalating number of base station (BS) sites and also the increasing operation cost as well as environmental impacts due to the use of sources such as fossil fuel. Therefore, to achieve optimization in power consumption of cellular network, global network operators are deploying different energy-saving strategies. In this paper, a simple software-based effective power amplifier switching algorithm requiring no change of infrastructure is proposed to save a significant amount of energy at the base station using a real-time traffic scenario. The proposed algorithm uses the Transmit Channel Allocation method to switch the power amplifier ON/OFF at the transceivers of BS sites automatically based on the continuous traffic analysis. To validate the proposed algorithm, a model consisting of 5 BSs with a solar system is considered, and the power amplifier switching algorithm is run via Matlab at these BSs to record the hourly power consumption over the year. The resulting optimized BSs power load represents a 17.31% reduction in average power consumption over the course of one year.

For physiological signals telemonitoring of wearable devices, chip area and power efficiency need to be considered simultaneously. There are many prior studies aim to develop algorithms that applied to CS reconstruction chips with reconfigurable architecture. However, representative dictionaries are also important when these CS reconstruction chips are verified in real-Time physiological signals monitoring tasks. That is, a more representative dictionary can not only enhance the reconstruction performance of these chips but also alleviate memory overhead. In this paper, we apply the concept of co-design between sparse coding algorithms and learned dictionaries. We also explore the representativeness and compatibility of each learned dictionary. In addition, the computational complexity of each reconstruction algorithm is provided through simulations. Our results show that the dictionaries trained by fast iterative shrinkage-Thresholding algorithm (FISTA) are more representative according to the quality of reconstruction for physiological signals monitoring.

Energy storage is considerably applied to increase the reliability of hybrid renewable energy system (HRES), in which wind and solar energy is heavily influenced by the weather conditions. This paper aims to develop an environmental-friendly and cost-effective power system for residential community of Basco island in the Philippines which can replace the current system powered by the diesel generator only. Following the site data collection, the investigation of hybrid solar PV, wind, diesel generator, and battery systems was carried out to determine the optimal sizing of the system components based on some technical and economic criteria, such as system reliability, net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE). Different scenarios sensitivity analysis of HRESs were simulated by HOMER software. Small capacity wind turbine was also considered for some benefits of power generation at low wind speed, investment cost and system construction and maintenance. In addition, a hybrid AC/DC link and control strategy for power balance between load and electricity production was applied to increase the system efficiency and reliability. From the optimization results, it could be concluded that the combination of system components, including solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, battery storage and diesel generator is considerably suitable for the applied area and further application for rural and islanding electrification.

The main drawback of using threads and processes is that they limit the number of CSP processes that a program can use due to operating system restrictions and memory and synchronisation overheads. This overhead is reduced when using greenlets, but requires the use of an external library. aPyCSP is an experimental implementation of PyCSP that uses recent support for coroutines in Python and the asyncio library. This paper explores two implementation approaches for aPyCSP where the most recent version is shorter, simpler to read and understand and supports more functionality than the original version, including generic channel support and input and output guards.

This paper presents a novel post-filtering to a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming which is a single-channel modified complementary joint sparse representations (M-CJSR) method. First, MVDR beamformer is used to suppress interference and noise. Subsequently, the proposed M-CJSR approach based on joint dictionary learning is applied as a single microphone post-filter to process the beamformer output. Different from the existing post-filtering techniques which rely on the assumptions about the noise field, this algorithm considers a more generalized signal model including the ambient noise, like diffuse noise or white noise, as well as the point-source interference. Moreover, the original CJSR method is extended to jointly learn dictionaries for not only the mappings from mixture to speech and noise, but also the mapping from mixture to interference. In order to take the complementary advantages of different sparse representations, we design the weighting parameters based on the residual components of the estimated signals.

However, the required lasers are a cause of concern for the safe operation of such laser power beaming systems. Tissue damage to eyes and skin from direct beam exposure as well as the general burning hazards from these class 4 lasers need be addressed. In an attempt resolve these risks and validate LPB applications with readily available components, laboratory tests of this wireless power transfer method were performed. It was demonstrated that a 10-watt 976nm continuous wave laser utilized in conjunction with monocrystalline silicon photovoltaics successfully powered a small remote-controlled vehicle and an Arduino temperature sensor respectively in the lab while skin hazards from direct beam exposure were eliminated with an enlarged laser beam diameter of 9 cm.

This is really relevant and important so modern algorithms for the churn probability forecasting are needed. The authors proposed such approach which focused not only on the probability but also on the time period when the churn can happen. For this reason two algorithms, based on the using of survival functions and forecasting the churn time period, were developed. First algorithm for forecasting the time period for risk increasing was based on the critical total losses. The second one was based on the survival probability, defined by the company and really depended from its strategy and the situation on market. If the risk function is determined in the process of modeling through parametric, nonparametric distribution, then the calculation of time through the derived risk function is possible. Using and results of the proposed algorithms for the set of risk probability thresholds is shown on the IBM dataset. Different types of models such as semi-parametric Cox Proportional Model and parametric Weibull and Log-normal survival models were used. The log-normal model was defined as the best model by such statistical criteria as a log-likelihood value. Also a step-by-step outflow process in decision support system for churn detection and defining in time the most dangerous groups of clients who are thinking to churn was proposed.",60003172,National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”,Kiev,Ukraine,['1700'],21.545454545454547,0.15,0.5563492063492064,0

490,490,Concurrency issues in ordinary place transition Petri Nets, All rights reserved.This paper explains concurrency issues present when modeling software systems using ordinary place transition nets. Normally it is assumed that ordinary (elementary) Petri net structures are concurrent or concurrency free. However it can be shown that concurrency does not depend only on the structure of a Petri net but on the distribution of resources in the net. A basic algebraic notation is used for representing concurrency. Examples are given showing different types of concurrency that can be detected in ordinary Petri net structures. These are classified into i) dependent and ii) temporal (weak) concurrency.,60072651,L-Università ta' Malta,Msida,Malta,['1700'],16.166666666666664,-0.01833333333333333,0.4133333333333333,0

Paper-based electrodes offer significant cost advantage compared to electrodes fabricated using standard clean room microfabrication techniques. The three-electrode system used in this paper does not use inks or pastes, and can be prepared easily by writing on chromatography paper with store-bought pencils. The electrode fabrication procedure is simple and uses widely available materials making them easy and usable for fabrication and use in remote areas and underdeveloped countries. The potentiostat is implemented using discrete electronics for the control amplifier and two versions of the transimpedance amplifier are presented. The system is characterized using cyclic voltammetry and amperometry.

492,492,Evaluating Side Channel Resilience in iPhone 5c Unlock Scenarios,"iOS is one of the most secure operating systems based on policies created and enforced by Apple. Though not impervious or free from vulnerabilities, iOS has remained resilient to many attacks partially based on lower market share of devices, but primarily because of tight controls placed on iOS development and application deployment. Locked iOS devices pose a specific hard problem for both law enforcement and corporate IT dealing with malicious insiders or intrusion scenarios. The need to recover forensic data from locked iOS devices has been of public interest for some time. In this paper, we describe a case study analysis of the iPhone 5c model and our attempts to use electromagnetic (EM) fault-injection as a side channel means to unlock the device. Based on our study, we report on our unsuccessful attempts in unlocking a locked iPhone 5c using this side channel-based approach.

493,493,EAGLE: Exploiting Essential Address in Both Weight and Activation to Accelerate CNN Computing,"Efficient quantization techniques can compress Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with less bit-width while maintaining the accuracy on large extent. However, the quantized CNN models hardly boost the computation performance of CNN accelerators with the conventional bit-parallel Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. Previous works proposed a shifting-based bit-serial operation, which can be called as Shift-Accumulate (SAC) operation, to take advantage of the reduced bit-width. However, it is also found that there are many invalid computations in both MAC and SAC operation, caused by zero bits in activations and weights, which are not optimized. To fully exploit the computations in CNN models, we proposed a Essen-Tial Address only GAC based Low-latency Efficient (EAGLE) architecture that can further accelerate the CNN computation through bypassing zero bits computation in the activations and weights. An essential address is adopted to encode the nonzero bits in activations and weights in this architecture. Furthermore, to support the essential address-only computations, Generate-Accumulate (GAC), an operation which produces partial sums with essential addresses, is implemented. The architecture is implemented with a TSMC 28nm CMOS technology. Based on the results, if scaled in a 65nm technology, the EAGLE only requires 63.6% area and 43.1% power consumption compare to that of the Pragmatic. The EAGLE reaches an average speedup of 2.08\times and 1.43\times on six CNN models over the Stripe and Pragmatic at a similar frequency, respectively. It also improves energy efficiency by 3.69\times on average over the DaDianNao baseline.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"['1711', '1708']",21.545454545454547,-0.026680672268907565,0.41533613445378154,1

It is, therefore, an important tool for government and business in planning and responding to societal needs including the ability of first responders to react more confidently in the case of major events such as hurricanes or terrorist attacks. A starting point is to estimate the maximum capacity of parking lots, and then to estimate an occupancy factor at a given hour. In this paper, we aim to present the use of image processing to help detect the maximum capacity of a parking lot from aerial imagery, such as those available at Google maps.

501,501,Empirical Validation of System Dynamics Cyber Security Models,"Model validation, though a process that's continuous and complex, establishes confidence in the soundness and usefulness of a model. Making sure that the model behaves similar to the modes of behavior seen in real systems, allows the builder of said model to assure accumulation of confidence in the model and thus validating the model. While doing this, the model builder is also required to build confidence from a target audience in the model through communicating to the bases. The basis of the system dynamics model validation, both in general and in the field of cyber security, relies on a casual loop diagram of the system being agreed upon by a group of experts. Model validation also uses formal quantitative and informal qualitative tools in addition to the validation techniques used by system dynamics. Amongst others, the usefulness of a model, in a user's eyes, is a valid standard by which we can evaluate them.

502,502,Towards a Reactive Game Engine,"Developing new ways to improve game engines and enabling the creation of more accurate experiences is an important issue, especially for real-time applications such as Virtual Reality. As this technology has evolved, the gap between rendered frames has become smaller and environments have become more complex. As a result, mistakes can arise with regard to order-dependent events. Often these mistakes result in a temporarily unstable state in the environment, and may not be visible because of the time lapse between rendered frames. These errors are compounded by events which are not directly driven by the game engine, such as user movement and input. There is a continuous interaction between the user and the environment and the precise actions that user may take often cannot be predicted a priori.Reactive programming is a still evolving paradigm that has been employed in many different applications such as robotics and user interfaces.

509,509,Interference Reduction in Multicarrier CDMA Via Blind Minimum Variance Multiuser Detector,"This paper investigates the problem of reducing interference via an adaptive minimum variance (AMV) receiver in the Multi - Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC CDMA) forward link. In the MC - CDMA forward link, receivers are decentralized hence a computationally traceable approach to filter design is via adaptive estimation. It is well known that explicit training reduces the spectral efficiency of communication channels subject to time variation, while on the other hand, implicit training (i.e. Blind estimation) is not capacity preserving for noisy channels. It is necessary, therefore, to consider whether any potential advantage can be gained capacity wise in using implicit training for slowly time varying channels where some degree of channel estimation error can be expected. In this paper, the AMV algorithm is examined for MC - CDMA where results are presented indicating that for BPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM modulation, the probability of error and capacity are nearly identical to the LMS MMSE approach provided that perfect channel side information (CSI) is available at the receiver.

510,510,Forecasting the Success of Television Series using Machine Learning,"Television is an ever-evolving multi-billion-dollar industry. The success of a television show in an increasingly technological society is a vast multi-variable formula. The art of success is not just something that happens, but is studied, replicated, and applied. Hollywood can be unpredictable regarding success, as many movies and sitcoms that are hyped up and promise to be a hit end up being box office failures and complete disappointments. In current studies, linguistic exploration is being performed on the relationship between Television series and target community of viewers. Having a decision support system that can display sound and predictable results would be needed to build confidence in the investment of a new TV series. The models presented in this study use data to study and determine what makes a sitcom successful. In this paper, we use descriptive and predictive modeling techniques to assess the continuing success of television comedies: The Office, Big Bang Theory, Arrested Development, Scrubs, and South Park. The factors that are tested for statistical significance on episode ratings are character presence, director, and writer. These statistics show that while characters are indeed crucial to the shows themselves, the creation and direction of the shows pose implication upon the ratings and therefore the success of the shows. We use machine learning based forecasting models such as linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Decision Tree and Forests, Neural Network, and Facebook Prophet, to accurately predict the success of shows. The models represent a baseline to understanding the success of a television show and how producers can increase the success of current television shows or utilize this data in the creation of future shows. Due to the many factors that go into a series, the empirical analysis in this work shows that there is no one-fits-all model to forecast the rating or success of a television show. However, because the variables are statistically significant, they are still able to optimize and affect the rating positively.",60022144,University of Central Florida,Orlando,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",23.285714285714285,0.20312805474095794,0.3704301075268817,1
511,511,Information Capacity of Implicit Receiver Training in Unknown MIMO Channels,"The capacity of a channel subject to frequency selective fading is a fundamentally well known result when perfect channel side information (CSI) or explicit training is available at the receiver for performing MMSE MIMO estimation. However, in practical wireless applications, the channel estimation problem operates initially without full knowledge of the channel parameters. This problem expatiates further when the channel is time varying, where a continually transmitting source may need to expend a significant portion of its resources on training. The capacity for training based MMSE MIMO estimation is well known where the redundancy incurred depends on the rate at which the channel varies. On the other hand, implicit training based (Blind) estimation does not require the transmission of known Pilot symbols with the cost that the signaling alphabet cannot generally be Gaussian when utilizing methods involving steepest descent or higher order statistics. In this paper, a subspace method (the MUSIC algorithm) of estimation is investigated and compared with two other techniques, namely the Goddard algorithm and the MMSE algorithm). It is shown that the MUSIC algorithm can approach the explicit MMSE training capacity of 5bits/Hz within 1dB for a very slow varying fading channel. It is also shown that for a channel subject to a more significant time variation, up to 2dB improvement can be realized with implicit training for less than 4bits/Hz capacity.",60014723,West Virginia University Institute of Technology,Beckley,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",28.125,0.0976470588235294,0.49235294117647066,1
512,512,Measuring Compute-Reuse Opportunities for Video Processing Acceleration,"Increases in bandwidth for mobile and land-line networks enables devices to communicate video at higher image and audio resolution. Processing these video streams is of interest for a wide-ranging collection of applications including robotic recognition and navigation, video security surveillance, action recognition and augmented virtual reality. The advent of massively parallel Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) has met many computing challenges in processing video in real time. Yet, GPU computing works best when the algorithm and structure of the image data can be regularized into locally-independent compute threads. When these regularity constraints do not hold or if the computational complexity of the local thread is high, GPU computing solutions can be overwhelmed by the computational task at hand. This article provides initial research results to explore an alternative approach for computation classically referred to as 'memoization.' Here input and output values of computationally expensive functions are stored on a 'memo' Look-Up Table (LUT) and when an input re-occurs, the corresponding output value is taken from the LUT without computation. Research work implements a memoization system to investigate the extent of compute re-use that exists within streaming video data. Insights are provided specifying new techniques that efficiently transform traditional memoization approaches into approximate memoization methods which open up new design spaces to explore the tradeoff between accuracy and computational cost. Here one may enhance compute re-use by allowing similar input values to map to the same output having an end-effect similar to approximate computing. Experimental results for 2D convolution (stencil() function) on data from six videos shows reuse of 50% with no loss in the computation accuracy. Our experimental results also show approximate memoization increases reuse to rates ranging from 75% up to 99%.",60006951,The University of North Carolina at Charlotte,Charlotte,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",25.636363636363637,0.03678030303030303,0.3676704545454545,1
513,513,Development of a Smart IoT Charger for Wearable Cigarette Smoking Monitor,"Wearable sensors have been proven effective for the objective detection of smoking events and individual puffs. For a precise analysis of the smoking habit of a person, these sensing methods need to be thoroughly applied for weeks or months. However, the limitation of sensor battery longevity, concern for sensors' timestamp drift or parameter calibration, and the restricted sensor data evaluation process limit this long-term application and force subjects, participating in the smoking study, for frequent returns to lab facilities. Also, sensor data analysis reports such as the statistics of daily cigarette consumption are not instantly available to smokers. Addressing these limitations, a smart IoT charger based on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) is presented in this paper, which can serve to a) recharge the sensor battery b) update the sensor timestamp c) exchange control commands d) extract data from the sensor system and, e) instant upload of sensor data to a cloud server to store and process sensor signals. To validate the proposed system, two volunteer smokers applied the wrist inertial sensor of a wearable sensor system for five consecutive days and used the proposed RPi charger daily. The difference in charging current provided by the smart charger and the commercial wall charger was found to be less than 0.1%. For sensor files of ∼100KB size, the average file transfer rates and upload rates were found to be 3.25 MBps and 1.04 MBps, respectively, which was satisfactory for the current application.

We present the basic hardware and software architectures of the Distributed Arctic Observatory (DAO) observation units. A DAO observation unit is composed of both heavy and light computer cores. The idea is to use the heavy cores for resource demanding tasks and then power them off and shift the workload to light cores when possible in order to increase energy efficiency and extend battery life. We report on initial thoughts and experiences in applying a CSP network on an observation unit to ease development of advanced functionalities, while still achieving energy efficiency for observation units. In order to rapidly develop prototype systems and learn from them, we have composed observation units with a combination of Raspberry Pi computers as the heavy cores, and Arduino, Nucleo, and Sleepy Pi microcontrollers as the light cores.

517,517,On Secrecy Energy Efficiency of RF Energy Harvesting System,"The increasing use of information source in unreliable wireless communication is a driving force to explore the networks' energy efficiency and security. To fully improve the performance of the system, in this paper, we combine these two directions and investigate the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of the network in which the information can be eavesdropped consisting of an energy source, an information source, a destination and an eavesdrop node, all of which are equipped with single antenna. The system model is based on ST (save-Then-Transmit) protocol. The information source node harvests energy from the received signal power to charge its battery, which is used to retransmit the received signal to the destination. Under the limited transmit power mode, we get the expression for SEE, which depends on energy absorption rate and time. Our analytical results reveal that the secrecy efficiency has a maximum. The optimal energy absorption rate was further calculated by Newton iterative algorithm. Then we propose optimal energy source selection method.

It’s substantiated, that security of critical infrastructures functioning depends on the level of survivability of automated organizational management systems (OMS). Increasing the survivability of automated organizational management systems is an essential element of a secure risk management system for critical infrastructures. The survivability property of automated OMS is defined as their ability to retain their functionality by performing the set of functions necessary to achieve the goal of functioning with a given quality, in the context of accumulation of component damages and loss of resources, by changing the behavior of the system. The survivability states of automated OMS are classified. A model is proposed to investigate the survivability of an automated OMS regarding a set of functions aimed at ensuring the security of critical infrastructure functioning. The methodological aspects of the development and implementation of the automated OMS are highlighted, that will function in the conditions of permanent changes of the environment and modernization of the components of the OMS.

An integrated survivability index has been proposed to evaluate the survivability and functional degradation of the OMS.

532,532,Towards Algebraic Modeling of GPU Memory Access for Bank Conflict Mitigation,"Graphics Processing Units (GPU) have been widely used in various fields of scientific computing, such as in signal processing. GPUs have a hierarchical memory structure with memory layers that are shared between GPU processing elements. Partly due to the complex memory hierarchy, GPU programming is non-Trivial, and several aspects must be taken into account, one being memory access patterns. One of the fastest GPU memory layers, shared memory, is grouped into banks to enable fast, parallel access for processing elements. Unfortunately, it may happen that multiple threads of a GPU program may access the same shared memory bank simultaneously causing a bank conflict. If this happens, program execution slows down as memory accesses have to be rescheduled to determine which instruction to execute first. Bank conflicts are not taken into account automatically by the compiler, and hence the programmer must detect and deal with them prior to program execution. In this paper, we present an algebraic approach to detect bank conflicts and prove some theoretical results that can be used to predict when bank conflicts happen and how to avoid them.

541,541,False Glitch Cells as a Countermeasure Against Power Analysis Attacks in Cryptographic Circuits,"Cryptographic systems can potentially suffer from various attacks which are a consequence of vulnearability of side channel information to analysis attacks. The nature of digital circuits is prone to electromagnetic and power analysis (EMA and PA) attacks. Interconnects in cryptographic circuits emanate information through electromagnetic signals which can be exploited using EMA. Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits are vulnearable to leak of computational information through leakage and dynamic power consumption. Dynamic power consumption of cryptographic engines is a rich source to sink in the data under process. The hardware implementation of cryptographic algorithms undermine the security of encrypted system against non brute-force-attacks. The attackers collect and analyse the leakage information of cryptographic circuits to detect the secrete key. The parameters sensitivity of the device and circuits make the cryptographic engines vulnearable to fault injection and inherent inconsistency of the circuits. Dynamic and static power comprise two major components of power consumption of digital circuits. Both power components vary with data under process. This exhibits power consumption has data dependency in digital circuits. To make noisy power profile, various countermeasures have been proposed against Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks.

By removing distance barriers, it improves access to different services that would often not be regularly available in distant rural communities. It also saves lives in critical scenarios like healthcare, oil field inspection, monitoring oil and gas pipelines, and security. Wireless networks constantly suffer from different factors like bad weather conditions, fading and multipath interference, which lead to weak signals entailing packet losses or delays and rendering unacceptable video quality. This paper represents a performance study of link budget analysis (LBA) for short-range operation of remote sensing and its effects on video quality, in which both experimental and theoretical levels have been considered. The analysis presented is based on measurements conducted in a complex environment, such as an open field by the Computer Center building of the University of Birmingham during the snowy weather with surrounding vegetation. The link budget is calculated by initially measuring the input received power of a transmitted continuous wave (CW) signal at 2.45 GHz frequency at different distances from the transmitter, and then calculating the path loss for each scenario while taking the fading effect into account. Measured path loss was compared to the Two Ray (Ground Reflection) and Free Space Path Loss models in order to describe the received power for the specified remote sensing system.

A commonly known technique for root assessment is to take the plant from its environment and check for diseases and put it back to its environment, which can cause stress on the plant and can lead the death of it. Having these evaluations inside the plants environment will not put any stress on the plants and will allow researchers to take multiple samples without harming the roots.

The flagellum is made from silicone and ferrofluidic liquid which consists billions of iron molecules. Rotation of radially located motors with permanent magnets attached to the tips of their shaft creates a controllable magnetic field that influences the iron molecules inside the flagellum and can change the orientation of it.

549,549,Degree Validation Application Using Solidity and Ethereum Blockchain,"One of the most common actions for students post-graduation is requesting a degree validation or an official transcript of grades. Requests for degree validations happen for various reasons such as an employment requirement, a pursuit of a higher degree education, foreign degree accreditation, or even for a personal reason. Those who are requesting the degree validation are usually on a time constraint. Traditional methods of degree validation are often complicated, time consuming, require manpower to maintain, and potentially have security or privacy issues. We present a software application implementing an automatic degree validation system that uses the Ethereum, an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform, and that features smart contract functionality. The application is developed using Solidity, a contract-oriented programming language, and is run by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This application allows students and universities to automatically verify each other's identity while maintaining transaction validity and referential integrity through a blockchain ledger and maintaining security through PGP key authentication. The university checks the student's request against its own secure mongoDB database. Our application also generates the student's Ehereum wallet using the Truffle development Ethereum network. Truffle generates the student's private and public keys. Our Application pulls the student public key, hashes the last 20 bytes, generates Keccak256 Hash, and stores it on the MongoDB as the student Ethereum Address. To ensure the information's privacy, the blocks of the blockchain are mainly formed of two encrypted fields using the Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) library. The first field is encrypted using the student's public key and the second field is encrypted using the third party public field. Third parties, such as employers or other higher education institutions, are able to check its encrypted field of the block using its own private key, once the degree is validated or the transcript is generated. Results of testing show our application to be scalable, secure, have efficient gas costs on the Ethereum network, and minimize human interaction.",60012433,Guilford College,Greensboro,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",21.666666666666668,0.06843786295005806,0.4477932636469223,1
550,550,Leader-Follower Controls in Systems with Two Controllers,"The classical control theory deals with dynamical systems that are controlled by one controller designed to ensure maximum performance of the system over a specific interval of time. More recently, there has been considerable interest in systems that are controlled by more than one controller. In this paper, we consider control systems that are controlled by two independent controllers whose roles and objectives in terms of the performance of the system are generally different. More specifically, we consider systems where one controller has an advantage over the other in that it has the capability of designing and implementing its control first, before the other controller. With such control hierarchy this controller is designated as leader and the other as follower. To take advantage of its primary role, the leader control is designed by anticipating and taking into consideration the follower's control. The follower becomes the sole controller in the system after the leader's control has been implemented. In this paper, we describe such systems and derive in detail the controls of both, the leader and follower. We consider an economic control system that models the behavior of two firms in a dynamic market where one firm is more powerful than the other and as a result assumes the role of a market leader. We derive the general conditions that govern the existence of the leader and follower's control functions.

The distribution of temporal-difference errors (TD errors) is first segmented. The experience for network training is classified according to its updated TD error. Then, a swap mechanism for similar experiences is implemented to change the lifetimes of experiences in the replay buffer.

Tertiary control is at the highest control level, considering economic concerns related to the optimal operation of the microgrid and using a sampling time from minutes to hours; tertiary controls manage the flow of power between the microgrid and the connected grid. In MMGs' tertiary controls, the use of optimization algorithms to minimize an objective function with equality and inequality constraints allows for powerful control over the system. In this paper, the interior-point algorithm is proposed and utilized in order to minimize the required objective. The suggested method is robust against weather conditions and accommodates varying demands in both ac and dc grids. To perform optimization and simulations, MATLAB outputs a lookup table, which can be easily implemented into any system. This is a 2-dimensional array with ac load requirements on the rows and dc load requirements on the columns.

Since the spectral peak search is inevitable for the current RARE algorithm, it may bring a huge occupational load for practical implementations. In order to reduce the computational com-plexity, in this paper, we propose a root-RARE algorithm for DOA estimation with partly calibrated uniform linear arrays (ULAs).

569,569,GAMESPECT: Aspect Oriented Programming for a Video Game Engine using Meta-languages,"Video game programming is an area where code duplication is extremely prevalent. Similar types of tasks are performed in multiple places throughout a game engine codebase. For example: game balance, logging, and memory allocation are just a few of the areas which are located across disparate locations of the codebase. Meanwhile, aspect oriented programming (AOP) was created to make use of common themes in a codebase and allow for advice to be given during compilation or runtime. GAMESPECT is a Domain Specific language (DSL) which resides in a higher level language space, above the typical languages used by game engines such as Unreal Engine 4. The language is written with the popular XText language toolset and contains advices in the spirit of aspect oriented programming: point cuts and join points. These advices can be executed at runtime when the programmer wants to finetune values or perform debugging. The advising is made possible through the Clang toolchain. Unique to this approach, GAMESPECT takes a source language and converts into multiple target languages. Depending on the context, GAMESPECT can generate C++, LUA, Blueprints or Skookum Script. This type of source to source translation is made possible through GAMESPECT's 'composition specifications'. With GAMESPECT, video game designers can increase their productivity and reduce the required lines of code for certain tasks by a 9-40% reduction. In addition, it provides for an AOP platform which is agnostic to the underlying game code. The applicability of this approach extends beyond game programming into software engineering as a whole.",60019600,Nova Southeastern University,Fort Lauderdale,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",18.0,-0.07009523809523813,0.45985714285714285,1

576,576,Detection of Visual Signals for Pneumonia in Chest Radiographs using Weak Supervision,"Pneumonia usually manifests as areas of increased opacity in chest radiographs. Diagnosing pneumonia often requires a review of a chest radiograph by highly trained specialists. Automatic identification of regions of interest in chest radiographs could be an initial step in prioritizing radiology worklist for radiologists to review. In this paper, we show how to exploit class-activation mapping and weak supervision to automatically localize regions in chest radio-graphs exhibiting signs of pneumonia. For this research project, we evaluate a dataset of 30,000 chest radiographs collected by the Radiology Society of Northern America (RSNA). Data was annotated by six board-certified radiologists who provided bounding boxes to specify lesion location. We investigated the utility of weak supervision for detecting visual signs of pneumonia in chest radiograph (CXR). We formulate the problem as one of inference in binary pneumonia classification. Binary classification only requires a binary label indicating the presence of pneumonia as opposed to bounding boxes or detailed annotations outlining the regions of interest. We compared the regions of interest identified by our approach and a data-set of chest x-rays with detained ROI bounding box annotations prepared by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in collaboration with the US National Institutes of Health, We show that our approach achieves good correlation intersection-over-union with the radiologists ground truth annotations from the (RSNA) dataset.

However, the signal processing related to CNNs is computationally very demanding, which has prohibited their use in the smallest embedded computing platforms, to which many Internet of Things (IoT) devices belong. Fortunately, in the recent years researchers have developed many approaches for optimizing the performance and for shrinking the memory footprint of CNNs. This paper presents a neural-network-based image classifier that has been trained to classify vehicle images into four different classes. The neural network is optimized by a technique called binarization, and the resulting binarized network is placed to an IoT-class processor core for execution. Binarization reduces the memory footprint of the CNN by around 95% and increases performance by more than 6 \times . Furthermore, we show that by utilizing a custom instruction 'popcount' of the processor, the performance of the binarized vehicle classifier can still be increased by more than 2 \times , making the CNN-based image classifier suitable for the smallest embedded processors.",60011170,Tampereen Yliopisto,Tampere,Finland,"['1711', '1708']",26.285714285714285,0.23717948717948717,0.4589743589743589,1
578,578,Computational Enhancement in Locating Unknown Sub-Pixel Anomalous Sources in Hyperspectral Images,"The outcome of this research developed a new qualitative image processing approach to finding subpixel level anomalies in hyperspectral imagery. There were several steps involved in this process and there were 2 phases. First, anomalies were placed in the input hyperspectral image. In Phase 1, we chose a set of random chips or random pixels which were from the NxMxP hyperspectral image. Here the number of rows, columns, and bands of the hyperspectral image corresponds with N, M, and P respectively. A metric involving edge and turbulence is computed for each 3x3 neighborhood of pixels in the image. From this, a function is constructed where the domain (i.e. horizontal axis) is the band number and the range (i.e., vertical axis) is the corresponding 'edge divided by turbulence' value after a first thresholding is applied. Throughout the paper, 'edge divided by turbulence' is referred to as E/T. A second threshold is applied to this E/T function to determine the optimal bands to select from the hyperspectral image. In Phase 2, a transition into determining the probability of detection and probability of false alarm by adjusting the incongruence threshold H is performed. For this effort, a suite of Matlab tools was developed detailing information related to probability of detection (POD) and false alarm rate (FAR) for varying levels of contamination, incongruence, and band thresholding. A 224-band hyperspectral image was used as the evaluation image for this effort. The result of this effort was a generic workflow for determination of subpixel anomalies in any hyperspectral image.",60008740,Alabama A and M University,Huntsville,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",18.071428571428573,-0.05757575757575759,0.3614141414141414,1

The tree-based search algorithm searches for the best grid structure for adaptively partitioning the image into blocks of varying sizes.

580,580,Signal Processing Techniques to Evaluate Surface Roughness of Weathered Rock Specimens,"Weathering of rock surfaces results in an increase in the surface roughness of the rock. This surface can be assessed quantitatively using a number of statistical methods, typically granting a single-value measure of approximate roughness and, by extension, an approximate degree of weathering. In recent years the techniques developed by electrical and signal engineers for analyzing signals have been applied to this surface roughness characterization. Seven core samples of limestone rock were scanned and converted into linear profiles along the surface of the rock samples. The signal energy (Es) and Z2, two single-value roughness measures, were calculated from these samples and Fourier and wavelet transforms were applied as well. The wavelet coefficients were then averaged, yielding a third single-value roughness measure. All three single-value roughness measures demonstrate remarkable agreement with one another with the exception of Z2, which estimates the roughness of one profile as slightly higher than two other profiles. This inconsistency appears to be due to an atypically high frequency content in that profile, exaggerating the measure of Z2. The wavelet transform technique proves to be very effective at locating sharp discontinuities along a rock at both low and high frequencies, promising better generalization to broader types of samples.",60006996,Lowe's,Morrisville,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",22.333333333333332,0.10324074074074073,0.4655555555555555,1

The increase of data scale and modalities demands for codecs dedicated to these sensorial data. In this paper, we propose a codec for compression of vibrotactile data in the spirit of Weber's law. To be specific, a companding function is applied to the vibrotactile data, so that the quantisation step of high amplitude is larger than that of low amplitude. The curve of the companding function is optimised through a data-driven approach. To evaluate the performance of the vibrotactile codec in terms of human perceived quality, rigorous subjective tests are conducted. The results demonstrate that 75% compression of vibrotactile data is achieved without perceivable degradation. More importantly, the computational complexity is much lower and the latency performance is superior, compared with other vibrotactile codecs. The computational complexity of the proposed codec is about 1/20 of that of previous codecs, while the time delay is approximately 1/30 of that of previous codec.",60011520,King's College London,London,United Kingdom,"['1711', '1708']",18.555555555555557,0.08447916666666665,0.46708333333333335,1

Following data collection, the intelligence system was able to successfully differentiate the signals produced from the various facial gestures. The robotic arm was then programmed to perform a specific gesture associated with each facial gesture, based on the result produced by the intelligence system. Based on the success, additional facial gestures would be added to the intelligence system with the goal of making it more effective. With a larger database of facial gestures, the robotic arm would be able to perform more physical movements, ultimately providing a wider range of motions for users to select from.

The small number of sensors typically available on distribution circuits and consequential scarcity of field data presents a major challenge for DSSE, and it is crucial that the few sensors available are placed at optimal locations in order to maximize DSSE accuracy.

592,592,Hybrid Preconditioned CG Detection with Sequential Update for Massive MIMO Systems,"Massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) is one of the key technologies for the fifth generation communication systems. Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm approximates the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) in an iterative manner, which avoids full matrix inversion. Pre-conditioned CG (PCG) was presented to improve the robustness of CG method. However, for the PCG, a sparse matrix inversion is still required in preprocessing and the performance is only comparable to MMSE. In this paper, a hybrid PCG algorithm (HPCG) with sequential update is proposed with superior performance and low complexity. The preconditioned matrix is replaced by a diagonal matrix by exploring its characteristics, which avoids matrix inversion and incomplete Cholesky factorization. Besides, to improve the bit error performance, a sequential update strategy is employed for estimated signals after PCG detection. For a MIMO system with 128 receive antennas, simulation results show the proposed HPCG algorithm outperforms MMSE by 0.25 dB to 1.5 dB under different numbers of users. Based on the channel hardening theories, several signal vectors can be transmitted in the same channel condition. When 10 signal vectors are considered, compared to the other CG based algorithms, the overall complexity of HPCG can be reduced by 3.9% to 56%.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"['1711', '1708']",19.7,0.08409090909090908,0.5318181818181817,1

This paper investigates two modeling systems and the accuracy of error elimination and adaptation in the change of the plant/system's output. The Model Reference Adaptive Controller is a high order of adaptive control. This common fixed parameter has a proportional-integral-derivative for aircraft pitch attitude control. The Model Reference Neural Network Controller is used to the aircraft height altitude control. A disturbance in the system is introduced to test and evaluate the response performance by using the Model Reference Adaptive Controller to observe high-performance tracking in the presence of uncertainties. MATLAB System Identification Tool is used to attain the height altitude model, without disturbance, for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. System identification uses a neural network to capture the behavior of system dynamics, which assists the neural network to train itself to act as a controller.

The tools at hand focus on road design, signage, and traffic light management. These tools are coarsegrained and must manage a variable degree of compliance from human drivers. Overall, this is a very difficult task. Perhaps the biggest opportunity for the transportation system is the electronics technology revolution, which makes many powerful tools available. These include the availability of customer point-to-point information (cellphone applications), dynamic traffic management (smart lights), and directive agents (Autonomous Vehicles or Commercial Fleets). Further, with the availability of these tools, fundamentally new customer engagement models can be enabled to optimize the transportation system.

595,595,Supervised Machine Learning based Ensemble Model for Accurate Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes,"According to the American Diabetes Association(ADA), 30.3 million people in the United States have diabetes, but only 7.2 million may be undiagnosed and unaware of their condition. Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed for most patients later on in life whereas the less common Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed early on in life. People can live healthy and happy lives while living with diabetes, but early detection produces a better overall outcome on most patient's health. Thus, to test the accurate prediction of Type 2 diabetes, we use the patients' information from an electronic health records company called Practice Fusion, which has about 10,000 patient records from 2009 to 2012. This data contains individual key biometrics, including age, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, gender, height, and weight. We use this data on popular machine learning algorithms and for each algorithm, we evaluate the performance of every model based on their classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity/recall, negative predictive value, and F1 score. In our study, we find that all algorithms other than Naive Bayes suffered from very low precision. Hence, we take a step further and incorporate all the algorithms into a weighted average or soft voting ensemble model where each algorithm will count towards a majority vote towards the decision outcome of whether a patient has diabetes or not. The accuracy of the Ensemble model on Practice Fusion is 85%, by far our ensemble approach is new in this space. We firmly believe that the weighted average ensemble model not only performed well in overall metrics but also helped to recover wrong predictions and aid in accurate prediction of Type 2 diabetes. Our accurate novel model can be used as an alert for the patients to seek medical evaluation in time.",60022144,University of Central Florida,Orlando,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",26.454545454545453,0.07651515151515152,0.49151924651924656,1

Side channel attacks that target power consumption can reveal the secret key in AES implementations. Masking data with random variables is one of the main methods used to thwart power analysis attacks. Data can be masked with multiple random variables to prevent higher-order attacks at the cost of a large increase in area. A novel masking scheme for AES resistant to second-order attacks is proposed. Instead of using an additional mask, variation in finite field construction is exploited to increase resistance to second-order attacks. As a result, the area requirement is reduced.

To achieve true autonomy for UAVs in the absence of remote control, external navigation aids like global navigation satellite systems and radar systems, a minimum energy trajectory planning that considers obstacle avoidance and stability control will be the key. Although this can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem, due to the complicated non-linear relationships between UAV trajectory and thrust control, it is almost impossible to be solved analytically. While deep reinforcement learning is known for its ability to provide model free optimization for complex system through learning, its state space, actions and reward functions must be designed carefully. This paper presents our vision of different layers of autonomy in a UAV system, and our effort in generating and tracking the trajectory both using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The experimental results show that compared to conventional approaches, the learned trajectory will need 20% less control thrust and 18% less time to reach the target.

These applications often demand scalable real-time cognitive intelligence and on-the-spot decision making. Current computer systems have been customized for a cloud computing paradigm which often does not meet latency constraints and scalability requirements. To address the limitations of the cloud computing paradigm, the general trend is toward shifting the computation next to data producers at the edge. However, the edge computing paradigm is in the very early stages. Many system-level aspects of edge computing, including algorithms mapping and partitioning across edge computing resources (edge server, and edge nodes) are unknown. New research is required to understand and quantify design dimensions for edge computing.This paper presents a novel edge computing infrastructure for distributed real-time video analytics. This paper presents a holistic solution for co-designing application and edge infrastructure, including edge nodes and edge servers, to enable scalable real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Deep Learning (DL) video analytics across many cameras. For experimental results and evaluation, we focus on the case study of object re-identification across many cameras, which is composed of object detection/classification (TinyYOLOv3), feature extraction, local re-identification, and global re-identification kernels. We evaluate the edge system under three different task mapping and resource allocation configurations.

With these two methods, shift indexes vectors are created using an example of a ring code of 7 × 7, each row containing 4 units and 3 zeros. The first method makes it possible to form VPS by implementing logical transformations (XOR, OR, or AND) over the binary elements of the generating matrix of the ring code. The second method makes it possible to form VPS by implementing logical transformations (XOR, OR, or AND) over the arguments x of a certain category corresponding to the binary value of 1 code sequences of the ring code. According to the proposed second method, as a result of the logical transformations of the XOR, OR, or AND arguments of polynomials of the matrix G, similar shift indexes vectors were formed.

608,608,Learn to Imitate Using Sequence to Sequence Network with Attention,"Imitation is an important beginning step for intelligent beings to learn more complicated concepts, especially from each other. Nevertheless, imitation by it self is arguably an ability that need to be learned. In this work, we demonstrate how simple imitation behavior can be learned by using sequence to sequence network with attention. As a proof of concept, an agent is developed that is capable of taking in an English word, letter by letter, as input and generating an output sequence of letters that make up to the same word as the input. By doing so, the agent is proved to possess the ability to imitate. The input English word is first transformed through an encoder network into a set of context vectors, which may either contain semantic information of the word or some other abstract concept meaningful only to the agent. Next, the context vectors are fed to a decoder network to generates an output sequence. It is observed that an attention mechanism in the decoder network can bring improved performance and much faster convergence during training. Imitation behavior was successfully created which in turn proved the relevance of the context vectors. Perhaps more importantly, the context vectors generated can be further processed to help with more advanced tasks such as complex concept learning and reasoning. The ideas presented in this work can be used to generate other more realistic robotic imitation behaviors as well.

However, in the conventional CRO PUF design, when a path is selected by the challenge to generate a response, the circuit characteristic information constituting the CRO PUF, such as the delay information of the configurable unit, the transmission model, and etc., can also be leaked. Once the adversary monitors and masters this information, they can use this information to attack the CRO PUF circuits, such as modeling attacks. This paper establishes a theoretical model of CRO PUF and analyzes its unpredictability and security. Based on this model, a new mechanism to generate the proper challenges is proposed in this paper. In the proposed mechanism, the challenge is generated and utilized by a specific way, which can delay the feature leakage of the CRO PUF, thereby improving the security of the CRO PUF.",60029738,Queen's University Belfast,Belfast,United Kingdom,"['1711', '1708']",26.333333333333332,0.0726839826839827,0.4103354978354979,1

Many scholars have studied it on physical hosts connected over real networks and observed that NetEm could emulate most network parameters accurately. The popularity of containerization motivates us to investigate the accuracy of NetEm on virtual networks composed of containers. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of NetEm main functionality on the containers run on Docker, a well-recognized solution for containerization, and compare the results with NetEm performance on a real network connecting physical hosts. We found that NetEm provides the same level of accuracy and stability for packet loss on these two platforms. The TCP throughput under emulated loss and latency was found to be very close when measured on containers and hosts under all circumstances except the scenarios where there is no additional delay combined with packet loss greater than 2%. NetEm offers more accurate delay emulation on physical hosts. On containers, we have observed small additional delay and occasional spikes that can be attributed to time-sharing of CPU in the containerized system. While these must be taken into account when performing a protocol performance study, they are not significant and, therefore, we can conclude that containers coupled with NetEm can be considered a reliable tool for the study of network protocol performance.",60027576,University of New Hampshire Durham,Durham,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",25.22222222222222,0.20679824561403512,0.3712406015037594,1

614,614,A Secure and Robust Key Generation Method Using Physical Unclonable Functions and Polar Codes,"In physical unclonable functions (PUFs) based key generation methods, the bias of PUF outputs would leak secrecy. A secure and robust key generation method based on PUFs and polar codes is proposed in this paper. First, a PUF-based key generation process is modeled as a wiretap channel. Then, two secure polar coding schemes are designed for the wiretap channel to improve the robustness of key generation and to reduce the secrecy leakage caused by the bias of PUF outputs. To construct the secure polar coding schemes, density evolution is used to evaluate the error probability of synthesized channels, which in turn is used to approximate both the error probability and the secrecy leakage of the system. To reduce the polar construction complexity, the channel independent polar construction method aids density evolution to select parameters of the secure polar coding schemes. Finally, we compare the key generation design with other works and find that our key generation scheme requires fewer PUF bits than other works when they generate the same length key with failure probability \le 10{-6}.",60000060,Lehigh University,Bethlehem,United States,"['1711', '1708']",25.142857142857142,0.014743589743589736,0.549084249084249,1
615,615,A Hybrid GPU + FPGA System Design for Autonomous Driving Cars,"Autonomous driving cars need highly complex hardware and software systems, which require high performance computing platforms in order to enable a real time AI-based perception and decision making pipeline. The industry has been exploring various in-vehicle accelerators such as GPUs, ASICs and FPGAs. Yet the autonomous driving platform design is far from mature when taking into account of system reliability, redundancy and higher level of autonomy. In this work, we propose a hybrid computing system design, which integrates a GPU as the primary computing system and a FPGA as a secondary system. This hybrid system architecture has multiple advantages: 1) The FPGA can be constantly running as a complementary system with very short latency, helping to detect main system failure and anomalous behavior, contributing to system functionality verification and reliability. 2) If the primary system fails (mostly from sensor or interconnection error), the FPGA will quickly detect the failure and run a safe-mode task with a subset of sensors. 3) The FPGA can be used as an independent computing system to run extra algorithm components to improve the overall system autonomy. For example, FPGA can handle driver monitoring tasks while GPU focuses on driving functions. Together they can boost the driving function from L2 (constantly requires driver's attention) to L3 (allows driver to mind off for 10 seconds). This paper defines how such a system works, discusses various use cases and potential design challenges, and shares some initial results and insights about how to make such a system deliver the maximum value for autonomous driving.",60000745,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Urbana,United States,"['1711', '1708']",25.5,0.06489583333333333,0.41421874999999997,1

WPT is a tree algorithm, which is an expansion of wavelet transform (WT). WPT offers the advantage of selecting the best tree from a number of bases in order to provide a better signal representation by preserving integrity and removing redundancy to achieve higher compression with minimal degradation in signal fidelity. For the selection of the best tree from the full tree of WPT, Shannon entropy is employed to get an exact representation of the signal. The compression is achieved by the use of the threshold on the best tree coefficients, and finally the signal reconstruction by the use of the thresholded coefficients. The presented method, which is assessed using different EEG signals, achieves good compression ratios (CR) with minimum distortion.",60009804,Tuskegee University,Tuskegee,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",23.166666666666668,0.42083333333333334,0.4583333333333333,1

A CSP library was developed to provide the necessary functionality for implementing CSP-based concurrent applications on top of MPI. The library enables seamless communication between processes on the same node and processes across different nodes. A new configuration language was implemented to provide a straightforward way to map processes onto cluster nodes. This was designed in such a way to allow for mapping the same application using different mapping algorithms without having to recompile the application.

To efficiently convert wave energy into electricity, the prediction of wave excitation forces to keep the generator and the wave excitation force in sync is important for maximum energy extraction. The study shows a prediction methodology of half period and zero crossings in the practical scenario of irregular ocean waves. The prediction has been tested for different wave periods and with different filter orders. The prediction results have been used in the PTOS simulation to analyze the energy extraction. It has been shown that the prediction accuracy in the wave half period between the truth data and the predicted data drives the WEC energy extraction efficiency. The amplitude of the wave force is not used and hence the prediction deviation in the wave force amplitude does not affect the PTOS energy extraction.

624,624,Application of Machine Learning Algorithms for Crack Detection in PVC Pipes,"Most of the underground sewer infrastructure in United States uses Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) pipes to transport toxic fluids. Cracks in underground PVC pipes are a major cause of effluent discharge in underground sewer systems. Released effluents not only pose risk to the environment, but are also a threat to public health. As current industry standard, utility operators use a closed circuit Television (CCTV) camera mounted crawler to pass through the pipes, and record video to classify condition of the piping network. CCTV based systems are expensive and crew-hour intensive. Recently developed acoustic based pipeline inspection systems are being adopted by the utility operators. These systems, however, do not detect presence of cracks in pipes. This paper reports results of a study to monitor presence of cracks in PVC pipes using acoustic signals. The collected data from extensive laboratory trials is processed using machine learning algorithms to classify the difference between a clean and cracked pipe samples. We use Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Naïve Bayes (NB) algorithms.

Initially, a hydrogen fuel cell was constructed using a series of razor blades, wires, and an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide. Since the fuel cell failed in delivering power to electronic devices, a four parallel stacks of six NiMH AA rechargeable batteries in series were substituted to deliver roughly 8 V to an Arduino Uno, which powered a DROK integrated circuit in order to provide charge to small electronics, such as cell phones. A 50 W solar panel was used to charge these batteries. To maximize the efficiency of this solar panel, a mount was designed and built using a servo motor and CdS photo resistors that was capable of orienting the photovoltaic cell to the strongest source of light. A program for the Arduino Uno was composed to control this mount to provide power to the DROK integrated circuit, and read the battery stack's relative state of charge and illuminate LEDs accordingly. A switch was incorporated into the design that would cut power to the microcontroller when the prototype was not being used. After constructing the prototype, multiple tests were run both on subassemblies and on the overall device to verify its electrical capabilities, mechanical stability, and aesthetic appeal to a broader audience.

632,632,Using Exponential and Logarithmic Thresholds to Optimize Scalable Video Traffic over Passive Optical Networks,"Demand for internet services is rising quickly with the recent growing influx of internet-connected devices. Networks are continually being optimized or upgraded to accommodate this traffic with Passive Optical Networks (PONs) being a popular choice for replacing dated infrastructure due to their high performance to cost ratio. However, video traffic makes up an increasingly large portion of global IP traffic causing optimization to be difficult. This difficulty stems from the high coefficient of variability of compressed video traffic and is then compounded by the growing use of PONs which commonly employ a star topology thereby mandating the use of a centralized MAC protocol. Video traffic over PONs can be optimized by changing a video stream's bit-rate during transmission thus adapting to the bandwidth available to a PON at any point in time. This is accomplished by dropping a variable number of Medium Grain Scalable (MGS) H.264 AVC video enhancement layers. In this work two novel packet dropping schemes are proposed, one employing a logarithmic dropping threshold and the other employing an exponential dropping threshold. It is shown that though the performance improvements gained from dropping all of the scalable video layers is small, the most efficient way to do so is through employing the logarithmic threshold dropping scheme which achieved a 146.9% improvement over the base layer for video delay jitter easily outperforming the 89.8% and 44.5% improvement for linear and exponential dropping respectively. The benefits of logarithmic dropping over linear and exponential dropping are reinforced in the data queueing delay and video queueing delay performance metrics.",60020059,Georgia Southern University,Statesboro,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",28.555555555555557,0.050052910052910064,0.5078835978835978,1

Currently, many scientific organizations are conducting research on the creation of such automated control systems that would allow them to be restructured as widely as possible and as quickly as possible, while ensuring an acceptable level of complexity (dimension) of management tasks. IPRI also conducts such studies. At the same time, as a working toolkit, a special design environment is used. It called the modeling complex of the control system. Using this toolkit, it is convenient to develop modern automated systems of organizational management within the framework of the established management concept. A change of concept makes you change the original design. The difficulty of making changes is great enough, which slows down the system to practical implementation. The authors investigated the possibilities and suggested areas of scientific research on the development of the theory of designing organizational management systems that would be adapted to rapid conceptual changes in automated forms of activity.

This work illustrates how a process-oriented model written in C++CSP can hide the underlying primitives from the programmer to allow M:N style thread support. The objective is to provide integrated kernel-level and user-level thread support in C++CSP without major changes to the process interface. To illustrate that kernel-level and user-level threads are working together two experiments have been undertaken. The first executes a stressed select to determine the cost of process-count scaling. The second experiment executes a scaling number of processes syncing across hardware to illustrate the sync-time cost as the number of user-level threads increases in each context. The results illustrate that it is possible to build M:N style thread support transparently for process design, and that doing so provides a significant increase in the number of active processes in library supported CSP while still taking advantage of multicore hardware.",60018186,Edinburgh Napier University,Edinburgh,United Kingdom,['1700'],24.0,0.06927083333333334,0.4260416666666667,0

The MRF is a smart fluid that changes from a liquid state into a semi-solid state within milliseconds when a magnetic field is applied. The change from liquid state to semisolid state demonstrated in this study is achieved by varying the distance between two magnets and hence the magnetic field. The experimental results show that the frequency of the vibrational system was increased by 16% when the MRF was activated at 0. 1T. The damping was also increased by 48.8% when a magnetic field of 0. 3T was added to MRF. The change in damping also affected the stiffness of the piezoelectric cantilever beam and hence the power generated from the piezoelectric bimorph cantilever. The generated power from the cantilever without MRF damping was calculated to be 1.1 \muW at a resistance of 330 k\Omega but increased to 9 \muW when the damping of 0. 1T was applied.,60042282,Kaunas University of Technology,Kaunas,Lithuania,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",16.5,0.10476190476190476,0.38095238095238093,1

640,640,Collection and Analysis of Digital Forensic Data from Devices in the Internet of Things,"Despite the abundance of articles that have been written about the Internet of Things (IoT), little attention has been given to how digital forensic approaches can be utilized to direct advanced investigations in IoT-based frameworks. Current digital forensic tools and functions are not generally prepared to tackle the complexity of IoT frameworks for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and testing potential evidence from IoT environments that might be utilized as permissible evidence in a courtroom. Hence, the issue to be addressed is that; currently, there is no generally-accepted digital forensic framework that can be used to conduct digital forensic investigations in IoT-based environments. In addition, at the time of this writing, there has been little focus on how to gather and save network and server logs from IoT-based environments for investigative purposes.

The motivation for this paper comes from the OpenPLC project [1], and the development of a PLC testbed which can be used for cybersecurity research [2]. Depending on the economics of the problem, having dedicated and protected communication channels may not be economically feasible, especially for microgrid systems. In other words, the economics of the application may dictate the use of common and unprotected communication channels, like the Internet for higher level coordination. This means that the embedded system responsible for time-sensitive tasks, like power management, energy management, voltage regulation, or reactive power sharing, must also have some awareness of potential cyber threats. In particular, its state transition diagram, timeout values for blocking I/O operations, whether it will be bare-metal or not, and where the TCP/IP stack will run, are all very critical design issues.

However, the huge computations form the bottleneck and limit its practical applications. The modular multiplication operation, which is one of the most computationally demanding operations in the fundamental arithmetics, takes up a large part of the computations in the protocol.

However, this saliency results in initial access and handover challenges. Namely, narrow beam transmission is vulnerable to link blockage, user mobility, sparse received power profile, increased latencies and power consumption. Hence, this paper presents a novel handover scheme that utilizes primary and redundant beams transmission at the mobile station. Here, the redundant beam is used in different modes based upon link state. Foremost, once blockage is introduced to the primary beam, then an instantaneous self-handover procedure is performed by the redundant beam to a new base station. This maintains communication sessions without the requirement for repeated beam search. Meanwhile, the redundant beam is aggregated with the primary beam for enhanced spectral efficiencies in the absence of blockage effects. The scheme deploys hybrid and digital beamforming architectures at the mobile station (MS) and base station (BS), respectively, i.e., using uninform circular arrays. The proposed scheme yields enhanced spectral efficiencies, high received power profiles, and near-instantaneous recovery times, as compared to conventional recovery schemes.",60030736,King Faisal University,Al-Ahsa,Saudi Arabia,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",18.0,-0.09257860560492139,0.38166780587833216,1

A Systolic Array (SA) is often considered as one of the most favorable architecture to achieve high performance for matrix multiplication. In this paper, the design exploration for an approximate SA is pursued; three design schemes are proposed by introducing approximation in multiple sub-modules. An approximation factor \alpha is introduced; it is related to the inexact columns in the SA to explore the accuracy-efficiency trade-off present in the proposed designs. In the evaluation, an 8-bit input operand matrix multiplication is considered; the Synopsys Design Compiler at 45nm technology node is used to establish hardware-related metrics. The Error Rate (ER), Normalized Mean Error Distance (NMED) and Mean Relative Error Distance (MRED) are used as figures of merit for error analysis. Results show that the proposed architecture for 8-bit matrix multiplication with an approximation factor \alpha=7 has the lower power consumption compared to existing inexact designs found in the technical literature with comparable NMED. In addition, a power delay product vs NMED analysis shows the proposed designs have a lower PDP so applicable to low power applications.

The main threats to security systems of critical information resources are analyzed. Mathematical model of counteraction of internal and external threats to the system of protection of critical information resources of mineral fertilizers production is developed. The process of building a mathematical model of countering the threats in the system of protection of critical information resources with the help of Markov chain. The methodology of finding current threats to data security during their processing is offered. The software module is developed in the Piton programming language. These examples calculate the probability of mathematical model of information system in one of four states (the threat did not come; the threat came but was not implemented; the threat has been implemented; the threat came, but it was reflected protection system). Examples of numerical results analysis using proposed techniques clearly show that their use helps to define threats that are relevant to the system being investigated and can be used in practice. The disadvantage of proposed methodology is the need to consider the system behaviour when it comes to each type of threat, individually and inability to define behaviour on the simultaneous action of several threats. Studying the influence of each threat separately allows to study each of its types in more detail and to determine the probability of which is the greatest occurrence.

While various automatic whole heart and great vessel segmentation frameworks have been developed in the literature, they are ineffective when applied to medical images in CHD, which have significant variations in heart structure and great vessel connections. To address the challenge, we leverage the power of deep learning in processing regular structures and that of graph algorithms in dealing with large variations, and propose a framework that combines both for whole heart and great vessel segmentation in CHD. Particularly, we first use deep learning to segment the four chambers and myocardium followed by blood pool, where variations are usually small. We then extract the connection information and apply graph matching to determine the categories of all the vessels. Experimental results using 68 3D CT images covering 14 types of CHD show that our method can increase Dice score by 11.9% on average compared with the state-of-The-Art whole heart and great vessel segmentation method in normal anatomy.

Unfortunately, conventional angle-of-Arrival (AoA) estimation methods, such as MUSIC and ESPRIT algorithms, need a lot of calculations and must solve the issue of phase ambiguity. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel AoA estimation method based on layered ensemble learning. Because the training process can be completed off-line, only estimating complexity is taken into account which make the AoA detection process low complexity and meet real-Time requirements. The simulation results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed AOA estimation method is higher than that of traditional algorithms.

660,660,Design and Implementation of a Neural Network Based Predistorter for Enhanced Mobile Broadband,"Digital predistortion is the process of using digital signal processing to correct nonlinearities caused by the analog RF front-end of a wireless transmitter. These nonlinearities contribute to adjacent channel leakage, degrade the error vector magnitude of transmitted signals, and often force the transmitter to reduce its transmission power into a more linear but less power-efficient region of the device. Most predistortion techniques are based on polynomial models with an indirect learning architecture which have been shown to be overly sensitive to noise. In this work, we use neural network based predistortion with a novel neural network training method that avoids the indirect learning architecture and that shows significant improvements in both the adjacent channel leakage ratio and error vector magnitude. Moreover, we show that, by using a neural network based predistorter, we are able to achieve a 42% reduction in latency and 9.6% increase in throughput on an FPGA accelerator with 15% fewer multiplications per sample when compared to a similarly performing memory-polynomial implementation.",60032882,Technische Universiteit Eindhoven,Eindhoven,Netherlands,"['1711', '1708']",32.8,0.20092592592592592,0.42962962962962964,1
661,661,Methodology to Identify Real-time Transmission Line Re-Closing Problem for Generator Protection,"A transmission element, including a transmission line or an autotransformer, reclosure will cause electrical power transients on the Bulk Electric System. These switching transients can cause a sudden change in electrical power output on nearby generators. The magnitude of the sudden change in power is directly related to the phase angle difference across the breaker poles when opened. The larger the angle difference across the breaker the larger the sudden change in power on the generator. If these sudden changes in power are of a large enough magnitude, permanent damage can be caused to the shaft of the generator. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology for computing near real-time sudden power changes. This will aid decision makers in identifying potential closing angle issues and giving transmission operators the opportunity to expeditiously mitigate the problem before the transmission element is switched back into service. Furthermore, the methodology is demonstrated via planning and operational examples.

666,666,MUMMERING Platform Idea's & ubiquitous data analysis," All rights reserved.The growth from terabytes of 3D imaging data and soon approaching petabytes from material analysis has left the scientists involved with a set of challenges. In particular, the ability to efficiently analyze an ever growing collection of material tomography scans. The MUMMERING research project aims to solve this by providing ability to submit workflows to automate the process of analyzing the collected data. We explore and present our initial design thoughts in this endeavor. This includes a proposal to utilize the IDMC system developed at UCPH to provide an efficient method in terms of scheduling and execution of workflows. Beyond this mere exploration of thoughts about a potential solution for the MUMMERING project, this paper will also we introduce our initial work in providing ubiquitous access to the produced datasets. The aim here is to provide a simple API for loading/storing datasets during an image analysis, by providing this universal data access library (i,e. mig utils). With this we hope to help the non computer scientists involved in defining imaging analysis programs that easily either can executed locally during the experimentation phase or subsequently scheduled by a workflow scheduler.",60017041,Niels Bohr Institute,Copenhagen,Denmark,['1700'],21.333333333333332,0.014285714285714287,0.24098639455782314,0
668,668,Adaptive Strategies of Multi-Objective Optimization for Greener Networks,"Increasing energy costs and environmental issues related to the Internet and wired networks continue to be a major concern. Energy-efficient or power-aware networks continue to gain interest in the research community. Existing energy reduction approaches do not fully address all aspects of the problem. We consider the problem of reducing energy by turning off network links, while achieving acceptable load balance, by adjusting link weights. In this research, we optimize two objectives, which are minimizing network energy consumption by maximizing utilization of shortest paths, and at the same time achieving load-balance by minimizing network Maximum Link Utilization (MLU). Increasing utilization of shortest paths provides the opportunity to switch off nodes and links, thus saving network power. This research proposes a new approach that relies on live data collected from wired networks, and performs Multi Objective Optimization (MOO) using a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) that applies alternative adaptive strategies in order to optimize both objectives. Research to date has focused on the link level or traffic load balance, to minimize energy consumption, while putting less focus on utilizing adaptive strategic techniques that optimize multi objectives problems. This work proposes a novel approach to select underutilized links to go to sleep using adaptive strategies of MOO that are aware of traffic changes. Re-computing the algorithm should take less than a minute, while network traffic is frequently updated every few minutes. The hybrid approach we proposed was able to reduce the power consumption by 35%, while reducing MLU by 31% for specific traffic pattern used in Abilene network topology.",60019600,Nova Southeastern University,Fort Lauderdale,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",23.363636363636363,0.050145687645687644,0.2779137529137529,1
669,669,Adverse Impacts of 5G Downlinks on Human Body,"The increasing demand for higher data rates and uninterrupted reliable service have made the frequency spectrum above 6 GHz a very promising candidate for future wireless communications because of its massive amount of raw bandwidth and extremely high data transfer capabilities. However, increasing concerns of communications at high frequencies on human health have gained international alarm that suggests more research before it is deployed successfully. In this context, this paper aims to investigate the human electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure from fifth-generation (5G) downlink communications and compare its impacts with the present cellular technologies considering the features that the 5G systems will likely adopt. Our simulation results suggest that while the impacts from 5G beamforming communications cross the regulatory borders at downlinks for a very short range between base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UE), the exposure level remains on a high throughout the entire network compared to the present systems. Also, this paper urges for more research on the exposure level from future communications to determine any possible threats below the existing guidelines. This paper also highlights the significance of considering SAR for the measurement of exposure compliance in downlinks.",60020059,Georgia Southern University,Statesboro,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",31.666666666666668,0.06836923076923077,0.4298615384615384,1

The results show that, compared with outcomes in no-delegation case, equilibrium outputs are higher but platform profits are lower under delegation case. Furthermore, the model is extended by adding a stage before the contract designing stage, where platform owners need to make decision about whether to hire a manager or not. The analysis shows that, when the strength of the indirect network externalities is relatively weak, both owners decide to hire managers (or not) if the fixed cost to hire managers is small (or large). However, in the presence of relatively strong indirect network externalities, asymmetric delegation appears as equilibrium in some case.",60005244,"Southeast University, Nanjing",Nanjing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",24.2,0.062103174603174584,0.48115079365079366,1
671,671,Schematron-based Semantic Constraints Specification Framework and Validation Rules Engine for JSON,"Business data is a critical asset for organizations. Data quality issues can creep in at multiple stages during the creation and processing of the business data. Syntax and semantic validation of business data at inception and during processing are of utmost importance to mitigate financial and other types of risks. Currently, XML is a predominant format for business data. XML has a mature syntax and semantic constraint specification standards and validation toolset. JSON is an emerging format for business data. It has a relatively mature syntax specification standard and a variety of validation tools but it lacks a common semantic/co-constraints specification standard and reusable validation toolset. This research developed a system to overcome these serious limitations. The system consists of a) an ISO/IEC 19757- 3 Schematron compliant framework to specify the semantic constraints in JSON itself and b) a JavaScript-based reusable and extensible validation component. The semantic constraints specification framework can be leveraged to specify arbitrarily complex constraints whereas the validation tool can be used as a standalone component or can be embedded in other data processing enterprise systems as a module. Together this system can be used as a test bed for further research in the area of semantic validation for JSON data.

The study also benefits software developers and programmers striving to improve code efficiency and speed up development process. With source code analysis, the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) which is very useful in NLP, becomes severely limited by its inability to handle the semantic and syntactic properties of source codes. Therefore, we processed the source code datasets as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) rather than the source code text itself to take advantage of the information-rich structure of the AST.

As the outcome of most clustering algorithms is heavily dependent on the initial cluster centers, it is necessary to consider optimization during the process of segmentation. The Multi-Objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) was used for optimization in this study, to find optimal cluster centers. It is important to note that the effectiveness of MOEA is dependent upon the selection of objective functions. Two objectives were considered; namely, the minimization of intra-cluster compactness and the maximization of inter-cluster separation to determine the optimal initial cluster centers. XieBeni index (XBI) was used to measure the compactness and separation of cluster centers while the Average Inter-Cluster Separation (AIS) measure ensures the minimal overlapping of clusters. The MOEA will generate a set of non-dominated solutions. The Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) is then employed to determine the most optimal solution for the cluster centers.

693,693,Building formal model of the internet routing for risk evaluation of cyberattacks on global routing," Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).One of the most significant problems deriving from the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) weaknesses is route leaks and route hijacks. Estimating the risks of route interception requires quantitative measurement of the impact of an attack on the routing distortion, and therefore, the loss of information security breach. This offers a way of exploring the topology of connections between autonomous Internet systems to further formulate the risk management task as a topology problem. One of the most important steps in modeling the impact of routing attacks is to build a formal model of global Internet routing. In this paper we offer to provide formal description for objects, relations and processes of the Internet routing. Firstly we postulate the Internet as a set of IP addresses, grouped to address prefixes in routing tables. Prefixes are announced by autonomous systems with BGP protocol. Prefixes are aggregated and incapsulated one to another using subnet mask and this affects the accessibility of IP addresses in prefix. The set of routes to each prefix can be represented as directional graph, and combination of all that graphs built as routes to all announced prefixes can be used as representation of the Internet at global routing level. We provide a formal description of global routing objects and their relationships, as well as the process of route selection. All formulations are equally applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6 types of prefixes. Therefore, a formal description of the two components of the routing process is provided: the calculation of the IP prefix and path selection. These steps are an important in formulating the route hijack risk management problem as a task for researching effective link topology.",60011313,National Academy of Sciences in Ukraine,Kiev,Ukraine,['1700'],22.153846153846153,0.2602941176470588,0.47990196078431374,0

695,695,A Low-Latency and Low-Complexity Hardware Architecture for CTC Beam Search Decoding,"The recurrent neural networks (RNNs) along with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) have been widely used in many sequence to sequence tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), lipreading, and scene text recognition (STR). In these systems, CTC-Trained RNNs usually require specific CTC-decoders after their output layers. Many existing CTC-Trained RNN inference systems use FPGA to do calculations of RNNs, and decode their outputs on CPU. However, with the development of FPGA-based RNN hardware accelerators, existing CPU-based CTC-decoder can not meet the latency requirement of them. To resolve this issue, this paper proposes an efficient hardware architecture for the CTC beam search decoder based on the decoding method reported in our previous work. The experimental results show that the system latency per sample of the CTC-decoder is only 7.19us on Xilinx xc7vx1140tflg19301 FPGA platform, which is lower than state-of-The-Art RNNs. We also implement the origin algorithm on the same FPGA platform. Comparison results show that the improved one reduces the system latency per sample by 63.67%, the LUTRAMs by 97.44%, the FFs by 79.55%, and the DSPs by 50%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on hardware implementation for CTC beam search decoder.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"['1711', '1708']",21.77777777777778,0.16666666666666669,0.3727272727272727,1
696,696,"Event-driven, collaborative and adaptive scientific workflows on the grid"," All rights reserved.Exponential growth in scientific data set sizes and corresponding computation needs, forces scientists and engineers to structure and automate experiments in workflows running on distributed architectures. In eScience the flows typically evolve gradually from intensive experimentation and often involve multiple participants from separate organisations. Thus, there's a need for infrastructures supporting such highly dynamic and collaborative workflows. Despite much attention to scientific workflows in recent years, most existing systems tend to be single-user top-down approaches, which are inherently best suited for static and fixed flows with all steps known up front. In this work we introduce a simple general rule-based model for event-driven workflows based on data change triggers. A bottom-up workflow approach, that enables a high level of automation and allows dynamically changing flows - with or without manual user interaction. It is realised with an implementation on top of the Minimum intrusion Grid (MiG), which helps de-couple workflow design from underlying execution concerns, and provides built-in collaboration and sharing across organisation boundaries. However, the model itself applies to much wider range of scenarios, and other such possible implementation methods are briefly outlined.",60017041,Niels Bohr Institute,Copenhagen,Denmark,['1700'],23.375,0.15841666666666668,0.4036071428571429,0

A unique averaging constraint will maintain battery charge capacity at the end of a dispatching cycle with the use of a novel algorithm. Both, battery sizing equation and averaging-constraint algorithm are included in a computer model for validation.

705,705,Pico-Grid Smart Home Energy Management System Using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients,"Residences consume a significant amount of electrical power. Unfortunately, some of it goes to waste as homeowners often unintentionally consume excessive amounts of power. Home energy management systems aid homeowners in their power consumption decisions by measuring their power consumption and presenting that information in a user-friendly format. In this paper, we propose the enhancement of the Pico-Grid Smart Home Energy Management System by using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients. It is a consumer-grade energy management system capable of identifying loads by analyzing current draw and is distinguished from other home energy management systems by its incorporation of a novel hardware design created to ensure reliable sampling and a classifier consisting of several artificial neural networks (ANN). Each neural network corresponds to a classified device which allows the system to be trained to recognize additional devices without having to re-train the entire existing network. The classifier converts the current signal to the Mel-spaced Cepstrum domain in order to extract relevant features achieving an overall classification accuracy of 97.8% with average positive and negative predictive values of 93.2% and 98.7% respectively. This enables the system to potentially have a lower cost but higher accuracy than other similar designs that have been suggested thus far. This system aids homeowners in making energy-conscious decisions such as monitoring the energy costs of their home appliances and scheduling heavy loads during periods of low demand.",60020059,Georgia Southern University,Statesboro,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",25.444444444444443,-0.026286213786213788,0.5245504495504496,1
706,706,A Survey of Computation-Driven Data Encoding,"Although the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) has been the dominant device for modern very-large scale integration (VLSI) circuits for more than six decades, with the dawning of a post-Moore era, researchers are trying to find replacements. A foundation of modern digital computing is the encoding of digital values through a binary radix representation. However, as we enter into the post-Moore era, the challenges of increasing power density, signal noise, and device unreliability raise the question of whether this basic way of encoding data is still the best choice, particularly with novel electronic devices. Prior work has shown that binary radix encoding has some disadvantages. We argue that it is crucial to rethink the necessity of using this representation in the post-Moore era. In this paper, we review some recent development on computation-driven data encoding. We begin with stochastic encoding, a representation proposed a long time ago, discussing both its advantages and disadvantages. Then, we review several recent breakthroughs with variations of stochastic encoding that mitigate many of its disadvantages. Finally, we conclude the paper by extrapolating future directions for effective computation-driven data encoding.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1711', '1708']",20.333333333333332,0.17314814814814816,0.3435185185185185,1
707,707,Distributed Combined Emission-Economic Dispatch via Coalitional Integration of Wind Turbines,"Intermittent and fluctuating renewable energy sources are increasingly becoming integral parts of modern electric power grids. The increasing reliance on renewable energy resources and usage of large-scale distributed generators to replace existing traditional turbines are motivated by the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the environment and the nation's energy dependency to address the shortage of fossil fuels. However, the intermittent nature of wind energy resources tends to make stability problems more challenging with the continuous mismatch between supply and demand. These challenges have engendered a necessity for the development of effective strategies/algorithms that can enable the resilient operation of power systems. This paper utilizes the concept of cooperative game theory (i.e., Shapley Value) to develop a new strategy for incorporating wind energy cost and transmission line loss in combined emission economic dispatch. The main goals are to integrate distributed wind sources while efficiently trading power, sensibly reduce the use of traditional sources, optimal dispatch generators, and increase spinning reserves to allow more flexible management of system stability issues. The optimization problem is solved hourly for different scenarios of wind energy, demand and traditional sources with three wind farms while maintaining system generation constraints, voltage constraints, area reserve, and ramp rate constraints. The Shapley-value-based algorithm is used for fair distribution of the utility among the coalition members. The proposed model is successfully validated using the IEEE 39 bus system. The developed algorithm is able to accommodate variable wind, and reduce the total cost and real power losses of the system.",60009804,Tuskegee University,Tuskegee,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",25.1,0.25515151515151513,0.6006439393939395,1

709,709,Comparison of Peak Demand Shaving Potential of Demand Response and Distributed Energy Storage in Residential Buildings,"Due to a growing power demand and cyclic energy consumption patterns, thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) in residential buildings have become major candidates for residential demand response (DR) programs. However, in recent times, there has been an increased interest in the usage of distributed energy storage, such as batteries, for grid support and energy management applications including peak shaving and frequency regulation, which overlaps with typical objectives of TCL-centric residential DR programs. In this paper, we present a comparison between peak shaving using TCLs and distributed battery energy storage. A detailed model of 100 residential homes, developed using GridLAB-D, is used to simulate demand response strategies for the TCLs as well as battery charging and discharging algorithms to achieve peak load reduction while maintaining predefined customer comfort levels. Different customer enrolment scenarios are also considered for more realistic results. An economic analysis of both solutions is also presented. The results obtained show that while TCLs alone may not be able to realistically eliminate the most expensive peaking plants, they can still provide cheaper peak load reductions when compared with distributed battery energy storage units, with the reductions increasing as more customers are enrolled.",60006951,The University of North Carolina at Charlotte,Charlotte,United States,"['1705', '1712', '1711']",27.428571428571427,0.13359375,0.44583333333333336,1

Nevertheless, in a cloud pay-per-use model, the number of demanded resources must be taken into account in order to minimise the costs. Our main goal is to reason about a cloud-aware application's resource usage by means of our Timed Process Algebra called BTC (Bounded True Concurrency), that is, to study the trade-offs between an application's response time and resource usage. Video encoders are software applications that need a lot of resources and work on files of considerable size. Therefore, it seems reasonable to try to take advantage of the capacity offered by cloud computing to accelerate the coding process. The H.264 standard is a wide-spread encoding solution, although other standards are being developed and tested to be the former's successors, such as H.265 or HEVC. In this paper, the video encoder H.265 will be adapted following the Map/Reduce paradigm in order to be able to be executed in Hadoop. Then, its algebraic formalization will be developed by BTC and validated on a real private cloud environment.
