4,4,When and How to Leverage E-commerce Cart Targeting: The relative and moderated effects of scarcity and price incentives with a two-stage field experiment and causal forest optimization," However, practitioners might target shoppers who have short-listed products in their digital carts without fully considering how ECT designs interact with consumer mindsets in online shopping stages. This paper develops a conceptual model of ECT that addresses the question of when (with versus without carts) and how to target (scarcity versus price promotion). Our ECT model is grounded in the consumer goal stage theory of deliberative or implemental mindsets and supported by a two-stage field experiment involving more than 22,000 mobile users. The results indicate that ECT has a substantial impact on consumer purchases, inducing a 29.9% higher purchase rate than e-commerce targeting without carts. Moreover, this incremental impact is moderated: the ECT design with a price incentive amplifies the impact, but the same price incentive leads to ineffective e-commerce targeting without carts. By contrast, a scarcity message attenuates the impact but significantly boosts purchase responses to targeting without carts. Interestingly, the costless scarcity nudge is approximately 2.3 times more effective than the costly price incentive in the early shopping stage without carts, whereas a price incentive is 11.4 times more effective than the scarcity message in the late stage with carts. We also leverage a causal forest algorithm that can learn purchase response heterogeneity to develop a practical scheme of optimizing ECT. Our model and findings empower managers to prudently target consumer shopping interests embedded in digital carts to capitalize on new opportunities in e-commerce.",60122660,Fox School of Business,Philadelphia,United States,"['1710', '1705']",26.333333333333332,0.22409090909090912,0.4703030303030303,0
5,5,Digital trance: Neo-shamanism in the Russian Internet,"The paper deals with representation of neo-shamanism in today’s media. The topicality of the study is justified by transformation of neo-shamanic practices in the context of digital culture, which is manifested, among other things, in resorting to opportunities offered by the new media in marketing one’s services. The study material were web sites in the Russian Internet and web pages in Russian social networks related to shamanism. The goal of the study is to reveal how neo-shamanism is shaped and structured in the Internet. For our analysis of the content of the web pages we relied on structural and semiotic methods, statistical methods were drawn upon for the study of Internet communities’ audience. There are several types of neo-shaman web sites: pages of shaman centres and religious ogranisations; personal web pagers of neo-shamans; web sites about magic and para-psychology. The standard format of Internet marketing and usability requirements gives rise to unification of neo-shamanism representations through structuring them by sample entries whose content is eclectic but easily identifiable by users. Analysis of the statistics of neo-shaman pages in the Russian Internet and in the social network “Vkontakte” has shown that users of 25 – 45 y/o have more interest in shamanism and neo-shamans’ services, regardless of sex difference. The content of neo-shaman web pages comprises texts, images and sound. Text messages deal with instructing users in shamanism, promoting neo-shamans’ services and offering motivators in the form of citations. The latter occupy a prominent place in news feeds. The visual content includes images on the subject of shamanism, psychedelic paintings and visionary art. The style of the visual content we define as a synthesis of ethnographic, environmental and psychedelic elements. The sound content of the web sites contains music reflecting ethnic shamanic traditions (Siberia, Northen Europe, the Americas), neofolk and ritual ambient. The resulting conclusion of the study is that surfing neo-shaman web sites and pages in social networks is in itself a “lightweight”, postmodern version of shamanic trance with its virtual symbols: motivating spells, psychedelic images and meditative ritual music.",60104963,Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University,Novosibirsk,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.666666666666668,0.10978787878787878,0.2805151515151515,1

This is based on the reliability and availability of a communications infrastructure network from a service provider company. The infrastructure can be in the form of a series or topology of devices that support the operation of services, these devices can be physical or virtual. Network infrastructure requires a routing protocol to improve the optimization of data communication on data traffic. For the distribution of broadcast domains on network infrastructure, Inter-VLAN can be used to reduce hardware usage and make cost savings. For data packet filtering activities, ACL can be used so that unknown data packets cannot be through the internal network. This research conducted at Bandung District Government is expected to improve the optimization of network infrastructure conditions using Inter-VLAN with the Network Development Life Cycle method. With inter-VLAN, 1 broadcast domain on infrastructure at Bandung District Government can be divided into several broadcast domains and each SKPD also can communicate with another.

8,8,Software patents and firm value: A real options perspective on the role of innovation orientation and environmental uncertainty," Drawing on the real options theory and the literature on exploration and exploitation, we develop a novel theoretical framework to assess the value of software patents. Moreover, we examine the impact of contextual factors related to the nature of innovation underlying firms’ patent portfolios (exploitative versus explorative) and the environmental uncertainty (competitiveness and dynamism) on the value of software patents. Specifically, we examine the interaction effect of a firm’s software patent stock and its innovation orientation on firm value in markets exhibiting different levels of environmental uncertainty. Based on a large-panel data set consisting of 602 U.S. firms, our results indicate that a software patent portfolio having higher levels of explorative orientation is associated with a higher firm value (as measured by Tobin’s q) in environments exhibiting low dynamism and high competitiveness. By contrast, a software patent portfolio with higher levels of exploitative orientation is associated with a higher firm value in environments with high dynamism and low competitiveness.

10,10,Optimal management of virtual infrastructures under flexible cloud service agreements," The agreement also lays out the price charged to the client and a penalty to the provider when the assured availability is not met. The availability assurance involves backup resource provisioning, and the provider needs to allocate backups cost-effectively by balancing the resource-provisioning costs with the potential penalty costs. We develop stochastic dynamic optimization models of the backup resource-provisioning problem, leading to cost-effective resource-management policies in different practical settings. We present two sets of dynamic provisioning strategies: periodic policies, where resources are adjusted at regular intervals, and aperiodic policies that allow flexible timing of such interventions. A closed-loop (CL) optimization model under conservative resource control and a certainty-equivalent (CE) optimization model under aggressive resource control are developed for periodic resource management. Similarly, aperiodic resource management is modeled by using two different strategies: single intervention with single look-ahead (SISL) and multiple interventions with single look-ahead (MISL). Online optimization algorithms for both the periodic and aperiodic models are developed. The worst-case behavior of the algorithms is studied by using competitive ratio analysis and the expected behavior by using computational investigations. By using these studies, managerial guidelines for choosing the best resource-management strategy under different client-specific, service-specific, and system-specific resource-optimization conditions are presented. We validate our models based on use cases constructed from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) with their actual pricing and service-credit data. The practical guidelines from this study will aid contract administrators in cloud data centers to both efficiently formulate service-level agreements and cost-effectively manage the virtual infrastructure resources committed in such agreements.",60032083,"University at Buffalo, The State University of New York",Buffalo,United States,"['1710', '1705']",23.09090909090909,0.04428571428571428,0.3326556776556776,0

12,12,A multi-filter feature selection in detecting distributed denial-of-service attack,"Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) has become the most intrusive security threat on the Internet. Flash crowd attack is the most challenging problem among the attacks which targeting the web server during the Flash Events (FEs). It mimics the behaviour of legitimate users and sends high rate malicious traffics toward the server and block the normal users from using the desired services. Thus, making it hard to detect and successfully bypasses the detection mechanism. The key semantic difference between FEs and DDoS is that the former represents legitimate access of the website while the latter does not. However, this does not help in discriminating them automatically. The behavioural differences between the two have to be developed after understanding their individual properties. In this research, a Multi-Filter Feature Selection (M2FS) method is proposed by combining the 3 filter methods which are Information Gain (IG), Gain Ratio (GR) and ReliefF. It consists of 3-stage procedures: feature ranking, feature selection and classification. Subsequently, an experimental evaluation of the proposed Multi-Filter Feature Selection (M2FS) method is performed by using the benchmark dataset, NSL-KDD and employed the J48 classification algorithm. The performance of the proposed M2FS method is evaluated by multi-criteria that take into account which are classification accuracy, True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR) and time to build the model. Meanwhile, the performance of effectiveness of the proposed M2FS method is then compared with the existing feature selection methods and also the proposed M2FS with PCA. In addition, the proposed M2FS method is developed through WEKA API with Java Programming language using the IDE of Eclipse Java. The findings show that the proposed M2FS method is effectively reduced the 41 features to 14 features and produced a high accuracy, high TPR, low FPR and shorter time build when compared to other existing feature selection methods.",60017880,Universiti Malaysia Sabah,Kota Kinabalu,Malaysia,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.642857142857142,0.16382081686429514,0.520764163372859,1

It exhibits linearithmic computational complexity and avoids the usage of real numbers thanks to a divide and conquer, or multiscale, approach with a loose definition of discrete lines. Even so, a careful inspection of multiscale definition of DRT, introduced by several authors on late 90s, has allowed us to expose additional levels of fine and coarse parallelism, which is beneficial for the efficient detection of line patterns in signals at high rates even on mobile devices.

17,17,Seeing the trees or the forest? The effect of IT project managers’ mental construal on IT project risk management activities," Knowing when to pay attention to the trees versus the forest may play an important role in IT project risk management. We draw on construal level theory (CLT) to offer a fresh theoretical perspective on IT project risk management as it is uniquely suited to understanding why IT PMs may focus on the forest (abstract, high-level construal) or the trees (concrete, low-level construal). Specifically, we integrate CLT with IT project risk management and theorize how IT PMs’ mental construal affects four key IT project risk management activities: (1) risk identification, (2) risk impact assessment, (3) risk response planning, and (4) risk response enactment. We recruited a total of 805 IT PMs for this research and conducted a series of four laboratory experiments. In our experiments, we found that seeing the trees is beneficial in risk identification, risk impact assessment, and risk response planning. Specifically, we found that a concrete (relative to abstract) mental construal of a project leads IT PMs to identify a greater number of risks associated with the project (Experiment 1), and a concrete (relative to abstract) mental construal of a project risk leads IT PMs to perceive a greater potential impact of the risk (Experiment 2) and to perceive that more effort and resources are required for responding to the risk (Experiment 3). In contrast, we found that seeing the forest is beneficial in risk response enactment in that an abstract (relative to concrete) mental construal of a risk response leads IT PMs to be more willing to enact the risk response (Experiment 4).",60116456,Haslam College of Business,Knoxville,United States,"['1710', '1705']",36.857142857142854,0.11562499999999999,0.4625000000000001,0

19,19,Deeply integrating C11 code support into Isabelle/PIDE," Tuong and B. Wolff.We present a framework for C code in C11 syntax deeply integrated into the Isabelle/PIDE development environment. Our framework provides an abstract interface for verification back-ends to be plugged-in independently. Thus, various techniques such as deductive program verification or white-box testing can be applied to the same source, which is part of an integrated PIDE document model. Semantic back-ends are free to choose the supported C fragment and its semantics. In particular, they can differ on the chosen memory model or the specification mechanism for framing conditions. Our framework supports semantic annotations of C sources in the form of comments. Annotations serve to locally control back-end settings, and can express the term focus to which an annotation refers. Both the logical and the syntactic context are available when semantic annotations are evaluated. As a consequence, a formula in an annotation can refer both to HOL or C variables. Our approach demonstrates the degree of maturity and expressive power the Isabelle/PIDE subsystem has achieved in recent years. Our integration technique employs Lex and Yacc style grammars to ensure efficient deterministic parsing. We present two case studies for the integration of (known) semantic back-ends in order to validate the design decisions for our back-end interface.",60106208,Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique,Gif-sur-Yvette,France,['1712'],15.923076923076923,0.14404761904761904,0.33452380952380956,0

We then calibrate the HMM using a longitudinal data set, obtained from a major international video gaming company, that contains detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers’ playing histories over a period of 29 months comprising more than 700,000 unique game rounds. We find that high-, medium-, and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations, such as feelings of effectance and need for challenge. In the second stage, we use the results from the first stage to develop a matching algorithm that learns (infers) the gamer’s current engagement state “on the fly” and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play.

Peer assessment is usually used to overcome these objective obstacles, although unmoderated peer assessment is questioned by experts and is not trusted much by students (and thus, accordingly, entails a decreasing motivation as students withhold from assessing performance of their peers and withdraw from learning platforms). The works dedicated to this issue mainly deal with multiple ways to resolve it within the scope of the programmers' approach or the approach of the training platform moderators. Our study deals with the question of whether correctly formulated assignments and a methodologically justified sequence of assignments help to overcome these difficulties. The study was performed with the use of questionnaires for students of various academic years (2017-2019) taking part in one MOOC, and with quantitative and qualitative analysis of the performed assignments for peer assessment for 2017 (within the scope of that session, 947 answers were given to the self-assessment assignments, and 727 answers were given to the assignments for peer assessment). The result of the study was a supported recommendation to authors of the MOOC profile in humanities, wherein the essay was supposed to be the student’s expected answer: 1) there should be a clear correlation between the conditions of the assignment setting and the criteria used for assessment of the assignment for peer assessment; 2) self-assessment assignments built on the basis of the same principle as the peer assessment assignments should be included in the course.",60031888,Saint Petersburg State University,Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",40.57142857142857,0.029824561403508778,0.3929824561403509,1
24,24,A dynamic model of embeddedness in digital infrastructures," In this paper, we identify three processes by which individual systems become embedded into digital infrastructures. First, there are parallel processes, in which systems become embedded independently of each other. Second, there are competitive processes, in which the embeddedness of one system increases at the expense of another. Finally, there are spanning processes, in which bridges are built between different embedded systems. The three processes, synthesized into a dynamic model of digital infrastructure embeddedness, offer much-needed conceptual clarity to the area of digital infrastructure evolution. They also provide insight into the emergence of three forms of digital infrastructures: silofied, regenerated, and unified.

New technologies, the information revolution are the most important components of this process, the engine of the development of modern society. Currently, there is a digitalization of all aspects of human activity. First of all, it concerns the mass media. The 21st century has created a new information space, a new media sphere, where the transformation of modern journalism is taking place under the influence of digital technologies, which is becoming convergent, multimedia. The methods of training journalists, media industry specialists are changing, new disciplines are being introduced that meet the increased requirements of the time. The media segmentation has increased: new network, television and radio formats have appeared, new genres have increased, the influx of diverse information in different types of communication has increased many times. The model of communication interaction is changing, social communications have appeared, the possibilities of the masses of communication have increased: interactivity, multimedia, personalization of information, globalization, hypertexts, responsiveness, mobility, multifunctionality.

27,27,A stochastic geometry approach to modeling time hopping based TDOA in 3D indoor localization,"Indoor localization has greatly leveraged applications regarding to location based service (LBS), which witnesses ever-increasing impact on human life. Time difference of arrival (TDOA) is one of the most widely used technique for indoor localization because of its low complexity and high positioning accuracy. However, the strong multiple access interference (MAI) is a crucial issue that affects the accuracy of TDOA in indoor positioning, in order to mitigate interference, we incorporate time-hopping (TH) in TDOA technology, which can effectively reduce the interference at the transmitting side. Particularly, we propose an analytical model to evaluate the performance of the TH based TDOA in 3D indoor scenario by using the tool of stochastic geometry. 'rough the proposed model, we obtain some easy-to-use expressions for key performance metrics. The analytical results include the average interference, the success probability (i.e. the probability of a base station (BS) that can successfully participate in the localization procedure), and the number of effective serving BSs that has successfully participated in. In addition, some special cases are analyzed in detail, which reveals interesting insights.

Design intend to maximise the load carrying capacity of the drive side of asymmetric gear by increasing the pressure angle is achieved at the expense of coast side capacity. Multiple solution for coast to drive side pressure angle exist for a given contact ratio and each of these have relative merits and demerits. In the present work asymmetric spur gears of theoretically equal contact ratio as that of corresponding symmetric gears are selected to investigate the change in gear tooth static transmission error and dynamic behaviour with coast and drive side pressure angle. Study shows that dynamic factor of normal contact ratio asymmetric spur gears below resonance speed are relatively lower than corresponding symmetric gears of same module, contact ratio, number of teeth, coast side pressure angle and fillet radii.

30,30,How mega is the mega? Exploring the spillover effects of Wechat using graphical model," Little is known, however, about its externality in the broader app market. This work estimates the spillover effects of WeChat on the other top 50 most frequently used apps in China, using users’ weekly app usage data. Given the challenge of determining causal inference from observational data, we apply a graphical model and an econometric method to estimate the spillover effects in two steps: (1) we determine the causal structure by estimating a partially ancestral diagram, using a fast causal inference algorithm; and (2) given the causal structure, we find a valid adjustment set and estimate the causal effects by an econometric model with the adjustment set for controlling noncausal effects. Our findings show that the spillover effects of WeChat are limited; in fact, only two other apps, Tencent News and Taobao, receive positive spillover effects from WeChat. In addition, we show that if researchers fail to account for the causal structure that is determined from the graphical model, it is easy to fall into the trap of confounding bias and selection bias when estimating causal effects. The findings generate managerial implications in terms of app usage patterns, strategic management of mega apps on an app platform, and app promotional strategies for app platform managers and app developers.",60116864,School of Management Fudan University,Shanghai,China,"['1710', '1705']",34.833333333333336,0.0072626777983920855,0.5194032158317873,0

Although some consumers may do their research about in-app prices before deciding whether to buy the app, others only discover the in-app prices later in the purchase process. This paper presents an analytical model to examine the profit and welfare implications of hidden prices of the in-app purchases. This paper has three main contributions. First, it finds a profit-improvement effect of hidden prices under circumstances for which prior literature finds profit irrelevance. In this regard, the model identifies a new mechanism driving the profit-improvement result. Second, it finds when app developers can be made better off by platforms disclosing in-app purchase prices. Third, it shows how platform decisions intended to improve pricing transparency may actually diminish consumer welfare. We also consider a model variation whereby app developers can shroud in-app prices. The findings have implications for app developers considering hidden in-app purchases, as well as platforms such as Google, Apple, and Amazon, which can restrict this practice.",60116364,Foster School of Business,Seattle,United States,"['1710', '1705']",17.6,0.014884135472370767,0.2983065953654189,1

In a platform market model, demand-side users seek answers from supply-side users because such answers can indicate value offered, reduce buyer uncertainty, and offer social proof. Analyzing user-generated content on the Q&A forum of a prominent healthcare portal, we find that the introduction of doctors’ responses has a significant causal impact on demand-side user perception of medical services offered. More importantly, our research suggests that doctors’ specialty, experience, qualifications, transparency in appointment booking, service fees, and response quality moderate the effect of doctors’ Q&A responses on user recommendations. These results demonstrate that because of information asymmetry in healthcare, doctors use thoughtful online responses not only to socially interact with patients but also to signal their expertise.",60122769,Warrington College of Business,Gainesville,United States,"['1710', '1705']",26.4,0.20378787878787874,0.5643939393939393,1

40,40,The aspects of destructive influence of technical means and technologies of telecommunications on the person and society as a whole,"In the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, information processing and information and communication technologies (ICT) are actively used in all areas of socio-economic relations. In fact, they are the driver of the formation and dynamic development of the global information society. Information systems, hardware and software systems, mobile devices and applications today allow you to successfully solve many important tasks of practical activity in the economy, social sphere, medicine, education, management infrastructure of megacities and even in politics. The consequence of the effective use of ICT is the formation of completely new social, economic and political activities of mankind, striving for progress and ensuring its existence in harmony with nature.

42,42,Using technology to persuade: Visual representation technologies and consensus seeking in virtual teams," In this article, we (1) theoretically extend Fogg’s ideas by identifying contexts in which virtual teams are more likely to use persuasive technologies; (2) empirically measure technology visualness, a factor that likely makes technologies more or less persuasive; and (3) assess the association between the use of persuasive technologies, judgment shifts, and forecast performance in a real-world virtual team context. We identify visual representation technologies (VRTs) as a class of technologies used by virtual teams to select, transform, and present data in a rich visual format. We propose that such technologies play a persuasive, as well as diagnostic, role in virtual team decisions. Over a three-year period, we examine the daily chat room discussions and decisions of a virtual team that makes smog forecasts with large economic and health consequences. We supplement regression models of field data with an experiment, interviews with team members, and analyses of imagery processing and group cohesion in team language use. Experiment results show that, relative to non-VRTs, the use of a VRT in a forecasting task increases imagery processing. Field data results show that team members increase their use of VRTs during chat room discussions when initial team consensus is low and the environment is more exacting. Greater use of VRTs in team discussions relates to greater shifts in the initial to final consensus forecasts of the team and greater odds of the team shifting its forecast policy to issue a smog alert. Increased use of VRTs is associated with lower forecast bias but is not significantly associated with forecast accuracy. VRT use is also associated with greater imagery processing and increased group cohesion, as shown through language use.",60116662,Scheller College of Business,Atlanta,United States,"['1710', '1705']",27.6,0.15519688644688648,0.37770146520146525,0

44,44,How do EHRs and a meaningful use initiative affect breaches of patient information?," In this study, we examine how the adoption of EHRs and an MU initiative affect the occurrence of breaches of patient information. We also study whether and how EHRs and MU initiatives may increase the risk of accidental and malicious breaches of patient information. Using data from multiple sources, such as the American Hospital Association (AHA), the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) AnalyticsÔ Database, and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC), our study shows that implementing EHRs leads to a 3.081 times higher risk of a breach of patient information. This heightened risk is mostly driven by the occurrence of more accidental breaches. Although the effect of an MU initiative on the overall number of breaches is not significant, undertaking MU increases the risk of accidental breaches 1.771 times. We also found that these risks increased more among relatively larger hospitals. However, simply having more components of EHRs does not necessarily increase the risk of breaches. Overall, our findings show that breaches of patient information may be rooted in the digitized data and processes enabled by technologies such as EHRs and their usage rather than resident in the technological components themselves. We conclude that, despite recent evidence that usage of EHRS has improved the quality of healthcare, quality must go hand in hand with the protection of patient information.",60016912,Yonsei University,Seoul,South Korea,"['1710', '1705']",24.555555555555557,0.12890625,0.40513392857142855,0
45,45,Does superposition influence the success of floss projects? An examination of open-source software development by organizations and individuals," This work orchestration mechanism is different from the traditional idea of software development, where the focus is toward cowork and concurrent development facilitated by a modular software design architecture. Our study theorizes and examines the motivational mechanisms that operate within superposed work structures to influence the success of FLOSS projects. We also unearth the contextual conditions that may limit the influence of the superposed nature of work on FLOSS project success. Furthermore, given the increasing use of FLOSS by organizations, we investigate the specificities brought to these motivational mechanisms when FLOSS projects are owned by organizations. The results from our analysis of over 6,500 FLOSS projects hosted on GitHub support a nonlinear relationship between the degree of superposition and the success of the FLOSS project. Moreover, we find that the type of ownership moderates this nonlinear relationship such that (1) organizational ownership mitigates the influence of the degree of superposition on the success of the project and that (2) under organizational ownership, the optimal degree of superposition (the point at which the success of the project is at a maximum) is lower than for individual-owned projects. This research advances our understanding of work structures, motivation, and organizational participation in FLOSS environments by describing the influence of task structures on the success of projects. The study also provides FLOSS practitioners with valuable insights for modeling project task structures to facilitate their success.",60068566,École des hautes études commerciales de Paris,Jouy-en-Josas,France,"['1710', '1705']",29.0,0.21000000000000002,0.185,0

Doing so restricts internet openness, also known as network neutrality, in the fast-lane internet. Opponents of a two-tier internet believe it would hinder innovation, motivate underinvestment in internet infrastructure, and, consequently, reduce the quality of service (QoS) of the open internet. The challenge is for policy to balance a fee-based fast lane for priority traffic and safeguard against the viability of the open internet. In our model, edge providers choose output levels and internet type; a broadband provider chooses investment in internet capacity and pricing for prioritizing traffic in the fast lane; and a policy maker chooses a mechanism for balancing openness and prioritization in a two-tier internet. We find that edge providers with greater bandwidth requirements per unit of output convert to the fast lane, which can drive innovation from edge providers with high bandwidth requirements. The broadband provider chooses fixed fee pricing for the fast lane but has no incentive to increase investment in internet capacity as long as the open internet is not monetized. So long as there are no investments in internet capacity, all edge providers of the open internet and their end users are worse off with a two-tier internet. To maintain the QoS of the open internet and to increase social welfare, a two-tier internet has to be coupled with a policy mechanism, whereby a portion of broadband provider profit is invested in internet capacity.",60134855,Haskayne School of Business,Calgary,Canada,"['1710', '1705']",28.3,0.0846666666666667,0.4953333333333333,1
48,48,Unraveling the “social” in social norms: The conditioning effect of user connectivity," However, very few studies examine how the effect of social norms is differentially manifest across individuals, especially in the contemporary socially connected digital world. We conjecture that the effects of social norms are conditional on an individual’s digital social ties and provide new empirical evidence from a randomized field experiment that included more than 7,000 individuals on an online physical activity community observed for a two-month period. In our investigation of the effect of social norms on users’ goal-setting and goal attainment behaviors, we find a significant moderating role for social connectivity: individuals with higher levels of social connectivity are more susceptible to a social norms message containing information indicating the number of users in this community who set a goal in the pretreatment month. Additional analysis reveals that individuals who have many followers (i.e., high in-degree) but do not follow many others (low out-degree) are the most susceptible to the social norms treatment. Strikingly, we find that social norms also lead to a substantially lower rate of goal attainment compared with the control message that simply highlights the benefits of setting a goal. This adverse effect is also heterogeneously experienced, conditional on the number of social ties. Our findings have important implications for the design of interventions based on social norms.",60138278,Kelley School of Business,Bloomington,United States,"['1710', '1705']",30.428571428571427,0.1625891265597148,0.3284180035650624,0

50,50,Social aspects of human-computer interactions in the media: Tendencies and threats," Publication rights licensed to ACM.In today's world, all the most important events and changes in economic and cultural relations take place within the information community. It is impossible to gain authority and a place among the partners of this community without the development of democracy in each particular state. It is also impossible without the use of computer technologies, but such use should not contradict international standards of human-computer interaction and standards of information protection. Special attention of researchers in the field of mass communications sociology and media psychology is attracted by the pervasion of human-computer interaction problems into mass media discourse, which accumulates a significant part of public discourse as a whole. The paper presents the results of an online expert survey of professional journalists discussing the impact of computer networks on their ""actors"", groups and communities. In the mainstream of interdisciplinarity, using the anthropocentric and sociocommunicative approaches, the social aspects of human-computer interactions in the media are studied. The chosen methodology allows to focus on the most relevant of them, such as: the need for humanization of communicative contacts in networks and mass media, recognition of changes in the structure of audiences, increasing the role of subjectivity and personification of contacts. The problem for future human-computer interactions (HCI) research is that the further computer science - and therefore technology - advances, the more often we have to think about the balance between benefits and harms caused to humans by active interaction with the computer.",60027251,V.

Generally, it is well known that numerical differentiation of noisy position signals even with significant filtering is no viable solution. This is especially true for computing joint acceleration. Specifically, our solution to this problem fuses joint position measurement with link accelerometers, which are affordable and easy to install. Since the sensor readings are affected by noise, drift and bias, suitable data fusion and filtering methods are proposed for improving the estimation for practical use. Simulation results based on a realistic dynamics model of a 7-DoF robot including various parasitic effects and experimental results with a 7-DoF robot demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. This method would have multiple use, e.g., in monitoring external joint torques and handle possibly unforeseen collisions. Furthermore, other applications such as load identification and compensation as well as state feedback linearization for flexible joint robots could finally become possible also practical.",60117697,Munich School of Robotics and Machine Intelligence,Munich,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.375,0.15,0.5882352941176471,1

A multiple point of view recording helps to capture the whole surgery, not only the operated eye but also the doctor's hand movement and the room's environment. To determine which device can produce the clearest video, the resulting videos from each device were filtered with Laplacian method from OpenCV library. The higher variance a video produces, the better the result. From the experiment, video recorded on Samsung Note 8 has the best result, compare to other smartphones and mirrorless camera. Device placement also matters, as it determines how clear the object will be captured in the video. In case of two devices capturing the same object, the placement angle does not have to be the same, as long as the object can be clearly captured.

58,58,Word-of-mouth system implementation and customer conversion: A randomized field experiment,"E-commerce firms often face the decision on whether they should implement a word-of-mouth (WOM) system on their websites. An in-site WOM system can potentially boost customer conversion by conveying signals and information about product popularity and quality. However, implementing such a system might also have unintended consequences, hindering product sales because of the lack of control over WOM volume and content. This study examines how implementing a WOM system (through social media integration) on an e-commerce website affects customer conversion in the two stages of the consumer purchase funnel, namely, adding a product to the cart and placing an order. Identifying the causal effect of WOM system implementation is challenging because e-commerce websites usually make their decisions based on private information about the potential impact of the system and may have simultaneously implemented other initiatives that could confound the effect. As a result, we conducted a randomized field experiment in collaboration with a large e-commerce website in the United States by testing two versions of a web page: one with a WOM system (treatment) and one without (control). We find that the impact of a WOM system implementation on customer conversion is moderated by WOM volume such that its effect is positive above a threshold of volume (measured by the number of comments) and negative below the threshold. Additionally, we find that WOM valence reinforces the impact of a WOM system on customer conversion. These results suggest that a social-learning mechanism is in play. Furthermore, our results show that the impact of a WOM system mostly occurs at the consideration stage in the upper purchase funnel (adding a product to the cart) rather than at the evaluation stage in the lower funnel (placing an order). Our study not only contributes to research on online system design but also offers practical implications for implementing and managing WOM systems on e-commerce websites.",60116379,W. P.

61,61,Multidimensional information systems metadata repository development with a data warehouse structure using “data vault” methodology,"When organizing automated data collection in a data warehouse under the conditions of increasing data volume and complicating the business model of an enterprise, an information system data model control becomes one of the priority tasks. The article discusses a method of metadata repository developing in terms of metadata responsible for describing business objects and the relationships between them. The choice of “Data vault” determines the construction of a data warehouse within the framework of an information system based on the classical design approach with a 3-level data presentation architecture, which includes a data preparation area, or an online data warehouse, data warehouse and thematic data marts. The proposed approach allows organizing data storage within the data warehouse using a metadata repository based on the multidimensional organization principle. The metadata repository is responsible for the data collection process, the data storage process, and the presentation of data for analysis. The metadata repository is presented in the form of a metamodel that is semantically related to the domain of the system, is easily reconstructed in case of changes in the business model of the domain, and allows data marts to be created with the structure of a multidimensional data model based on the Star relational scheme. This allows you to organize the human-computer interaction when describing a metamodel, using mainly knowledge about the structure of the subject area. When describing a metamodel, the first-order predicate calculus language is used, which makes it possible to control the metamodel using a declarative programming style - the “Prolog” language. The key point in the structure of the information system is the way of transition from the “Data vault” model to a multidimensional data representation model based on associative rules of dependence between information objects.",60099167,Program Systems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences,Pereslavl-Zalessky,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",32.22222222222222,0.08333333333333334,0.5,1
62,62,A Modulation technique for Sensorless control of Switched reluctance Motor,"The switched reluctance motor (SRM) uniquely bears several merits with respect to other motor configurations. Especially, the construction of the rotor is simple in the sense that it neither contains copper not contains permanent magnets. Because of this construction, likelihood of rotor’s failure is less than the other motor configurations. This makes this motor more suitable for harsh environments. On the flip side, this motor cannot directly operate with AC or DC power source and needs electronic commutation. For commutation, the information on instantaneous orientation of the rotor is essential. Since inclusion of appropriate sensor adds to the cost and complexity of the system, sensor-less commutation of SRM gained interest among the researchers and has been studied extensively in literature. The techniques for sensorless control of SRM can be broadly classified into Active phase and Idle phase techniques. Idle phase techniques are generally believed to be not suitable for high speed operation beause of tail current in a phase, i.e., because of inductive nature of the phase, it takes time for flow of current to stop. This paper proposes a novel idle phase technique that is conducive for high speed operation of switched reluctance motor.",60015465,Defence Research and Development Organisation India,Dehradun,India,['1706'],19.5,0.04851449275362319,0.4782453416149068,1

65,65,Algorithmization of calculations of the kolmogorov-nikol'skii constants for values of approximations of conjugated differentiable functions by generalized poisson integrals,"In applied mathematics in solving a number of problems, it is advisable to use the methods and approaches of the theory of approximation of functions. One of the most important types of problems, of both the theory of approximation of functions and applied mathematics, is the so-called extremal problems of Kolmogorov-Nikol'skii. The essence of the Kolmogorov-Nikol'skii problem in applied mathematics is the approximation of some mathematical objects by others, usually of a simpler nature, whose properties are already known, and the necessary characteristics are calculated in one way or another. In this case, an important role is played by the error estimate of the obtained approximation, which will directly depend on the accuracy of solving the Kolmogorov-Nikol'skii problem. And this accuracy will directly depend on the number of terms in complete asymptotic expansions (by the powers (1-ρ) ρ→1-0 , in this article). The constants that face the corresponding degrees (1-ρ), ρ→1-0 in complete asymptotic expansions in applied mathematics are called the Kolmogorov-Nikol'skii constants. Obviously, the more one knows these Kolmogorov-Nikol'skii constants, the more accurately one can get the degree of error when some mathematical objects are approximated by others. An algorithm has been developed for computing the Kolmogorov-Nikol'skii constants of arbitrarily high order of smallness when approximating conjugate differentiable functions by their generalized Poisson integrals. The result obtained in this paper will allow one to expand significantly the boundaries of the application of problems of the theory of approximation in applied mathematics, namely, when constructing numerical algorithms, when considering optimal control problems, in mathematical modeling of complex technical and ecological systems, etc.",60103609,Lesya Ukrainka Eastern European National University,Lutsk,Ukraine,"['1712', '1710']",29.11111111111111,0.16295454545454546,0.46810606060606064,1
66,66,Dynamics of the student youth's value paradigm changes in the information society,"The paper focuses on the dynamics of the student youth's value paradigm changes occurring in the process are influenced by the following of various factors: technical progress, which has accelerated the automation and computerization of modern society, the emergence of new types of communication in the virtual environment, the process of globalization, which has opened not only new opportunities for rapid integration into the world economic system, but also exacerbated the problem of compatibility of different civilizational patterns and cultures. New perspectives that have appeared through the information society development (the emergence of new classes as a result of the social structure reforms, network social communications, socioeconomic and spiritual-cultural transformation of superethnoses) are ambiguous and contradictory and can provoke a crisis of personal and collective identity of a modern young person. In this regard, the problem of formation of a socially important ideal for the further stable existence of society, as well as the search for positive meanings in the process of individual self-actualization, the choice of values by new generations with due regard to the experience of previous generations is topical.

69,69,Dynamic of hashtag functions development in new media Hashtag as an identificational mark of digital communication in social networks," Publication rights licensed to ACM.The article is devoted to the study of the hashtag functioning as an operational tool for new media. The relevance of the study is determined by the insufficient knowledge of the hashtag as a linguistic phenomenon, while it is the most important unit that determines the development of interactive media (in particular, social networks) at the present stage. The purpose of this article is to study the features of the localization of the hashtag on the Instagram social network, as well as the spectrum of its functionality. The main attention is paid to the specific formal characteristics of the hashtag (graphic appearance, position in relation to the text, grammatical features) and the functions performed - both in the network space and beyond. Considering the functionality of the hashtag on Instagram, the authors of the article note that it acts, firstly, as a navigation tool that allows you to instantly search for publications on topics of interest. Secondly, the hashtag is a powerful tool for marketing promotion in the social network of a product or service. Thirdly, the hashtag can act as an evaluation marker that can set the interpretation model of the message marked by the addressee, which indicates its manipulative potential. Fourth, the hashtag discovers the ability to form a network of certain associations fixed in the minds of people to a particular event, person, subject, situation, thus finding itself closely related to the features of the conceptualization of reality. And finally, the hashtag is recognized as a unique phenomenon that went beyond the scope of online space and determined the specifics of the new era of communication in the digital world, as well as in real life. At the same time, the hashtag functions may vary depending on the communicative intentions of the author who uses it in his publication.

A PLC program consists of inputs (whose values are given at runtime by factory sensors), outputs (whose values are given at runtime to factory actuators), and the logical expressions computing output values from input values. Due to the graphical form of Ladder programs, and the amount of inputs and outputs in typical industrial programs, debugging such programs is time-consuming and error-prone. We present, in this paper, a Why3-based tool research prototype we have implemented for automating the use of deductive verification in order to provide an easy-to-use and robust debugging tool for Ladder programmers.",60101699,Mitsubishi Electric Corporation,Tokyo,Japan,['1712'],20.0,-0.02361111111111111,0.33749999999999997,0
71,71,Speeding up generalized PSR parsers by memoization techniques,"Predictive shift-reduce (PSR) parsing for hyperedge replacement (HR) grammars is very efficient, but restricted to a subclass of unambiguous HR grammars. To overcome this restriction, we have recently extended PSR parsing to generalized PSR (GPSR) parsing along the lines of Tomita-style generalized LR parsing. Unfortunately, GPSR parsers turned out to be too inefficient without manual tuning. This paper proposes to use memoization techniques to speed up GPSR parsers without any need of manual tuning, and which has been realized within the graph parser distiller GRAPPA. We present running time measurements for some example languages; they show a significant speed up by some orders of magnitude when parsing valid graphs. But memoization techniques do not help when parsing invalid graphs or if all parses of an ambiguous input graph shall be determined.",60018276,Universität der Bundeswehr München,Neubiberg,Germany,['1712'],21.833333333333332,0.015000000000000003,0.485,1
72,72,System approach to assessing of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of information," Publication rights licensed to ACM.The approach to a systemically consistent analysis of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of information and assessment from the position of decision makers of their impact on the validity, reliability and effectiveness of solving systemic problems is proposed. From the position of the decision maker the basic definitions of the qualitative characteristics of the informedness of the decision maker, such as completeness, reliability and timeliness are formulated. When considering from a position of a system analysis problems the qualitative properties of informedness of the qualitative characteristics of the informedness of the decision maker are given. A proposed integral indicator of informedness is takes into account the degree and level of influence of each of the introduced qualitative indicators on the degree of achievement of the goals of the decision-maker. In the formation of an integrated indicator of the decision-maker's knowledge, certain properties and features of qualitative indicators are introduced in terms of completeness, reliability and timeliness. Informedness level is introduced: it is a measure of the possibility of analyzing many situations. A measure of opportunity is used in the interpretation of the theory of opportunity. There are contradictions between the level of completeness and reliability of informedness, on the one hand, and the level of timeliness, on the other. Therefore, the important task is the search of a rational compromise between the levels of completeness, reliability and timeliness in the process of forming a solution, while taking into account the requirements for reducing the time to do it. Based on the above approach, the operation of the power supply unit of a computing system is investigated taking into account four situations and a seven of risk factors that bring the system into an emergency mode. The allowable time interval is calculated during which the computer system will work in the normal mode, while taking into account the completeness, reliability and timeliness, will work in the normal mode. This problem is solved in human-machine interaction mode.",60025383,Southern Federal University,Rostov-on-Don,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",27.416666666666668,0.15392857142857141,0.47214285714285714,0

74,74,Impact of live chat on purchase in electronic markets: The moderating role of information cues," The role of live chat in the e-commerce environment, however, is largely underexplored. Using granular data from Alibaba, we examine the effect of live chat on consumers’ purchase decisions. After controlling for the selection process that customers with high purchase intention are more likely to initiate live chat in the first place, we find that live chat can increase purchase probability of tablets by 15.99%. We also investigate how the effect of live chat is moderated by existing information cues: product sales volume and seller feedback score. The substitutional or complementary patterns allow us to understand how live chat tools change the ways consumers evaluate product quality and seller credibility. We observe a substitutional effect of live chat on seller feedback score such that sellers with low feedback score benefit more from live chat conversations than sellers with high score. On the contrary, products with high past sales volume sell better after live chat, indicating a reinforcement effect. Such findings deepen our understanding of the difference between various information cues in electronic markets. As one of the first systematic studies to investigate live chat, our paper contributes to web trust conceptual frameworks with empirical analyses and sheds light on practical decisions faced by e-vendors and platform designers.",60138278,Kelley School of Business,Bloomington,United States,"['1710', '1705']",23.11111111111111,0.15955266955266953,0.48389770723104053,0
75,75,Fast 3D integrated circuit placement methodology using merging technique,"In the recent years the advancement in the field of microelectronics integrated circuit (IC) design technologies proved to be a boon for design and development of various advanced systems in-terms of its reduction in form factor, low power, high speed and with increased capacity to incorporate more designs. These systems provide phenomenal advantage for armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) design to develop miniaturised low power, high performance subsystems. One such emerging high-end technology to be used to develop systems with high capabilities for AFVs is discussed in this paper. Three dimensional IC design is one of the emerging field used to develop high density heterogeneous systems in a reduced form factor. A novel grouping based partitioning and merge based placement (GPMP) methodology for 3D ICs to reduce through silicon vias (TSVs) count and placement time is proposed. Unlike state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed methodology does not suffer from initial overlap of cells during intra-layer placement which reduces the placement time. Connectivity based grouping and partitioning ensures less number of TSVs and merge based placement further reduces intra layer wire-length. The proposed GPMP methodology has been extensively against the IBMPLACE database and performance has been compared with the latest techniques resulting in 12 per cent improvement in wire-length, 13 per cent reduction in TSV and 1.1x improvement in placement time.",60103917,Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad,Hyderabad,India,['1706'],27.125,0.13960784313725488,0.43588235294117644,1

A cognitive approach for the text classification issues is presented. An algorithm to identify the words basic level using WordNet is considered. A model for text classification based on the pre-trained word embeddings is presented. The model consists of three layers: embedding layer Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, and softmax layer. The model was trained and evaluated on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. The classification quality was assessed by F-measure, precision and recall. The obtained results analysis is carried out. Both described models show good results, low scores for some texts are explained. The advantages and limitations of the linguistic models are shown. In future works the authors are going to combine proposed models and modify them. Thus, for model based on word embedding there are pretty vast opportunities for extension: from experimenting with different word embeddings and various distance metrics to more complicated architecture of layers and even promising state of the art artificial neural network models, activation functions and their modifications.

77,77,Fake news on social media: People believe what they want to believe when it makes no sense at All," All rights reserved.Fake news (i.e., misinformation) on social media has sharply increased in the past few years. We conducted a behavioral experiment with EEG data from 83 social media users to understand whether they could detect fake news on social media, and whether the presence of a fake news flag affected their cognition and judgment. We found that the presence of a fake news flag triggered increased cognitive activity and users spent more time considering the headline. However, the flag had no effect on judgments about truth; flagging headlines as false did not influence users' beliefs. A post hoc analysis shows that confirmation bias is pervasive, with users more likely to believe news headlines that align with their political opinions. Headlines that challenge their opinions receive little cognitive attention (i.e., they are ignored) and users are less likely to believe them.",60138278,Kelley School of Business,Bloomington,United States,"['1710', '1706']",23.666666666666668,-0.10162037037037039,0.48148148148148145,0
78,78,Application of Siamese neural networks for the type of emergency determination,"For reliable operation of systems for early detection and prevention of emergencies, their algorithms should use machine learning methods. The use of machine learning methods is associated with the replacement of detectors, usually used in such systems, with sensors that transmit the measurement results to the computing unit of the system. Measurement of the main factors, along with their threshold processing, allowed the use of machine learning methods to quickly detect the fact of ignition, determine the type of ignition source and its localization. The study is devoted to the development of a neural network algorithm for determining the type of fire in the early stages of an emergency. The results of emergency detection refresh the information of human-machine interface immediately. We proposed to use a complex neural network consisting of five Siamese networks based on distance and a Bayesian network. The proposed neural networks have a simple architecture and a small number of layers. To train the neural network, a computer model has been developed.

79,79,Tool support for validation of formal system models: Interactive visualization and requirements traceability," Kamburjan & J. Stromberg.Development processes in various engineering disciplines are incorporating formal models to ensure safety properties of critical systems. The use of these formal models requires to reason about their adequacy, i.e., to validate that a model mirrors the structure of the system sufficiently that properties established for the model indeed carry over to the real system. Model validation itself is non-formal, as adequacy is not a formal (i.e., mathematical) property. Instead it must be carried out by the modeler to justify the modeling to the certification agency or other stakeholders. In this paper we argue that model validation can be seen as a special form of requirements engineering, and that interactive visualization and concepts from requirements traceability can help to advance tool support for formal modeling by lowering the cognitive burden needed for validation. We present the VisualisierbaR tool, which supports the formal modeling of railway operations and describe how it uses interactive visualization and requirements traceability concepts to validate a formal model.",60011226,Technische Universität Darmstadt,Darmstadt,Germany,['1712'],23.714285714285715,0.061734693877551025,0.36377551020408166,0
80,80,An attribute-based mutual authentication scheme with time-bounded keys,"Remote user authentication scheme is an important technique for securely accessing the resources of servers. Traditionally, password-based authentication schemes are commonly adopted mechanisms, i.e., a user first chooses a password and then registers to the server for becoming a legitimate member. Nevertheless, such schemes are vulnerable to password guessing attacks and a remote server might have to maintain a password table for verifying users. In recent years, attribute-based cryptosystems have been received much attention. An attribute-based authentication scheme allows a remote system to verify a user's membership according to his/her owned attribute sets without using passwords. In 2015, Yun et al. proposed an improved attribute-based authentication protocol by utilizing Shamir's secret sharing technique. Their protocol is secure against man-in-the-middle, replay and collusion attacks. However, we find out that their scheme only achieves one-way authentication rather than mutual authentication. In this paper, we extend their work to further fulfill the crucial property of mutual authentication. Moreover, we incorporate the concept of time-bounded keys into the extended variant for providing more flexible applications in the real world.",60023529,National Taiwan Ocean University,Keelung,Taiwan,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",15.909090909090908,0.065,0.5341666666666667,1

An innovative real-time localization method based on calculation of the eigenvalues of the magnetic gradient tensor is proposed in this paper. The angle between displacement vector and magnetic moment vector can be expressed in terms of eigenvalues of the magnetic gradient tensor. In specific applications like localization of cooperative magnetic target of which the magnitude of the magnetic moment is known in advance, the distance between the target and the magnetic gradiometer can be derived using the magnetic tensor contraction. Numerical simulation result shows the robustness of the distance determination algorithm. What is more, the positioning principle in satellite navigation is introduced and applied to finally realize real-time localization. Simulation compares the method with another analytic localization method, and the result proves the high-precision of the method even under noisy environment.",60010080,Nanjing University of Science and Technology,Nanjing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.0,0.12314814814814816,0.5731481481481482,1
82,82,A metasurfaces review: Definitions and applications,"This paper is a critical review of metasurfaces, which are planar metamaterials. Metamaterials offer bespoke electromagnetic applications and novel properties which are not found in naturally occurring materials. However, owing to their 3D-nature and resonant characteristics, they suffer from manufacturing complexity, losses and are highly dispersive. The 2-dimensional nature of metasurfaces allows ease of fabrication and integration into devices. The phase discontinuity across the metasurface offers anomalous refraction, thereby conserving the good metamaterial properties while still offering the low-loss characteristics. The paper discusses salient features and applications of metasurfaces; wavefront shaping; phase jumps; non-linear metasurfaces; and their use as frequency selective surfaces (FSS).",60026851,University of Oxford,Oxford,United Kingdom,['1706'],17.166666666666668,0.21200000000000002,0.4680000000000001,1
83,83,Executable component-based semantics,"The potential benefits of formal semantics are well known. However, a substantial amount of work is required to produce a complete and accurate formal semantics for a major language; and when the language evolves, large-scale revision of the semantics may be needed to reflect the changes. The investment of effort needed to produce an initial definition, and subsequently to revise it, has discouraged language developers from using formal semantics. Consequently, many major programming languages (and most domain-specific languages) do not yet have formal semantic definitions. To improve the practicality of formal semantic definitions, the PLANCOMPS project has developed a component-based approach. In this approach, the semantics of a language is defined by translating its constructs (compositionally) to combinations of so-called fundamental constructs, or ‘funcons’. Each funcon is defined using a modular variant of Structural Operational Semantics, and forms a language-independent component that can be reused in definitions of different languages. A substantial library of funcons has been developed and tested in several case studies. Crucially, the definition of each funcon is fixed, and does not need changing when new funcons are added to the library. For specifying component-based semantics, we have designed and implemented a meta-language called CBS. It includes specification of abstract syntax, of its translation to funcons, and of the funcons themselves. Development of CBS specifications is supported by an integrated development environment. The accuracy of a language definition can be tested by executing the specified translation on programs written in the defined language, and then executing the resulting funcon terms using an interpreter generated from the CBS definitions of the funcons. This paper gives an introduction to CBS, illustrates its use, and presents the various tools involved in our implementation of CBS.",60020595,Royal Holloway University of London,Egham,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1703']",20.357142857142858,0.12125668449197861,0.4375222816399286,1

A survey of Omsk dwellers and interviews with experts was conducted to find out the characterizing potential of memes as a tool for the image of Omsk. The studies have confirmed the hypothesis of the authors. Memes have a powerful characterizing function. In the case of Omsk - negative. The basis of Omsk memes are the social problems that mostly concern city livers, and the characteristic of the region through the prism of memes is negative. The discussion with experts showed that the use of memes as a tool to create a positive image of Omsk is possible, but only in the case of a cardinal improvement in the social situation. The creators and distributors of memes are people living in the region, which means they must have positive motivation and a safe reality for replicating positive ideas, including the format of memes.",60015090,Omsk State Pedagogical University,Omsk,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",19.90909090909091,0.12491582491582492,0.5853535353535353,1

Difference in rheology if instead of nanoclay, an equal wt% of additional fumed silica is added to 20 per cent fumed silica-PEG200 STF, has been studied. At 25 °C, in case of addition of nanoclay the increase in critical viscosity is less than that observed for same additional amount of fumed silica. Interestingly, an opposite result is seen at higher temperatures i.e. 45 °C and 55 °C. Moreover, the difference in steady-state and dynamic state viscosity values decreases on addition of nanoclay. It is noted that an increase in concentration of clay increases the value of dynamic parameters whereas for STF of only fumed silica particles the values are constant irrespective of the change in concentration. More importantly, ease of processing, elasticity, stability and consistency of rheological results of STF increases to a significant extent on addition of relatively inexpensive nano-additive.",60001166,Thapar Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology,Patiala,India,['1706'],22.25,0.07990196078431373,0.39117647058823524,1

This research investigates how firms can actively manage consumer-generated reviews in the form of highlighting authentic reviews at firms’ discretion. Whereas highlighting a positive review is expected to lead to positive product evaluations, this practice may elicit consumers’ skepticism if consumers are explicitly informed of the promotional intent of the firm. In three studies, we examine the effect of presenting a firm-highlighted review on consumers’ consumption intention and behavior. Our findings confirm that highlighting a positive consumer review can effectively attract consumers’ attention to this review. However, the heightened attention does not always lead to higher consumption likelihood. In particular, the extremity of a highlighted review will interact with the variance of the review context as well as the reputation of the firm being reviewed to determine the effect of the firm-highlighting practice on consumers’ consumption behavior. When other reviews convey mixed opinions or when the firm has not established a strong reputation, highlighting a positive but less extreme review may effectively improve the likelihood of consumption, but highlighting a review that is extremely positive will not.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"['1710', '1705']",23.875,0.12181818181818183,0.526780303030303,1

90,90,Innovation and policy support for two-sided market platforms: Can government policy makers and executives optimize both societal value and profits?," Technological innovation requires difficult but critically important strategic decisions. Making good decisions becomes even more challenging for platforms tightly linked to network externalities that are inherent in two-sided markets. Inspired by the driverless car industry, which is now receiving green signals from available technology and government policies, this study introduces a model of competing IT platforms that use a complementary physical medium. The aim is to understand the possible incentives for technological innovation to inform decision makers from both industry and government. Although the existing literature on two-sided markets focuses on platform pricing strategies for network expansion, it pays little attention to decisions that involve high levels of innovation. For this reason, the study investigates how platforms can strike a balance between these two decision alternatives, namely price and improved quality from innovation. This study examines the conditions under which platforms receive incentives to innovate in the presence of network externalities. We also examine how equilibrium is influenced by technological asymmetry between the competing platforms, and consumers’ and service providers’ multihoming (i.e., choosing between multiple options) behavior. We extend focus to a government policy perspective by studying how to subsidize innovations. Three different policies are considered: (1) subsidies for consumers, (2) subsidies for service providers, and (3) innovation-based subsidies for platforms.

92,92,Toward a deeper understanding of competitive knowledge assets,"Knowledge management (KM) is founded on an underlying assumption that better management of knowledge assets will lead to more competitive success, including better financial performance. Demonstrating that relationship has always been a core concern of the discipline. KM scholarship has demonstrated that differences exist in knowledge assets, requiring different approaches for successfully exploiting them. With the growth of use of other intangibles such as big data systems and business analytics/intelligence, the strategic choices have become even more complex. Everything from expensive information technology-based KM systems to communities of practice, from data monitoring to predictive analytics might be appropriate in a given scenario. Metrics have developed to assess these different competitive situations, giving us a general idea of the levels of data, explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge, and intelligence in any given industry. The methodology and results have been extensively covered in other work and so will not be repeated here. But this paper starts from those established quantitative metrics. Thus, we know that industries such as pharmaceuticals require competence in managing all intangibles. Others, such as financial services, seem to develop very little knowledge even though big data and intelligence levels are very high. Alternatively, branded consumer goods often have high levels of knowledge but little intelligence. We can speculate on where particularly high intangible asset development, specifically in which particular areas (e.g. operations, marketing relationships, R&D). What we don't have is empirical evidence to back up such speculation. If the key competitive requirement, leading to better financial performance, is highly developed knowledge in operations, can we provide some data to support that conclusion? This paper will explore some additional metrics (key personnel, brand equity, social media sentiment), seeking to add to our more specific explanations about how and where intangibles matter. The point is to develop some more precise, more objective metrics allowing a deeper look inside organizations. If so, we can gain a better understanding how intangible assets, especially knowledge, contribute to competitiveness.",60025671,Marist College,Poughkeepsie,United States,"['1706', '1705']",19.058823529411764,0.13145108695652177,0.43674637681159423,1
93,93,"How pair programming influences team performance: The role of backup behavior, shared mental models, and task novelty"," We hypothesize that pair programming helps software development teams establish backup behavior by strengthening the shared mental models among developers. In turn, backup behavior attenuates the negative effect of task novelty on team performance. We collect data from the software developers, Scrum masters, and product owners of 62 software development teams in a global enterprise software firm and find broad support for our research model. The study makes important contributions by shifting attention to the team-level effects of pair programming and by explicating mediating and moderating mechanisms related to the roles of shared mental models, backup behavior, and task novelty. The results underline the importance of viewing pair programming as a context-specific practice that helps establish backup behavior in teams. In terms of implications for practitioners, our results show that pair programming can be a valuable element of team governance to create shared mental models and backup behavior and to achieve high team performance when teams face high levels of task novelty.",60122532,Muma College of Business,Tampa,United States,"['1710', '1705']",27.166666666666668,-0.0015909090909090975,0.3811363636363636,0
94,94,Parallelism as a universal principle of structuring information flows," Publication rights licensed to ACM.The article is aimed at highlighting the fact of the presence of common features inherent in various types of creative conscious activity of people. It is exemplified by the notion of parallelism in their intellectual work, in the way of creating new educational products. In live communication, the reflection of the process parallelism is a powerful universal mechanism to facilitate the perception of information of an unfamiliar nature based on experience in the field of one's own professional interests. Using the ability to parallelize various information flows with an emphasis on general patterns is a means of streamlining a relatively large amount of information in order to ensure its understanding. The article discusses examples of parallelism inherent in human literary activity. Syntactic parallelism or concurrency, a stylistic device for figurative speech, refers to imaginative means in literature. Syntactic parallelism as manifested in similar construction of related phrases, poetic lines, etc., is illustrated by the works of English and American classical literature, e.g. those of William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, John Fowles, Oscar Wilde, Edgar Poe, Robert Frost. In a natural connection with poetry is music, which is characterized by obvious manifestations of parallelism in various forms. Some of them allow algebraic formalization with the subsequent possibility of using the achievements of modern computer science including neural networks. In modern information society, an idea is considered useful if it can be adapted for computer implementation. This with the help of neural networks is presented on the example of recognition of musical fragments taking into account the parallelism of tonalities. The importance of a methodological approach to education, the components of which are logical and emotional principles, is emphasized.",60106544,Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University,Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.615384615384617,0.13270626432391142,0.38332696715049663,0
95,95,"Triadic closure, homophily, and reciprocation: An empirical investigation of social ties between content providers"," We investigate how the reciprocation benefit for the initiating provider is affected by homophily and triadic closure, the two major mechanisms of tie formation. Specifically, we examine how the increase in subscribers and viewership of the initiating provider’s content attributable to the responding providers’ reciprocation is moderated by common ties and content similarity between the two linked providers. Using panel data on 27,356 YouTube video providers, we specify a switching regression model to estimate the influence of content similarity and common ties on reciprocation impact while correcting for their influence on reciprocation probability. Confirming that reciprocation is generally beneficial for the initiator, we find that although content similarity and common ties increase reciprocation probability, they reduce the reciprocation benefit for the initiator in terms of subscriber growth. We also find a positive interaction effect between content similarity and common ties on reciprocation impact, reducing their individual effects. Combining their respective influence on reciprocation probability and benefit, we further examine how content similarity and common ties affect the expected benefit for the initiator and derive practical implications for content providers and social media platforms.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"['1710', '1705']",30.666666666666668,-0.09437645687645688,0.424009324009324,0
96,96,Evaluating of factor affecting the cloud-based collaboration system based on FAHP,"Cloud computing becomes the important issues in recent years and cloud-based collaborative creation is an emerging service. By storing data in the cloud, the user can access and edit data placed on the cloud, which has become the mainstream of the current trend. But how to choose the right cloud collaboration system has become an important issue. This paper adopts a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) method to synthesize evaluative criteria for the social network platforms and cloud suppliers. First, the relevant literature is discussed and analyzed, and integrated with expert opinions to construct an evaluative framework. Second, through the survey and analysis of the questionnaires, we can understand the user's views on selecting the cloud social network collaboration system, as well as the important items and standards that are valued. Therefore, it also indirectly assists suppliers in improving the development capability of the cloud social collaboration systems in the student population market.",60013395,Yuan Ze University,Chung-Li,Taiwan,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.857142857142858,0.18630952380952384,0.4682539682539682,1
97,97,Assessing the performance of nano lubricant on zinc aluminium alloy,"In the field of tribology, Zinc Aluminium (ZA) alloys have been widely investigated for their superior wear characteristics. They were found to be suitable alternatives for bearing bronzes for the operating conditions of high mechanical load and moderate sliding speeds. Addition of nano-particles in the lubricating oil (base oil) to enhance the characteristics of the base oil is known as nano lubrication. In this study, sliding wear behaviour of ZA27 was investigated under dry, base oil and nano oil lubrication conditions, by varying load, sliding distance and sliding speed. With the base oil as SAE 40, nano graphite was added in two step method which was further used to identify the lubrication regime under different lubrication conditions. From the limited study of single melt samples, the results appear that the wear behaviour of ZA27 alloy improved under nano lubrication conditions with reduction in operating temperature. It could be observed from SEM images that the presence of nano-particles reduced scarring and wear, leading to enhancement in the tribological performance of ZA27 alloy.",60026157,PSG College of Technology,Coimbatore,India,['1706'],24.428571428571427,-0.14996598639455788,0.6676530612244898,1
98,98,The spillover of spotlight: Platform recommendation in the mobile app market," Whereas it is well recognized that the spotlight generated by editor recommendations has a positive effect on the sales of featured products, there is much less understanding in the literature on whether the spotlight influences the sales of other products that are not featured but are related to the featured products and how this externality varies depending on the specific relationship between the featured and nonfeatured products. By leveraging a novel data set collected from the mobile app market, this paper systematically investigates the spillover effect of platform-provided editor recommendations on three groups of related apps: apps by the same developer, apps with similar functionality, and the same apps marketed on a different platform. We distinguish the two mechanisms that potentially drive the externality: exposure spillover and quality endorsement spillover. We find that the overall spillover effect is positive for all three groups, but the underlying mechanisms are different. For the apps by the same developer and the same apps on a different platform, we find a significantly positive spillover of exposure, but the spillover of quality endorsement is weaker across platforms than within the same platform; for the functionally similar apps, the evidence on spillover of exposure is weaker than that for the other two groups, and the spillover of quality endorsement is statistically insignificant. In addition, we also find that the strength of the spillover effect depends on the salient characteristics of the featured apps such as price and user rating.",60116379,W. P.

99,99,When seeing helps believing: The interactive effects of previews and reviews on e-book purchases," Although conceptual and empirical studies on the business ramifications of online reviews abound, little is known about how online previews moderate the effects of online reviews on sales. To cast light on this issue, the current research investigated the interactive effects of exposure to online previews and reviews on individual purchase decisions. We analyzed a unique two-month panel data set on 270,260 sessions that comprise clickstream data on consumers’ exposure to previews and reviews and data on their subsequent purchase behaviors. On the basis of analyses underlain by a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian framework, we found that online previews positively influence individual purchase decisions. More importantly, significant interactions exist between previews and reviews, as evidenced by the decreasing positive effect of previews with increasing review volume and average review rating. In addition, previews can complement reviews when a high variance in the latter renders purchase decisions difficult. We further examined the sequence effect of exposure to previews and reviews and discovered that exposure to previews following the experience of reviews may exert a considerable positive influence on individual purchase decisions. The results from an additional field experiment and a text-based sentiment analysis reinforced the validity of our main findings by mitigating concerns regarding the endogeneity and the accuracy of the review quality, respectively. The findings provide practical implications with regard to the design of optimal strategies for releasing preview information to digital platforms.",60032144,Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology,Yusong,South Korea,"['1710', '1705']",25.88888888888889,0.08083939393939396,0.4433878787878788,0
100,100,Don’t mention it? Analyzing user-generated content signals for early adverse event warnings," In organizations, risk management groups are increasingly interested in working with their information technology teams to develop robust VoC listening platforms. Two key challenges have impeded success. First, prior work has leveraged diverse sets of channels, adverse event types, and modeling methods, resulting in diverging conclusions regarding the viability and efficacy of various user-generated channels and accompanying modeling methods. Second, many existing detection methods rely on “mention models” that have low detection rates, have high false positives, and lack timeliness. Following the information systems design science approach, in this research note we propose a framework for examining key design elements for VoC listening platforms. As part of our framework, we also develop a novel heuristic-based method for detecting adverse events. We evaluate our framework and method on two large test beds each encompassing millions of tweets, forums postings, and search query logs pertaining to hundreds of adverse events related to the pharmaceutical and automotive industries. The results shed light on the interplay between user-generated channels and event types, as well as the potential for more robust event modeling methods that go beyond basic mention models. Our analysis framework reveals that user-generated content channels can facilitate timelier detection of adverse events: on average, two to three years or earlier than commonly used databases. The inclusion of negative sentiment polarity in the models can further reduce false-positive rates. Additionally, we find social media channels provide higher detection rates but lower precision than do search-based signals. The search and web forum channels are timelier than Twitter. The proposed heuristic-based method attains markedly better results than do existing methods—with earlier detection rates of 50%–80% and far fewer false positives across an array of VoC channels and event types. The heuristic method is also well suited for signal fusion across channels. Our note makes several contributions to research. The results also have important implications for various practitioner groups, including regulatory agencies and risk management teams at product manufacturing firms.",60028124,WVU Health Sciences Center Morgantown,Morgantown,United States,"['1710', '1705']",20.3125,0.06992784992784994,0.4695021645021645,0
101,101,Ergonomic Assessment of Multi calibre Individual Weapon System in Virtual reality Platform,"The primary objective of the study was to assess the compatibility of multi calibre individual weapon system (MCIWS) with the shorter, medium and larger individual users of Indian Army. Three dynamic digital human models (DHM) 5thp, 50thp, 95thp army pooled (AP) population were considered to accommodate wide range (more than 90 per cent) of the army population for ergonomic analysis of the weapon system with the help of digital human modelling software Jack. Solid model of MCIWS which was in Parasolid file format X_T (*.x_t) was imported into NX5 (solid model design software) and subsequently converted to JT (*.jt) format. This solid model was later translated into Jack 5.0.1 environment. Standing, squatting and crawling with the weapon were adopted for the study. Angular deviations of important joints, posture prediction using OWAS, and comfort discomfort assessment using Dreyfus 3D method were carried out in the study. The result of the study revealed that the operation in squatting and crawling conditions may increase postural load on neck, shoulder and upper arm. The pistol grip size, shape and contour are acceptable for the taller population. Removal of corrugated gripping surface, reduction of grip diameter and space adjustment for gloves use will be effective for optimal use. The position and size of fore grip seemed suitable for the taller users. Sight system could be accessed by all three user populations.

102,102,A for effort? Using the crowd to identify moral hazard in New York City restaurant hygiene inspections," Although health inspection programs are designed to protect consumers, such inspections typically occur at wide intervals of time, allowing restaurant hygiene to remain unmonitored in the interim periods. Information provided in online reviews may be effectively used in these interim periods to gauge restaurant hygiene. In this paper, we use textual information from online reviews of restaurants to effectively identify cases of hygiene violations in restaurants, even after the restaurants have been inspected and certified, thereby identifying moral hazard. Using a data set of restaurant hygiene inspections in New York City from 2010 through 2016 and the associated set of online reviews for the same set of restaurants from Yelp, we use supervised machine learning techniques to develop a hygiene dictionary specifically crafted to identify hygiene-related concerns. The use of this dictionary and the related word counts in online reviews allows us to identify systematic instances of moral hazard, wherein restaurants with positive hygiene inspection scores are seen to regress in their hygiene maintenance within 90 days of receiving the inspection scores. To the extent that social media provide some visibility into the hygiene practices of restaurants, we argue that the effects of information asymmetry that lead to moral hazard may be partially mitigated in this context. Based on our work, we also provide strategies for how cities and policymakers may design effective restaurant inspection programs, through a combination of traditional inspections and the appropriate use of social media.",60138278,Kelley School of Business,Bloomington,United States,"['1710', '1705']",34.285714285714285,0.13131313131313133,0.43101851851851847,0
103,103,Resonator to laser cavity decoupling interface for chemical oxygen iodine laser,"In the present work, the conventional chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) source has been technologically upgraded and successfully tested after implementation of decoupling interface between laser cavity and resonator. In the technique, anti-reflection coated fused silica windows mounted in suitable mechanical assemblies are placed between resonator mirrors and laser cavity in such a way that the generated laser beam is out coupled through the resonator during the laser operation. The implemented decoupling assemblies isolate the caustic environment produced in low pressure laser cavity from that of resonator mirrors. Thus requirement of using isolation valves and cavity limbs between laser cavity and resonator as in conventional COIL source is eliminated. Such decoupling mechanism therefore effectively reduces the number of associated components as well as overall length of the laser source which in turn further reduces the overall weight of the laser making it suitable for use onto a mobile platform. Moreover the technique provides accrued benefits in terms of reduction in readiness time and checking of optical alignment of the laser source at will in practical operation scenarios.",60069483,Laser Science and Technology Centre India,New Delhi,India,['1706'],29.5,0.12602040816326532,0.45459183673469383,1
104,104,An indicator-free eMBB and URLLC multiplexed downlink system with correlation-based SFBC,"Ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) are new services in the fifth generation mobile communications. One important design issue is how to multiplex eMBB and URLLC traffics. Preemption-based schemes have been proposed to solve the problem. This paper investigates an indicator-free preemption-based method with enhanced reliability. The main idea is to conduct a correlation-based space-frequency block code (CB-SFBC) at transmitter such that the receiver can blindly recognize URLLC data and at the same time improve the diversity. Since CB-SFBC constitutes an equivalent multiple-input and multiple-output system, it can be treated as a coding process and seen as an inner code. Combined with the channel code as an outer code, iterative detection and decoding can be conducted to improve the bit-error-rate performance. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can have low classification error rate and at the same time achieve reliable transmissions.",60074621,MediaTek Inc,Hsinchu,Taiwan,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",18.375,0.020303030303030302,0.3971212121212121,1
105,105,The strategic value of information technology in setting productive capacity," Excess capacity can be used as an economic strategy for entry deterrence by lowering average costs over a greater range of output, and as an operations strategy by providing value through flexibility to manage demand fluctuations and production disturbances. Our primary focus is to study the way that information technology (IT) can contribute to a strategy of holding excess capacity by comparing the relationship between IT capital and capacity with that of non-IT capital and capacity. Using production theory–based empirical analyses, we find that increases in IT capital yield almost fourfold greater expansion in capacity than do increases in non-IT capital. Thus, as both types of capital are constraints on capacity, for a strategy of holding excess capacity IT capital is a more valuable constraint to relax than non-IT capital. In addition, since the late 1990s, IT capital, and to a lesser extent, non-IT capital, has reduced capacity utilization (output/capacity), meaning increasing levels of excess capacity are being held across manufacturing industries and utilities across the economy.",60134867,Lehigh Business,Bethlehem,United States,"['1710', '1705']",33.6,0.19444444444444442,0.4222222222222223,0

Therefore, optical devices for this application should be developed. In this paper, we proposed a design of an efficient GaN-based 1×2 optical power splitter based on self-imaging phenomena for underwater application. The design has been optimised and analysed using the finite difference beam propagation method (FDBPM) at 450nm of wavelength, in which the deep seawater has a low absorption. The optimisation was conducted by investigating the effect of waveguide parameters on the structure. The best length and width of the structure were found to be 450 μm and 10 μm, respectively.

108,108,“Monday effect” on performance variations in supply chain fulfillment: How information technology–enabled procurement may help," Using transaction-level data from the U.S. Government’s General Services Administration, we study three layers of effects: the Monday Effect, the Technology Effect, and the Product Effect. First, we assess whether performance varies across days of the week in supply chain fulfillment, measured by order cycle time, complete orders fulfilled, and short shipment percentage (i.e., the Monday Effect). Furthermore, we assess how information technology (IT), notably an electronic market, can mitigate such variations (i.e., the Technology Effect), and how product characteristics moderate such effects (i.e., the Product Effect). Our findings show that there indeed exist significant, systematic performance variations across days of the week, with Mondays having poorer performance than other days of the week, after controlling for workload and other factors. Further, we find that much of the performance variation can be reduced when an IT-enabled electronic market is adopted. Specifically, the performance gaps in order cycle time, complete orders fulfilled, and short shipment percentage are reduced by 94%, 71%, and 80%, respectively. We further find that IT improves not only the mean level, but also the variance, of operations performance. Finally, we find that the electronic market is most effective at mitigating the Monday Effect for less frequently transacted products, such as products of high value, products that are slow moving, and specialized products with small numbers of buyers. These findings suggest that measures can be taken to reduce fulfillment deficiencies, including using information systems to mitigate variations in operations management, leading, potentially, to operational continuity and higher service levels in the supply chain.",60134867,Lehigh Business,Bethlehem,United States,"['1710', '1705']",25.6,0.0657183908045977,0.5156034482758621,0
109,109,A quaternion-based certifiably optimal solution to the wahba problem with outliers,"The Wahba problem, also known as rotation search, seeks to find the best rotation to align two sets of vector observations given putative correspondences, and is a fundamental routine in many computer vision and robotics applications. This work proposes the first polynomial-time certifiably optimal approach for solving the Wahba problem when a large number of vector observations are outliers. Our first contribution is to formulate the Wahba problem using a Truncated Least Squares (TLS) cost that is insensitive to a large fraction of spurious correspondences. The second contribution is to rewrite the problem using unit quaternions and show that the TLS cost can be framed as a Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP). Since the resulting optimization is still highly non-convex and hard to solve globally, our third contribution is to develop a convex Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxation. We show that while a naive relaxation performs poorly in general, our relaxation is tight even in the presence of large noise and outliers. We validate the proposed algorithm, named QUASAR (QUAternion-based Semidefinite relAxation for Robust alignment), in both synthetic and real datasets showing that the algorithm outperforms RANSAC, robust local optimization techniques, global outlier-removal procedures, and Branch-and-Bound methods. QUASAR is able to compute certifiably optimal solutions (i.e. the relaxation is exact) even in the case when 95% of the correspondences are outliers.",60022195,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,United States,"['1712', '1707']",24.333333333333332,0.12460662525879916,0.35629399585921323,1

An overview of various technologies of artificial intelligence applications in the field of public administration and related fields is given. All of these research directions are particularly relevant to the task of digital technologies (including artificial intelligence) growth to create an efficient and competitive digital economics in Russia. Among the modern intellectual technologies that allow solving the widest range of tasks, an important role plays technologies related to natural language text processing - nonstructured NL-texts are essential segment of data, used for analysis and decision-making tasks (in terms of data volume, of course, video data have a leading position, however, they are usually suitable for solving tactical but not strategic management tasks). The article provides an overview of the existing methods of natural language processing and their practical application to the tasks of public administration. An integrated approach to the natural language processing tools using for solving practical problems in the field of public administration is considered on the example of the ISIDA-T system for extracting information from natural language texts, developed at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center PSI RAS. The system under consideration is distinguished by a modular approach to the pre-processing of unstructured text and the possibility of manual adjustment for a specific extraction task. This technological solution gives the necessary flexibility and ease of use. The system consists of configurable text preprocessing, linguistic analysis, target information retrieval and output of the results in user-friendly form modules. One of the important components of the system is an integrated knowledge resource that allows quickly and efficiently adjust the system to the specifics of the relevant subject area.

111,111,Large online product catalog space indicates high store price: Understanding customers’ overgeneralization and illogical inference," Drawing on consumer inference and signaling theories, the present research suggests this offline association could be overgeneralized to online contexts and lead customers to illogically infer high price based on large interstitial space among products in an online product catalog (i.e., online product catalog space, OPCS). We conducted five experiments to test whether and why OPCS affects customers’ online store price perception and its downstream effect on store evaluation. Our findings indicate that (1) an online store with larger OPCS is perceived to be selling more expensive products (Study 1); (2) the effect of OPCS is due to offline–online overgeneralization rather than online learning, because either a reminder of offline–online differences (Study 2) or sufficient web design knowledge (Study 3) diminishes the effect of OPCS on store price perception, and only people who believe that large offline space is linked with high price show this effect (Study 4); and (3) customers who care more about quality evaluate a store with larger OPCS more positively, whereas customers who care more about price do the opposite (Study 5). These findings contribute to literatures on web design, price perception, consumer inference in e-commerce, and offline–online behavior transfer. We also discuss implications for practice and offer suggestions for future works.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,"['1710', '1705']",41.4,0.13828495034377386,0.4519174942704354,0

Our experience reveals that the three classification algorithms of machine learning and Multilayer perceptron classifiers give poor results on the original dataset due to the problem of unbalanced data. However, oversampling techniques are applied to the dataset to improve these results. The technique we used is an oversampling technique step by step. Therefore, 100% SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) is applied to the minority class at each stage, i.e., the minority class is doubled at each step. We found out that the proposed technique gives better results for all these classification algorithms rather than applying SMOTE directly to balance the dataset and other balanced techniques such as class balance and resample.

113,113,Personalized mobile targeting with user engagement stages: Combining a structural hidden Markov model and field experiment," To date, little is known about how companies can scientifically detect user engagement stages and optimize corresponding personalized-targeting promotion strategies to improve business revenues. This paper proposes a new structural forward-looking hidden Markov model (FHMM) combined with a randomized field experiment on app notification promotions. Our model can recover consumer latent engagement stages by accounting for both the time-varying nature of users’ engagement and their forward-looking consumption behavior. Although app users in most of the engagement stages are likely to become less dynamically engaged, this slippery slope of user engagement can be alleviated by randomized treatments of app promotions. The structural estimates from the FHMM with the field-experimental data also enable us to identify heterogeneity in the treatment effects, specifically in terms of the causal impact of app promotions on continuous app consumption behavior across different hidden engagement stages. Additionally, we simulate and optimize the revenues of different personalized-targeting promotion strategies with the structural estimates. Personalized dynamic engagement-based targeting based on the FHMM can, compared with nonpersonalized mass promotion, generate 101.84% more revenue for the price promotion and 72.46% more revenue for the free-content promotion.

114,114,Gender and age features of media consumption results of the survey of people aged 12-20," Publication rights licensed to ACM.Interest in studying the influence of media on the development of children has persisted for more than 50 years in psychology. Recently, this interest has been intensified by changes in the structure of media consumption related to the preference of internment technologies for traditional media. Analysis of demographic factors of media consumption allowed to determine their influence on the choice of media means and content, type of use, motives of consumption and strategies of development. At the same time, insufficient attention is paid to stylistic peculiarities of media consumption. The aim of the study was to study differences in media consumption styles in groups of different ages and sex. Comparison of the results of the survey of people of different ages (students of 12-14 years, high school students of 15-16 years and students of 17-20 years) and of different sex is the basis of the study. 210 people took part in the survey. Questionnaire by Y.N. Dolgov et al. The ""Individual media consumption style"" was used to collect empirical data. The results of the study confirmed the hypothesis of sex and age differences in the frequency and style of use of different medical facilities. They showed that adolescents prefer to search for information on the internet. The frequency of using television, the internet and journal to search for information has an inverted U-shaped dependence on age. The frequency of access to books and newspapers has a linear dependence on age. Schoolchildren (12-14 years old) have a critical-controlling type of media consumption, high school students (15-16 years old) have an involved critical-controlling type of media consumption, and students (17-22 years old) have an unobstructed critical-controlling type of media consumption. The level of will control and reflexive criticality of media consumption increases when moving from the younger age group to the older age group. The level of content reflection and information search efficiency is higher in men than in women.",60004991,South Ural State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University,"Chelyabinsk Oblast,",Russian Federation,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",19.0,0.096984126984127,0.4018253968253968,0
115,115,Blast wave characteristics and tnt equivalent of improvised explosive device at small-scaled distances,"A significant number of airblast test have been carried out with the purpose to characterise and analyse the properties of improvised explosive device (IED) with non-conventional explosives in terms of knowing the effects on people and/or structures. Small devices with 1.5 kg of explosive, initiated with a detonating cord have been studied. Seven different mixtures have been tested with two types of ammonium nitrate AN (technical and fertilizer) in different forms like prills or powder. In some cases, the ammonium nitrate has been mixed with fuel oil while in others, it has been mixed with aluminum. The TNT equivalent based on pressure, impulse, arrival time, positive phase duration and shock front velocity have been calculated and analysed for each mixture. Comparing the field test data obtained with respect to the representation of the UFC 3-340-02 values, it can be seen that the parameters measured are consistent. The IEDs with fertilizer ammonium nitrate do not detonate with the present charge conditions so the shockwave generated is only due to the detonating cord. When using the technical ammonium nitrate, ANFO can partially detonate and generate a potentially dangerous shockwave. Finally, the IED with AN and aluminum produces a TNT equivalent close to one when the technical AN is used.",60028442,Universidad Politécnica de Madrid,Madrid,Spain,['1706'],23.0,-0.013101604278074863,0.4497326203208556,1

In terms of influence and financial capabilities, these corporations can be compared with the state power, and sometimes even surpass it. The capital owned by TNCs makes it possible to participate in the research and development of new technologies in order to increase the efficiency of their functioning and competitiveness in the market. In the era of digitalization, these corporations invest heavily in the development of modern software solutions and their implementation in the workflow. The transfer of documents into electronic format and conducting most of the daily activity online speaks about the virtualization of processes occurring in TNCs. The activities of these companies either completely go into the sphere of virtual reality, or partly when the company still produces a material product or organizes its delivery from a sender to a consignee. The purpose of this article is to describe the evolution of the electronic document management in TNC and to evaluate possibilities of applicability of the electronic document management of TNC in the everyday activity of the state bodies. The Danish TNC Maersk (the sea line, which is the leader in the field of container shipping) was chosen as an empirical basis for the research. Obtaining insider information about the functioning of these information systems was made possible thanks to a series of interviews with current and former employees of Maersk.

Macedo.Most model checkers provide a useful simulation mode, that allows users to explore the set of possible behaviours by interactively picking at each state which event to execute next. Traditionally this simulation mode cannot take into consideration additional temporal logic constraints, such as arbitrary fairness restrictions, substantially reducing its usability for debugging the modelled system behaviour. Similarly, when a specification is false, even if all its counter-examples combined also form a set of behaviours, most model checkers only present one of them to the user, providing little or no mechanism to explore alternatives. In this paper, we present a simple on-the-fly verification technique to allow the user to explore the behaviours that satisfy an arbitrary temporal logic specification, with an interactive process akin to simulation. This technique enables a unified interface for simulating the modelled system and exploring its counter-examples. The technique is formalised in the framework of state/event linear temporal logic and a proof of concept was implemented in an event-based variant of the Electrum framework.",60020475,Universidade do Minho,Braga,Portugal,['1712'],19.444444444444443,0.0008333333333333285,0.4538095238095237,0

119,119,"Outlier-Robust Spatial Perception: Hardness, General-Purpose Algorithms, and Guarantees","Spatial perception is the backbone of many robotics applications, and spans a broad range of research problems, including localization and mapping, point cloud alignment, and relative pose estimation from camera images. Robust spatial perception is jeopardized by the presence of incorrect data association, and in general, outliers. Although techniques to handle outliers do exist, they can fail in unpredictable manners (e.g., RANSAC, robust estimators), or can have exponential runtime (e.g., branch-and-bound). In this paper, we advance the state of the art in outlier rejection by making three contributions. First, we show that even a simple linear instance of outlier rejection is inapproximable: in the worst-case one cannot design a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that computes an approximate solution efficiently. Our second contribution is to provide the first per-instance sub-optimality bounds to assess the approximation quality of a given outlier rejection outcome. Our third contribution is to propose a simple general-purpose algorithm, named adaptive trimming, to remove outliers. Our algorithm leverages recently-proposed global solvers that are able to solve outlier-free problems, and iteratively removes measurements with large errors. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on three spatial perception problems: 3D registration, two-view geometry, and SLAM.

Higher operating voltages of the battery are achieved by configuration of the cells in series and parallel combinations. The performance of these battery packs are affected by operating temperature and imperfections in manufacturability which causes mismatches in cell impedance, cell potential and state of charge (SOC) imbalance. These performance issues are overcome by cell and battery balancing techniques.

Boundary objects have an important role in promoting knowledge sharing and transfer within and across social boundaries. These objects help individuals to learn from each other and to share their knowledge between and within groups. This study explores the nature of boundary objects as socio-technical constructs that relate to the practice of knowledge management. The researchers used a critical literature review of boundary objects use in the context of the knowledge management landscape. Relevant articles published in English between 2008 and 2018 were retrieved from Web of Science. Analysis of the selected studies indicated that boundary objects contribute significantly to the development of shared understanding, knowledge creation and innovative thinking. These objects play different types of role in supporting knowledge practices within and across organisations. The findings also show that, while performing similar enabling roles in different contexts, the impact and use of different types of boundary objects (i.e., semantic, syntactic, pragmatic and metaphoric) varied significantly. Boundary objects may also help to coordinate interaction in the absence of intended coordination by the actors. It is recommended that, in order to get maximum benefit from the power of boundary objects and to strengthen their role, it is important for an organisation to identify, create and facilitate its use in knowledge management.",60021182,Sun Yat-Sen University,Guangzhou,China,"['1706', '1705']",21.545454545454547,0.14421296296296296,0.5523148148148148,1

A multilevel classification of ICT is proposed. It is concluded that by now the possibilities of traditional ICT, which over the past years have been the engine of economic progress, have exhausted. The latest technologies of the third and fourth industrial revolutions are fundamentally different from traditional ICTs. Their influence is not limited to production and extends to all types of human activity. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the active development of technology will soon change industry, transport, and the economy as a whole. Technologies form a rather vast disordered space that is constantly expanding. At the same time, technological innovations can have both positive and negative effects. Therefore philosophical and methodological understanding, development of methods for analysis and selection of technologies for specific enterprises and organizations is necessary. To comprehend the predicted changes, the necessity of applying interdisciplinary knowledge, and in particular, the theory of open systems, is substantiated. With the combined use of industrial (advanced industrial) and digital technologies, one of the most important regularities of system theory is manifested - the regularity of emergentness, i.e. there is the effect of the appearance of new system properties.

128,128,Measuring the value of recommendation links on product demand," First, the visibility of a product as a recommendation on other products’ pages may increase its exposure and result in a greater number of its page views. Second, visibility of substitute products on the product’s page may cannibalize its own sales while resulting in greater exposure for the substitute products. The net impact of these opposing effects is unclear. We conduct a randomized experiment on a fashion apparel retailer’s website to answer the following questions: (1) what is the causal value of recommendation links from a product to its recommended products in terms of the additional sales for both the product and its recommended products, and (2) how does the value of a product’s recommendation links vary based on its network characteristics, such as its PageRank and the strength of its relationship with neighboring products? We find that as a result of a recommendation, on average, (1) the daily number of product page views increased by 7.5%, and (2) conditional on a product’s page view, its sales decreased by 1.9%, and the sales of its recommended substitutes increased by 9%. On average, recommendation links of a product result in an 11% gain in total sales of the product and its recommended substitutes. However, these gains are not evenly distributed among all products. We find that although the number of page views for a product is positively affected by the number and strength of its incoming links, its sales (its recommended products’ sales) conditional on its page view are negatively (positively) affected by the strength of its outgoing links. We conduct policy simulations to highlight how retailers and producers can apply this knowledge by engineering the recommendation network through sponsored links.",60122769,Warrington College of Business,Gainesville,United States,"['1710', '1705']",35.125,0.0429144385026738,0.44995543672014265,0

130,130,A Bayesian Inference Method Using Monte Carlo Sampling for Estimating the Number of Communities in Bipartite Networks,"Community detection is an important analysis task for complex networks, including bipartite networks, which consist of nodes of two types and edges connecting only nodes of different types. Many community detection methods take the number of communities in the networks as a fixed known quantity; however, it is impossible to give such information in advance in real-world networks. In our paper, we propose a projection-free Bayesian inference method to determine the number of pure-type communities in bipartite networks. This paper makes the following contributions: (1) we present the first principle derivation of a practical method, using the degree-corrected bipartite stochastic block model that is able to deal with networks with broad degree distributions, for estimating the number of pure-type communities of bipartite networks; (2) a prior probability distribution is proposed over the partition of a bipartite network; (3) we design a Monte Carlo algorithm incorporated with our proposed method and prior probability distribution. We give a demonstration of our algorithm on synthetic bipartite networks including an easy case with a homogeneous degree distribution and a difficult case with a heterogeneous degree distribution.

It can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes from a large amount of data, which contains noise and outliers. However, it fails to treat large datasets, outperform when new objects are inserted into the existing database, remove noise points or outliers totally and handle the local density variation that exists within the cluster. So, a good clustering method should allow a significant density modification within the cluster and should learn dynamics and large databases. In this paper, an enhancement of the DBSCAN algorithm is proposed based on incremental clustering called AMF-IDBSCAN which builds incrementally the clusters of different shapes and sizes in large datasets and eliminates the presence of noise and outliers. The proposed AMF-IDBSCAN algorithm uses a canopy clustering algorithm for pre-clustering the data sets to decrease the volume of data, applies an incremental DBSCAN for clustering the data points and Adaptive Median Filtering (AMF) technique for post-clustering to reduce the number of outliers by replacing noises by chosen medians.

133,133,Smart Wound Hydration Monitoring Using Biosensors and Fuzzy Inference System,"Skin wounds either minor or chronic may heal up with different time durations. But, this time duration of healing could not be easily predicted as healing is affected by different factors, e.g., age, nutrition, medication, and surroundings. Despite these factors, wound characteristic also plays a role in the healing process. Wound characteristics include wound size, wound type, internal and external wound environment, body temperature, body oxygenation, wound hydration, and infection. Therefore, monitoring of wound healing also required careful consideration of wound characteristics. Although the healthcare domain contains many applications for detection and monitoring of diseases, the wound care domain requires efficient techniques and sensing systems for the identification of wound biomarkers such as temperature, blood pressure, oxygen, and infection status of wound using biosensors. In the current research, we provide a wound care solution based on a biosensor-based sensing system to measure basic biomarkers, considered as major wound characteristics, i.e., body temperature and body oxygenation, and design a fuzzy inference system to predict their effect on wound hydration, which ultimately recommends necessary actions to boost healing.",60066596,University of Balochistan,Quetta,Pakistan,"['1710', '1705']",25.142857142857142,0.051944444444444446,0.5216666666666667,1

Our goal is to create an ""anti-knowledge base"" that contains fac-tual mistakes.

Prior data sets feature manually gen-erated fact checks of famous misclaims. Instead, we focus on the long tail of factual mistakes made by Web authors, ranging from erroneous sports results to incorrect capitals. We mine mistakes automatically, by an unsupervised ap-proach, from Wikipedia updates that correct factual mis-takes. Identifying such updates (only a small fraction of the total number of updates) is one of the primary challenges. We mine anti-knowledge by a multi-step pipeline. First, we filter out candidate updates via several simple heuris-tics. Next, we correlate Wikipedia updates with other state-ments made on the Web. Using claim occurrence frequen-cies as input to a probabilistic model, we infer the likelihood of corrections via an iterative expectation-maximization ap-proach. Finally, we extract mistakes in the form of subject-predicate-object triples and rank them according to several criteria. Our end result is a data set containing over 110,000 ranked mistakes with a precision of 85% in the top 1% and a precision of over 60% in the top 25%.

135,135,Optimizing databases by learning hidden parameters of solid state drives,"Solid State Drives (SSDs) are complex devices with varying internal implementations, resulting in subtle dierences in behavior between devices. In this paper, we demonstrate how a database engine can be optimized for a particular de-vice by learning its hidden parameters. This can not only improve an application's performance, but also potentially increase the lifetime of the SSD. Our approach for optimiz-ing a database for a given SSD consists of three steps: learn-ing the hidden parameters of the device, proposing rules to analyze the I/O behavior of the database, and optimizing the database by eliminating violations of these rules. We obtain two different characteristics of an SSD, namely the request size profile and the location profile, from which we learn multiple internal parameters. Based on these pa-rameters, we propose rules to analyze the I/O behavior of a database engine. Using these rules, we uncover sub-optimal I/O patterns in SQLite3 and MariaDB when running on our experimental SSDs. Finally, we present three techniques to optimize these database engines: (1) use-hot-locations on SSD-S, which improves the SELECT operation throughput of SQLite3 and MariaDB by 29% and 27% respectively; it also improves the performance of YCSB on MariaDB by 1%-22% depending on the workload mix, (2) write-aligned-stripes on SSD-T, reduces the wear-out caused by SQLite3 write-ahead log (WAL) file by 3.1%, and (3) contain-write-in-flash-page on SSD-T, which reduces the wear-out caused by the MariaDB binary log file by 6.7%.",60032179,University of Wisconsin-Madison,Madison,United States,"['1701', '1700']",29.375,-0.090625,0.38125,1
136,136,On the Possibilities of Encoding Digital Images Using Fractional Fourier Transform,"Abstract: Data encryption is becoming increasingly relevant with the development of digital technologies. A particularly promising direction is the development of encryption methods based on optical transformations. Fractional Fourier Transform is a well-known method of encoding data, especially graphic. However, an assessment of the method’s resistance to unauthorized data decryption has not been carried out until the present moment. In this work we describe a method of encoding images based on a fractional Fourier transform, a method of decoding an image based on a classical Fourier transform, and also estimate the probability of decoding an image using its fractional Fourier transform spectrum.",60033469,Bauman Moscow State Technical University,Moscow,Russian Federation,['1700'],20.4,0.15,0.43571428571428567,1

By applying the Brouwer topological degree theory and inequality analysis techniques, the proof of the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium point is addressed.

138,138,Planting trees for scalable and efficient canonical hub labeling,"Hub labeling is widely used to improve the latency and throughput of Point-to-Point Shortest Distance (PPSD) qu-eries in graph databases. However, constructing hub label-ing, even via the state-of-the-art Pruned Landmark Labeling (PLL) algorithm is computationally intensive. PLL further has a sequential root order label dependency that makes it challenging to parallelize. Hence, the existing parallel ap-proaches are often plagued by label size increase, poor scal-ability and inability to process large weighted graphs. In this paper, we develop novel algorithms that construct the minimal (guaranteed) Canonical Hub Labeling on shared and distributed-memory parallel systems in a scalable and efficient manner. Our key contribution, the PLaNT algo-rithm, provides an embarrassingly parallel approach for la-bel construction that scales well beyond the limits of current practice. Our approach is the first to employ a collaborative label partitioning scheme across multiple nodes of a cluster, for completely in-memory labeling and parallel querying on massive graphs whose labels cannot fit on a single node. On a single node with 72-threads, our shared-memory al-gorithm is up to 47:4x faster than sequential PLL. While our labeling time is comparable to the state-of-the-art shared-memory paraPLL, our label size is 17% smaller on average. PLaNT demonstrates superior parallel scalability. It can process significantly larger graphs and construct labeling or-ders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art distributed paraPLL. Compared to the best shared-memory parallel al-gorithm, it achieves up to 9:5x speedup on a 64 node cluster.",60033252,U.S. Army Research Laboratory,Adelphi,United States,"['1701', '1700']",19.583333333333332,0.08736263736263736,0.38809523809523816,1
139,139,Panorama: A data system for unbounded vocabulary querying over video,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for many computer vision tasks. But us-ing them for video monitoring applications incurs high com-putational cost and inference latency. Thus, recent works have studied how to improve system efficiency. But they largely focus on small ""closed world"" prediction vocabular-ies even though many applications in surveillance security, traffic analytics, etc. have an ever-growing set of target en-tities. We call this the ""unbounded vocabulary"" issue, and it is a key bottleneck for emerging video monitoring appli-cations. We present the first data system for tacking this issue for video querying, Panorama. Our design philosophy is to build a unified and domain-agnostic system that lets application users generalize to unbounded vocabularies in an out-of-the-box manner without tedious manual re-training. To this end, we synthesize and innovate upon an array of techniques from the ML, vision, databases, and multime-dia systems literature to devise a new system architecture. We also present techniques to ensure Panorama has high inference efficiency. Experiments with multiple real-world datasets show that Panorama can achieve between 2x to 20x higher efficiency than baseline approaches on in-vocabulary queries, while still yielding comparable accuracy and also generalizing well to unbounded vocabularies.",60030612,"University of California, San Diego",San Diego,United States,"['1701', '1700']",17.727272727272727,0.07768525592055005,0.40861471861471854,1

141,141,Hopconstrained st simple path enumeration: Towards bridging theory and practice,"Graph is a ubiquitous structure representing entities and their relationships applied in many areas such as social net-works, web graphs, and biological networks. One of the fundamental tasks in graph analytics is to investigate the relations between two vertices (e.g., users, items and enti-ties) such as how a vertex A influences another vertex B, or to what extent A and B are similar to each other, based on the graph topology structure. For this purpose, we study the problem of hop-constrained s-t simple path enumera-tion in this paper, which aims to list all simple paths from a source vertex s to a target vertex t with hop-constraint k. We first propose a polynomial delay algorithm, namely BC-DFS, based on barrier-based pruning technique. Then a join-oriented algorithm, namely JOIN, is designed to further enhance the query response time. On the theoretical side, BC-DFS is a polynomial delay algorithm with O(km) time per output where m is the number of edges in the graph. This time complexity is the same as the best known the-oretical result for the polynomial delay algorithms of this problem. On the practical side, our comprehensive experi-ments on 15 real-life networks demonstrate the superior per-formance of the BC-DFS algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.

Among the most critical components of this problem is the semantic segmentation of images, which provides a classification of objects on the image at the pixel level. One of the applied problems in which semantic segmentation is an essential element of the process of solving them is the information support of the behavior control systems for robotic UAVs. Among the various types of images that are used to solve such problems, it should be noted images obtained by remote sensing of the Earth’s surface. A significant number of variants of neuroarchitectures based on convolutional neural networks have been proposed to solve the semantic image segmentation problem, However, for various reasons, not all of them are suitable for working with images of the Earth’s surface obtained using remote sensing. Neuroarchitectures that are potentially suitable for solving the problem of semantic segmentation of images of the Earth’s surface are identified, a comparative analysis of their effectiveness concerning this task is carried out.",60069256,Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University),Moscow,Russian Federation,['1700'],30.833333333333332,0.159375,0.55,1

Despite the popularity of LSM-trees, they have been criticized for suffering from write stalls and large performance variances due to the inherent mismatch between their fast in-memory writes and slow background I/O operations. In this paper, we use a simple yet effective two-phase experimental approach to evaluate write stalls for various LSM-tree designs.

144,144,Joins on samples: A theoretical guide for practitioners,"Despite decades of research on AQP (approximate query processing), our understanding of sample-based joins has remained limited and, to some extent, even superficial. The common belief in the community is that joining random samples is futile. This belief is largely based on an early result showing that the join of two uniform samples is not an independent sample of the original join, and that it leads to quadratically fewer output tuples. Unfortunately, this early result has little applicability to the key questions practitioners face. For example, the success metric is often the final approximation's accuracy, rather than output cardinality. Moreover, there are many non-uniform sampling strategies that one can employ. Is sampling for joins still futile in all of these settings? If not, what is the best sampling strategy in each case? To the best of our knowledge, there is no formal study answering these questions. This paper aims to improve our understanding of sample-based joins and offer a guideline for practitioners building and using realworld AQP systems. We study limitations of offline samples in approximating join queries: given an offline sampling budget, how well can one approximate the join of two tables? We answer this question for two success metrics: output size and estimator variance. We show that maximizing output size is easy, while there is an information-theoretical lower bound on the lowest variance achievable by any sampling strategy. We then define a hybrid sampling scheme that captures all combinations of stratified, universe, and Bernoulli sampling, and show that this scheme with our optimal parameters achieves the theoretical lower bound within a constant factor. Since computing these optimal parameters requires shuffling statistics across the network, we also propose a decentralized variant in which each node acts autonomously using minimal statistics. We also empirically validate our findings on popular SQL and AQP engines.",60025778,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",Ann Arbor,United States,"['1701', '1700']",23.307692307692307,0.11398809523809524,0.4774267399267399,1

Prior work has proposed many techniques to tailor index structure designs for PM, but they were mostly based on volatile DRAM with simulation due to the lack of real PM hardware. Until today is it unclear how these techniques will actually perform on real PM hardware. With the recent released Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory, for the first time, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of recent persistent index structures. We focus on B+-Tree-based range indexes and carefully choose four representative index structures for evaluation: wBTree, NV-Tree, BzTree and FPTree. These four tree structures cover a wide, representative range of techniques that are essential building blocks of PM-based index structures. For fair comparison, we used an unified programming model for all trees and developed PiBench, a benchmarking framework which targets PM-based indexes.

The quality of the neural network VGG-16 is already satisfactory (top5 accuracy 69%) in the case of 3 bit exponential discretization. The ResNet50 neural network shows top5 accuracy 84% at 4 bits. Other neural networks perform fairly well at 5 bits (top5 accuracies of Xception, Inception-v3, and MobileNet-v2 top5 were 87%, 90%, and 77%, respectively).

149,149,NLNL: Negative learning for noisy labels,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provide excellent performance when used for image classification. The classical method of training CNNs is by labeling images in a supervised manner as in ''input image belongs to this label'' (Positive Learning; PL), which is a fast and accurate method if the labels are assigned correctly to all images. However, if inaccurate labels, or noisy labels, exist, training with PL will provide wrong information, thus severely degrading performance. To address this issue, we start with an indirect learning method called Negative Learning (NL), in which the CNNs are trained using a complementary label as in ''input image does not belong to this complementary label.'' Because the chances of selecting a true label as a complementary label are low, NL decreases the risk of providing incorrect information. Furthermore, to improve convergence, we extend our method by adopting PL selectively, termed as Selective Negative Learning and Positive Learning (SelNLPL). PL is used selectively to train upon expected-to-be-clean data, whose choices become possible as NL progresses, thus resulting in superior performance of filtering out noisy data. With simple semi-supervised training technique, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for noisy data classification, proving the superiority of SelNLPL's noisy data filtering ability.",60032144,Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology,Yusong,South Korea,"['1712', '1707']",28.571428571428573,0.14318181818181822,0.5879560915275202,1

In this paper, we propose a new persistent index called DPTree (Differential Persistent Tree) to address this. DPTree's core idea is to batch multiple writes in DRAM persistently and later merge them into a PM component to amortize persistence overhead. DPTree includes several techniques and algorithms to achieve crash-consistency, reduce PM writes significantly, and maintain excellent read performance. To embrace multi-core processors, we present the design of concurrent DPTree. Our experiments on Intel's Optane DIMMs show that DPTree reduces PM writes by a factor of 1.7x-3x compare to state-of-the-art counterparts.

To demonstrate the potential of this sort of variable resistors it is possible to substitute a complex physical system by a simple mathematical model reproducing the important behavioral characteristics of the actual system. A simple resistor element whose state is defined by a single scalar variable is taken as a model unit. Equations responsible for changes of the state variable are determined. Different functions and parameters that can enter these equations are discussed. Combinations of such elements and conventional electronic components are considered. Measurement methods for variable resistors are investigated.

This results in many ad-hoc stream queries sharing common stream sources. Many of these queries include joins. There are two main limitations that hinder performing ad-hoc stream join processing. The first limitation is missed optimization potential both in stream data processing and query optimization layers. The second limitation is the lack of dynamicity in query execution plans. We present AJoin, a dynamic and incremental ad-hoc stream join framework. AJoin consists of an optimization layer and a stream data processing layer. The optimization layer periodically reoptimizes the query execution plan, performing join reordering and vertical and horizontal scaling at run-time without stopping the execution. The data processing layer implements pipelineparallel join architecture. This layer enables incremental and consistent query processing supporting all the actions triggered by the optimizer.

It can store many data channels, which allows for maximum flexibility in compositing.

Recent studies have proposed many approaches to the POI recommendation. However, the data sparsity and complexity of user check-in behavior still pose big challenges to accurate personalized POI recommendation. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a POI recommendation model named HeteGeoRankRec based on user contextual behavior semantics. First, we employ the meta-path of heterogeneous information network (HIN) to represent the complex semantic relationship among users and POIs. Second, we introduce different context constraints (such as time and weather) into the meta-path, to reveal the fine-grained user behavioral features. Afterwards, we propose a weighted matrix factorization model which considers the influence of geographical distance through the user-POI semantic correlativity matrices generated by multiple meta-paths. Finally, we present a fusion method based on learning to rank, which unifies the recommendation results of different meta-paths as the final user preference. The experiments on the real data collected from Foursquare demonstrate that HeteGeoRankRec has the better performance than the state-of-the-art baselines.",60013614,Hangzhou Dianzi University,Hangzhou,China,"['1712', '1705', '1704', '1702']",20.555555555555557,0.046650717703349276,0.47743221690590115,1

This scheme has better performance than other existing models in a cloud computing environment. TESAC is attracting more and more attentions from industries. Hence, the reliability of TESAC becomes extremely important. In this paper, we apply Communication Sequential Processes (CSP) to model TESAC, as well as their security properties. We mainly focus on its data access mechanism part and formalize it in detail. Moreover, using the model checker Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT), we have verified that the TESAC model cannot assure the security of data with malicious users.

172,172,A Differential Detection Technique for Local Services in DAB Single Frequency Networks,"Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) is a widely used terrestrial audio broadcast transmission system. DAB employs Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing which allows the operation in a Single Frequency Network (SFN). SFNs are beneficial for the distribution of services in large areas, but do not support local services, i.e. different services from different transmitters, without distortion. However, some audio service providers rely on local services. A Local Service Insertion technique for DAB SFNs that supports existing receivers was developed, tested and presented in a field trial in Braunschweig, Germany. The results showed some co-channel interference between local services for existing receivers that use conventional differential detection (CDD). In this paper, we investigate an iterative decision-directed differential detection technique with channel equalization to combat the remaining co-channel interference.

173,173,Unsupervised deep domain adaptation for hyperspectral image classification,"Deep neural networks have been proven to be a promising way for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Their success depends on a premise that source domain (i.e., training) and target domain (i.e., test) samples are identically distributed. However, due to various imaging environments, in practice obvious distribution discrepancy often exists between these two domains, which can dramatically reduce the capacity of the classifier trained in source domain generalizing to target domain. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel deep unsupervised domain adaptation framework for HSI classification, which can simultaneously align the distributions of two domains and learn a classifier in source domain. Firstly, we employ two auto-encoder networks to separately project the samples from two domains into two low-dimensional feature spaces. Then, a multi-level maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss is imposed on the feature space to reduce the distribution discrepancy between two domains. Given the resultant features, a classification subnet is further learned to classify the labeled samples in source domain. Since the classifier is trained based on the domain-invariant features, it can well generalize to the target domain. Experimental results on one benchmark cross-domain HSI datasets prove the superior performance of the proposed method.",60003977,Northwestern Polytechnical University,Xi'an,China,['1706'],21.666666666666668,0.08557692307692306,0.42275641025641025,1

However, the users in mMTC may not have strict synchronization due to signaling reduction and energy efficiency (EE) concern.

In this paper, the problem we study is predicting the Field-of-View(FoV) at the future moment when people are enjoying a dynamic panoramic immersive video. Existing methods either estimate the future viewing area based on the previous trajectory, or predict the FoV based on salient region in video frames. Here, we design a new model to predict the viewing points in future moments. Firstly, we predict a point from the viewer's previous viewing trajectory using LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) network. At the mean time, panoramic video frames are mapped to 6 patches by cube map in advance. The modified VGG-16 network is used for each patch image to perform saliency detection. Then, these 6 salient maps are combined to a single salient map as output. A 3layer convolutional neural network to refined the salient map is utilized. Finally, the salient map of corresponding moment is combined with the predicted point by LSTM input to a two-layer fully connected network to produce the final predicted point.

178,178,Improve Language Modeling for Code Completion Through Learning General Token Repetition of Source Code with Optimized Memory,"In last few years, applying language model to source code is the state-of-the-art method for solving the problem of code completion. However, compared with natural language, code has more obvious repetition characteristics. For example, a variable can be used many times in the following code. Variables in source code have a high chance to be repetitive. Cloned code and templates, also have the property of token repetition. Capturing the token repetition of source code is important. In different projects, variables or types are usually named differently. This means that a model trained in a finite data set will encounter a lot of unseen variables or types in another data set. How to model the semantics of the unseen data and how to predict the unseen data based on the patterns of token repetition are two challenges in code completion. Hence, in this paper, token repetition is modelled as a graph, we propose a novel REP model which is based on deep neural graph network to learn the code toke repetition. The REP model is to identify the edge connections of a graph to recognize the token repetition. For predicting the token repetition of token n, the information of all the previous tokens needs to be considered. We use memory neural network (MNN) to model the semantics of each distinct token to make the framework of REP model more targeted. The experiments indicate that the REP model performs better than LSTM model. Compared with Attention-Pointer network, we also discover that the attention mechanism does not work in all situations. The proposed REP model could achieve similar or slightly better prediction accuracy compared to Attention-Pointer network and consume less training time.

This is achieved by a combination of a ferromagnetic layer that is programmable via spin-orbit torque coupled to an MF layer that also couples into the gate of a traditional FET. Additionally, this device has logic gate-like behavior and can be designed to operate in either AND or OR gate mode.

In this paper, the peak cancellation signal (PCS) is analyzed as a series of parabolic pulse under oversampling constraints. The single pulse can actually clip several adjacent peaks at one time, which inspires us to modify the traditional CF approach in CS recovery scheme. It is known that the performance of the CS is highly related to the sparsity of the recovered signal. The proposed clipping method could dramatically improve the sparsity of the PCS when oversampling is considered and can also reduce the computational complexity to O(N) without FFT and IFFT in the process while the PAPR performance can also improved.

To address this issue a novel internet architecture, Content Centric Network (CCN), has gained attention in the recent years. CCN aims to replace the host-to-host communication structure with a named based content delivery approach. In this context, there is a need to perform video delivery over CCN such as to satisfy users' expectations and a good solution includes adaptive video streaming in CCN. This paper proposes an innovative Buffer-Aware Dynamic Adaptive Streaming solution over CCN (BADASC). The solution leverages the playback-buffer capacity to determine the rate at which the video is delivered to ensure high user satisfaction.",60025059,Dublin City University,Dublin,Ireland,"['1704', '1705', '1706', '1709']",20.0,0.11972027972027972,0.41291375291375293,1

191,191,API Misuse Detection in C Programs: Practice on SSL APIs,"Libraries offer reusable functionality through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with usage constraints such as call conditions or orders. Constraint violations, i.e. API misuses, commonly lead to bugs and security issues. Although researchers have developed various API misuse detectors in the past few decades, recent studies show that API misuse is prevalent in real-world projects, especially for secure socket layer (SSL) certificate validation, which is completely broken in many security-critical applications and libraries. In this paper, we introduce SSLDoc to effectively detect API misuse bugs, specifically for SSL API libraries. The key insight behind SSLDoc is a constraint-directed static analysis technique powered by a domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying API usage constraints. Through studying real-world API misuse bugs, we propose ISpec DSL, which covers majority types of API usage constraints and enables simple but precise specification. Furthermore, we design and implement SSLDoc to automatically parse ISpec into checking targets and employ a static analysis engine to identify potential API misuses and prune false positives with rich semantics. We have instantiated SSLDoc for OpenSSL APIs and applied it to large-scale open-source programs. SSLDoc found 45 previously unknown security-sensitive bugs in OpenSSL implementation and applications in Ubuntu. Up to now, 35 have been confirmed by the corresponding development communities and 27 have been fixed in master branch.",60025278,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1705', '1704', '1702']",19.454545454545453,0.07604166666666667,0.6044642857142858,1

However, the traditional decoding schemes such as CA-SCL and BP algorithms cannot take into account both BER and latency performance. Inspired by the deep learning technology, we propose a scheme that combine convolutional neural network (CNN) with traditional Belief Propagation (BP) decoding. By exploiting noise correlation for channel decoding under colored noise environment, the proposed scheme can obtain a more accurate estimation of channel noise. We simulate the performance of the proposed scheme under BPSK and 4QAM modulation. For QAM modulation, a scheme that extend the conventional real-valued CNN technique to the complex-valued one is given. The results demonstrate that bit error rates (BER) performance can be improved after removing the estimated noise. Compare to the traditional Polar decoding schemes, the proposed scheme has better trade-off between BER and latency performance under colored noise environment.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1704', '1705', '1706', '1709']",19.5,0.10311355311355312,0.45952380952380956,1

195,195,Using Layered Division Multiplexing for Mixed Unicast-Broadcast Service Delivery in 5G,"Point-to-multipoint (PTM) transmission is a key enabler for a wide range of emerging 5G New Radio (NR) applications and use cases. For more efficient use of spectrum, 3GPP is working on a 5G multimedia broadcast multicast service (5G-MBMS) subsystem, aiming at providing effective mixed unicast/multicast/broadcast services on a unified transmission platform. This paper shows that, in many cases, especially high-density small cell deployments, capacity of the current single frequency multi-cell unicast service in the 4G/5G infra-structure is limited by co-channel interference. Using a reduced transmission power to a certain extent will not impact the system performance and throughput. Meanwhile, for broadcast services using single frequency network (SFN), there is no co-channel interference. Signals from adjacent cells are identical, which enhances the reception quality. Slightly reducing the broadcast service SFN emission power will not impact the system quality of service (QoS). This provides a good opportunity to apply layered division multiplexing (LDM), a power-based non-orthogonal multiplexing (P-NOM) technology, to combine broadcast and unicast services in one RF channel by power sharing. This study demonstrates that, in a 5G-MBMS with two-layer P-NOM/LDM, broadcast SFN and multicell unicast services can be efficiently and effectively delivered using the same spectrum resource.",60018714,Communications Research Centre,Ottawa,Canada,"['1704', '1705', '1706', '1709']",21.88888888888889,0.139983164983165,0.474392736892737,1

However, the resource allocation strategy still needs to be further improved in order to allocate resource where unicast or multicast multimedia services are requested simultaneously. Aiming at minimizing power consumption and meeting quality of service (QoS) requirement of users, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning based unicast-multicast resource allocation framework (DRL-CRAF) for it with high energy efficiency. Specifically, we define the state space, action space and reward function for the DRL agent, and formally formulate the resource allocation problem in a multimedia service scenario as a convex optimization problem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework by comparing it with three widely-used baselines via simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can not only meet the requirements of both unicast and multicast users but also effectively reduce 10% transmission energy consumption compared to full connectivity method.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,"['1704', '1705', '1706', '1709']",28.5,0.1281818181818182,0.5081818181818182,1

204,204,Multistep Flow Prediction on Car-Sharing Systems: A Multi-Graph Convolutional Neural Network with Attention Mechanism,"Multistep flow prediction is an essential task for the car-sharing systems. An accurate flow prediction model can help system operators to pre-allocate the cars to meet the demand of users. However, this task is challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal relations among stations. Existing works only considered temporal relations (e.g. using LSTM) or spatial relations (e.g. using CNN) independently. In this paper, we propose an attention to multi-graph convolutional sequence-to-sequence model (AMGC-Seq2Seq), which is a novel deep learning model for multistep flow prediction. The proposed model uses the encoder-decoder architecture, wherein the encoder part, spatial and temporal relations are encoded simultaneously. Then the encoded information is passed to the decoder to generate multistep outputs. In this work, specific multiple graphs are constructed to reflect spatial relations from different aspects, and we model them by using the proposed multi-graph convolution. Attention mechanism is also used to capture the important relations from previous information.

205,205,Novel Efficient Coding Scheme for Data-Rate Limited Journey-Aware Graph-Data Transmission,"How to efficiently transmit graph-data to mobile devices is quite appealing nowadays, especially for autonomous vehicles and positioning systems. When a mobile receiver is set out for a journey, the objective is often to reconstruct topologically-complete subgraphs according to the arrival data in real time. Hence, we dedicate a novel coding scheme to segmenting and arranging the data efficiently from a huge mesh-grid graph. When the data-rate is restricted, through our proposed partitioning and scheduling schemes, mobile receivers can greatly relax the requirement for the number of transmission times to reconstruct topologically-complete subgraphs. To evaluate our proposed techniques, we derive the expected number of transmission times required to reconstruct a subgraph theoretically. Moreover, we define the k-hop completeness to measure the probability of reconstructing a topologically-complete subgraph by any scheme.

210,210,Delivery of High Definition Video Content over Bandwidth Constrained Links in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks,"In order to deal with the fluctuations in available bandwidth that mobile users experience, modern video streaming employs adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms. MPEGDASH enabled clients adapt the bitrate of requested video segments to match as closely as possible the available bandwidth of the wireless link in use. If link conditions are poor or the link is congested, the ABR algorithm will select the lowest available bitrate supported by the video stream. This approach works well for standard video content since there is no restriction on using low bitrates.However, for users wishing to view High Definition (HD) content, there is a lower bound to the bitrate below which they cannot go if the content is to be considered HD. ABR algorithms, forced to maintain HD bitrates over wireless links with constrained bandwidth, experience significant numbers of stalling events. High numbers of stalling events, particularly towards the end of a video, have a serious negative impact on end-user QoE.This paper proposes Adaptive Interface Selection (AIS) to address this issue. AIS leverages the multi-homed nature of modern mobile devices and the segmented nature of video content prepared for DASH-enabled clients to overcome the bandwidth constraints that hobble ABR algorithms. AIS uses multiple wireless interfaces in parallel to download content to maintain the playout buffer level to prevent stalling events. By minimizing the number of stalling events and streaming at HD compatible bitrates end-user QoE is maintained.

In this paper, Layered Division Multiplexing (LDM) is proposed as a new addition to the 5G technology toolbox for achieving significantly enhanced spectral efficiency for the 5G-MBMS to efficiently deliver mixed broadcast and unicast services. A capacity analysis is first conducted to derive the capabilities of an LDM-based 5G-MBMS system to deliver broadcast and unicast services in the different signal layers, under the conditions with severe co-channel interference (CCI). It is shown that using LDM can provide a nearly full-capacity unicast network on top of high-quality broadcast network. The broadcast capacity is mainly determined by the power allocations between the two signal layers. The unicast capacity can be maximized by deliberately operating the system in a CCI-limited mode. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the capacity gain that can be achieved by incorporating LDM in the 5G-MBMS system.

The classical Channel Impulse Response (CIR) and Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) estimation methods based on scattered pilots in OFDM system cannot be directly applied to FBMC/OQAM system, because of the intrinsic pure imaginary interference.

The Correlation Filter-based tracking algorithms are very competitive in terms of accuracy and speed as well as robustness. However, there are still some fields for improvement in the Correlation Filter-based tracking algorithms. First, during the training of the classifier, the background information that can be utilized is very limited. Moreover, the introduction of the cosine window further reduces the background information. These reasons reduce the discriminating power of the classifier. This paper introduces more global background information on the basis of the DCF tracker to improve the discriminating ability of the classifier. Then, in some complex scenes, tracking loss is easy to occur. At this point, the tracker will be treated the background information as the object. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a novel re-detection component. Finally, the current Correlation Filter-based tracking algorithms use the linear interpolation model update method, which cannot adapt to the object changes in time. This paper proposes an adaptive model update strategy to improve the robustness of the tracker.

Streaming services will benefit from 5G networks which promise higher capacity, higher bandwidth and lower latency than current infrastructures. However, the widely employed streaming technologies, such as Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH), require an intrinsic high latency of tens of seconds to enforce the Quality of Experience (QoE). These conditions turn MPEG-DASH unfavourable when compared with a traditional broadcast pipeline for live events in terms of latency. Therefore, improvements on latency of streaming technologies are necessary to deliver live broadcast services over 5G networks. The media industry proposed a Chunked Common Media Application Format (Chunked CMAF) in order to achieve latency under a second. In this paper, we show an implementation of a Chunked CMAF for MPEG-DASH live videos in a real deployment.

Many work focus on network pruning so that they can be effectively deployed. However, most of them require expert knowledge and massive experiments to determine which layers to prune, and how many channels to prune in every single layer. In this paper, we firstly define the importance score of a channel as the product of its L1-norm of weights and scaling factor of batch normalization layer. Then we adopt Lasso regression and fine-grained regularization coefficient to learn sparse scaling factor. By pruning channels with small importance score then retraining, we can get a compact model without significant accuracy drop.

In this context, the mobile network aspires to be a professional tool companion for media production to boost mobility and alleviate costs, space and specialist maintenance of satellite equipment. Transmission of live high quality captured video and graphic design to a cloud or distant studio production infrastructure requires high uplink data rates. However, steady and reliable communications are challenging for the network in disperse, distant and sparse areas. This context may need bonding multiple cellular links to ensure a sufficient Quality of Service (QoS). Video uplink solutions at different network layers can shield from QoS degradation. Communications industry solution for IP bonding consists on having different Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network interfaces with several Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards on the device which transmits the live stream, then having network redundancy. This paper provides an innovative method to dynamically balance the throughput for each concurrently employed network interface in real-time at the live video transmitter. The solution exploits live measurements obtained from the network layer (L3), such as network bandwidth, latency and jitter, which are periodically assessed along the video transmission, and application layer (L7) state, such as the encoding Group Of Pictures (GOP) schema, frame type and framerate, to split the video packets in the different network interfaces.

To identify the SFN signal overlapped area before and after the construction and to check whether the newly added transmitter signals are stably inter-operable to those of the existing transmitters without self-interference, the measurement vehicle should be fixed at a certain measurement point and the transmitter must be turned on and off up-to-date. Hence, as the number of fixed measurement points increases, the transmitters will be exposed to severe stress. Additionally, because the fixed measurement takes a long time to collect enough volume of data, it is not practical to use the old technology as it is. In this study, we propose a novel method to collect the field test data by mobile measurement under the fixed transmitter condition, i.e., turned on or off. Then, the difference between the two results is calculated using data processed by spatial interpolation to determine the SFN signal overlapped area quickly.

This indicates that the proposed method extracts /learns additional features from the difference image using the additional CNN. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed dual CNN with additional input can identify whether the S-UNIWARD steganography was applied to the input image with an accuracy of 80.43%, and can improve the accuracy by approximately 5% when compared with the conventional CNN-based steganalytic method.",60024872,Hanyang University,Seoul,South Korea,"['1704', '1705', '1706', '1709']",28.666666666666668,-0.05616883116883117,0.37110389610389616,1
242,242,Survey of Sea Wave Parameters Classification and Prediction using Machine Learning Models,"Sea has always played a pivotal role in human life. It formulates the weather, provides transportation medium, food, natural resources like oil and gas, and much more. Countless commercial and industrial activities take place on the surface of the sea, thus understanding, classifying and predicting the sea surface wave is a topic of great interest. Many numerical models (NM) have been proposed to model the behavior of sea waves, however, they are complex and costly for site-specific studies. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning (ML) models have recently proved to be an effective solution for site-specific classification, real-time or near-future prediction problems. The ML approach utilizes marine datasets to train, test and validate the model. In this paper, we present a survey of ML studies on the topic of classification and prediction of sea wave parameters.

243,243,On Hit Rate Improving and Energy Consumption Minimizing in Cache-Based Convergent Overlay Network on High-speed Train,"Content caching and energy consumption to protract user device lifetime while bolstering the hit rate when mobility is beyond 300Kmph is challenging. In this paper, we consider a cache-based convergent overlay network comprising cellular base stations and terrestrial broadcast networks as effective means to deliver the services in high-speed train(HST). Most popular contents with high Zipf rank are pushed and cached using broadcast network in user devices and relay system on HST to offload the network traffic and bring user experience upfront leveraging energy. Presence of cache in relay system (RS), users can get the services without delay. However, if user's request for contents are served by cellular network from cloud, they face throughput bottleneck with delay and increased transmission time. This eventually leads increase in user device energy consumption. A popular contents caching scheme with constraints of location, limited storage size and limited power of user device is modeled as closed form expression to maximize users local hit rate with minimal power consumption. we propose an algorithm to cache the contents in user device to minimize total energy consumption of user devices. Moreover, user's content activity behavior is retained to minimize user device's energy by dynamic cache space algorithm. Simulation results justify that the proposed scheme can effectively improve cache hit rate and reduce the power consumption of user devices.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1704', '1705', '1706', '1709']",22.1,0.09512605042016806,0.5495518207282915,1

FeMBMS includes a dedicated broadcast transmission mode on a separate carrier with an Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) Cyclic Prefix (CP) length of $200 \mu \mathrm{s}$, allowing content providers to offer popular services via FeMBMS using existing High Tower, High Power (HTHP) or Medium Tower, Medium Power (MTMP) infrastructure. Synchronization signals and basic signaling information for FeMBMS are periodically transmitted via a Cell Acquisition Subframe (CAS) utilizing the traditional OFDM CP length of only $16.67 \mu \mathrm{s}$. The influence of the short CP length used for transmitting the CAS requires further evaluation.Due to Technische Universität Braunschweig's (TUBS) profound experience with its invention Tower Overlay over LTE-A+, a predecessor of FeMBMS, we were able to implement the world's first FeMBMS transmitter and receiver based on our software defined radio toolkit.After detailing the architecture of the FeMBMS dedicated mode, this paper presents the relevant mechanisms of the TUBS 3GPP Release 14 FeMBMS receiver and evaluates the performance of the FeMBMS dedicated broadcast transmission mode based on a field measurement campaign focusing on the reception performance.",60007902,Technische Universität Braunschweig,Braunschweig,Germany,"['1704', '1705', '1706', '1709']",50.5,0.13145833333333334,0.5258333333333333,1

In this regard, this paper presents the concept, implementation and the components of two of the next generation services so-called: Follow Me Service (FMS) and Multicast Sharing Service (MSS). MSS is a service offered by 5gNB small-cell to UE in indoor environments (e.g. Museum), it enables its clients to use their smart phones in a server-client mode. Server (or host) selects media content from content servers, then casts it to a group of registered clients based on predefined criteria (subscription-based or relative proximity-based). MSS does not rely on UE's smartphone capabilities, rather on network capabilities. MSS can be provisioned by utilising UEs' geolocation information, robust switching mechanism between multiple 5G Radio Access Technology (RAT) and relying on the intelligence of the SDN/NFV Intelligent Home IP Gateway of the Internet of Radio Light (IoRL) project paradigm. Since the infrastructure of the IoRL is not completely ready for deployment, we used Mininet platform to provide performance monitoring with measurements for the service.

The LDM system draws much attention as a next generation broadcast communication system because it can provide 3 to 6 dB higher system gain than a time division multiplexing (TDM) or a frequency division multiplexing (FDM) systems. Many studies have been conducted to improve the transmission capacity and the performance of the two-layer LDM system. In order to achieve the additional transmission capacity, however, it is necessary to study terrestrial broadcasting system adopting LDM system with more than two layers. In this paper, we present the feasibility of a three-layer LDM system by analyzing its spectrum efficiency according to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and comparing it with those of TDM / FDM systems.",60008783,Pusan National University,Busan,South Korea,"['1704', '1705', '1706', '1709']",25.8,0.21666666666666667,0.3666666666666667,1
247,247,A Bi-LSTM and k-NN based method for detecting major time zones of overloaded vehicles,"Overloaded vehicles such as large cargo trucks tend to cause large traffic accidents. Such traffic accidents often bring high mortality rates, including injuries and deaths, and cause fatal damage to road structures such as roads and bridges. Therefore, there is a vicious circle in which a lot of the budgets is spent for accident restoration and road maintenance. It is important to control overloaded vehicles that are around roads in urban areas. However, it often takes a lot of manpower to track down on overloaded vehicles at appropriate interception points during a specific time. Moreover, the drivers tend to avoid interception by bypassing the interception point, while exchanging interception information with each other. In this work, the main bridges in a city are chosen as the interception point. Since installing vehicle-weighing devices on the road surface is expensive and the devices cause frequent faults after the installation, inexpensive general-purpose Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, such as acceleration and gyroscope sensors, are installed on the bridges. First, assuming that the sensing value of the overloaded vehicle is different from the nonoverloaded vehicle, we investigate the difference in the sensed values between the overloaded and nonoverloaded vehicles. Then, based on the hypothesis, we propose a new method to identify prime time zones with overloaded vehicles. Technically, the proposed method comprises two steps. In the first step, we propose a new bridge traffic classification model using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) that automatically classifies time series data to either high or low traffic condition. The Bi-LSTM model has higher accuracy than existing neural network models because it has a symmetric neural network structure, by which input information can be processed in forward and backward directions. In the second step, we propose a new method of automatically identifying top-k time zones with many overloaded vehicles under the high traffic condition. It first uses the k-Nearest Neighbor (NN) algorithm to find the sensing value, most similar to the actual sensing value of the overloaded vehicle, in the high traffic cluster. According to the experimental results, there is a high difference of the sensing values between the overloaded and the nonoverloaded vehicle, through statistical verification. Also, the accuracy of the proposed method in the first step is ~75%, and the top-k time zones in which overloaded vehicles are crowded are identified automatically.",60092867,Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information,Yusong,South Korea,['1701'],22.705882352941178,0.08059433621933622,0.41940836940836934,1
248,248,A Frame Loss Concealment Solution for Spatial Scalable HEVC using Base Layer Motion,"Scalable High Efficiency Video Coding (SHVC) is the most recent video coding solution designed mainly for network adaptive or device adaptive applications. It follows a layered coding structure with one base layer (BL) and one or several enhancement layers (ELs) which can be unequally protected. SHVC is often sensitive to packet loss in unreliable networks, especially in case of ELs. In this paper, we propose a novel error concealment method for the SHVC EL under an assumption that the BL is well protected. First, we recover the partitioning and resample motion data from collocated BL frame. Following, we remove outliers of motion field by a motion vector refinement algorithm. Lastly, we conceal loss frame by using motion compensation and deblocking filtering. Experiments conducted with a rich set of test sequences using the spatial-scalable SHVC have shown that our proposed method significantly outperforms the existing error concealment methods, e.g., BL Reconstruction Up-sampling (RU) and BL-SKIP in both subjective and objective quality assessments.",60071364,Vietnam National University Hanoi,Hanoi,Viet Nam,"['1704', '1705', '1706', '1709']",20.125,0.08047619047619047,0.48202380952380947,1

However, when multiple edges present in blocks, smoothlets become less efficient due to its requirement in further partitioning the blocks. To overcome this problem, multismoothlets have been developed, which could efficiently represent multiple edges with a vector of smoothlets. However, the improvement in terms of the quality of the reconstructed image by the existing implementations of serial and parallel multismoothlets is relatively small. In this paper, we propose a new residual multismoothlets method by iteratively calculating the smoothlets at the original image and multiple levels of residual images to obtain the multismoothlets.

252,252,Boldly going where no prover has gone before,"I argue that the most interesting goal facing researchers in automated reasoning is being able to solve problems that cannot currently be solved by existing tools and methods. This may appear obvious, and is clearly not an original thought, but focusing on this as a primary goal allows us to examine other goals in a new light. Many successful theorem provers employ a portfolio of different methods for solving problems. This changes the landscape on which we perform our research: solving problems that can already be solved may not improve the state of the art and a method that can solve a handful of problems unsolvable by current methods, but generally performs poorly on most problems, can be very useful. We acknowledge that forcing new methods to compete against portfolio solvers can stifle innovation. However, this is only the case when comparisons are made at the level of total problems solved. We propose a movement towards focussing on unique solutions in evaluation and competitions i.e. measuring the potential contribution to a portfolio solver. This state of affairs is particularly prominent in first-order logic, which is undecidable. When reasoning in a decidable logic there can be a focus on optimising a decision procedure and measuring average solving times. But in a setting where solutions are difficult to find, average solving times lose meaning, and whilst improving the efficiency of a technique can move potential solutions within acceptable time limits, in general, complementary strategies may be more successful.",60003771,University of Manchester,Manchester,United Kingdom,['1712'],22.363636363636363,0.1941742424242424,0.6236363636363635,1

The evaluation methodology is based on analyses and link level simulations where the channel model includes AWGN, TDL-A, TDL-C as well as a modified 0dB echo to model different PTM scenarios. The final version of this work aims to provide insightful guidelines on the delay/echo tolerance of the NR PDCCH in terms of mobility and coverage. In this paper, it is observed that under eMBMS scenario, i.e. SFN channel, due to the time domain granularity of pilots distributed inside the PDCCH region, the system can support very high user movement speed/Doppler with an relatively low requirement on the transmit Signal/Carrier-to-Noise Ratio (SNR/CNR).

Only robust mobile services are backhauled to form an SFN in indoor or isolated environments to extend and improve reception Quality of Experience (QoE) for mobile devices. This paper proposes a complete in-band backhaul approach that provides backhaul for both robust mobile and high-data-rate fixed services. The proposed solution uses LDM to carry backhaul data alongside broadcast data intended for reception by the public. The system is fully backward compatible with the ATSC 3.0 Next Gen TV service, causing no degradation on consumer service reception. The scheme can greatly reduce broadcasters' operating costs, while improving service quality - especially for mobile, handheld and indoor reception. In comparison to On-Channel-Repeater (OCR), the proposed system can provide SFN service with flexible emission timing control. The regenerated signals at each transmitter can have high SNR to meet RF spectrum mask requirement and support multi-hop operation. A multi-hop backhaul system can form a mash network for reliability (re-route in case of one transmitter failure), and scalability to follow the population and market growth.

The fitting time is improved by avoiding the Baum-Welch algorithm sensitiveness through the generation of parameters closer to the global maximum likelihood.

As a result of its technical impact, ITU-R considers 5G NR as candidate technology for the International Mobile Telecommunications for 2020 (IMT-2020) evaluation process. To assess 5G NR performance, IMT-2020 defines multiple Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to specific requirements to enable Point-to-Point communications (PTP). IMT-2020 does not consider Point-to-Multipoint (PTM) communications due to the absence of multicast/broadcast capabilities in the current 5G NR standardized solution. Nevertheless, PTM communications are proved to be a key feature for 5G applications in a wide number of vertical sectors as Media Entertainment, Public Warning or Internet of Things. This paper performs an analysis of different IMT-2020 KPIs for 5G NR PTP and extends the evaluation to a PTM perspective.

The existing 4G LTE RA Channel (RACH) lacks the adjustment to the real-time RA traffic and suffers from preamble collision and system congestion caused by the RA request flooding, which will not meet the requirement of ubiquitous and massive connection in 5G. To better improve the system throughput and the RA success probability of RACH in the dense device network, we propose a novel congestion-aware RA mechanism via a two-phase process in which concurrent devices carry out a Real-time Access Intensity Detection (RAID) prior to RA preamble message. In this paper, we develop an analytical model based on stochastic geometry and derive the RA success probability of our proposed model for typical device in single RA slot. The analytical results demonstrate the improvement of our proposed RA mechanism in terms of RA success probability under heavy RA traffic. Furthermore, a large amount of simulations under homogeneous and cluster Poisson Point Process (PPP) is carried out to analyze the performance of the proposed RA mechanism in terms of the system throughput, the RA success probability, the number of retransmission and the RA delay.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1704', '1705', '1706', '1709']",34.833333333333336,0.02893772893772893,0.3340659340659341,1

It employs the Index Modulation (OFDM-IM) technology to enhance the transmission performance of the original LDM system by transmitting extra bits through the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers indices. The proposed system is based on a two-layer, Upper Layer (UL) and Lower Layer (LL), LDM system that serves two independent data services for at least two User Equipment(s) (UE) simultaneously. Besides this, by exploiting the Index Modulation (IM), each UE can receive the extra bits by decoding the subcarriers activation patterns. To map the extra bits to the subcarriers, a simple random codebook is designed in the proposed system based on the concept of OFDM-IM. To proof the availability and reliability of the proposed system, two metrics are chosen to evaluate the system performance, the average Symbol Error Rate (SER) and the transmission rate. In this paper, the architecture of the proposed system is introduced firstly. After that, the average SER of it is analyzed and verified by the Monte Carlo simulation.

However, the latest 5G release does not include the option of transmitting traditional broadcast services. That is why, in this paper, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is presented as a promising candidate in order to boost the implementation of the broadcast/multicast communications within the 5G NR standard. Therefore, a 5G New Radio (NR) fully compliant simulation tool has been developed and NOMA multiplexing schemes have been added, introducing as few modifications as possible.

The infrastructure providers (InP) can divide the physical network into multiple logical networks by NS, and the service provider (SP) can rent these NS instances from the InP to meet their own requirements. Since most multimedia services are usually QoS-aware, such as virtual reality (VR), mobile high-definition video and so on, caching resource can be allocated to different NS instances on demand to reduce the transmission delay and improving the quality of experience (QoE) of end-users. Due to the limited amount of caching resource, the issue about how to efficiently allocate caching resource to increase network revenues and save expenses becomes very critical for InPs. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a delay-constrained caching resource allocation scheme based on Benders decomposition algorithm. It can maximize the revenues of InPs while meeting the service requirement of each network slice.

However, nonuniform point positions and abundant photometry attributes of point cloud (i.e., colors, reflectance and normal directions) result in massive data volume, leading to the heavy overload of transmission. To address this issue, we propose an attribute compression method for static 3D point cloud by taking advantage of 2D video coding technology. The attribute is projected onto 2D images which are generated from cylindrical surface for several times. We require consistent angle for each projection to guarantee the spatial distribution of multiple projected images is similar, then we combine these images into video sequence. 2D video codec is utilized to perform compression.

However, CNNs contain millons of weight parameters and demand huge storage and computation resources, making it hard to deploy on constrained hardwares. To compress the model size and accelerate the deployment speed, many model compression methods have been proposed, including quantization methods that aim to reduce network redundancy by decreasing the representational bits for weights (and activations). However, for low-bit quantization, the inevitable quantization error will lead to significant accuracy degradation and gradient mismatch. In this paper, we propose Scale Estimation Quantization (SEQ). To reduce the quantization error, we analyze the variance of error derived by the quantization process. By exploiting the distributions of network values, we reduce quantization error and estimate the optimal scale parameters for our proposed quantization function. Further more, to deal with gradient mismatch problem in backward propagation, we propose backward approximation. We apply our algorithm on image classification tasks.

285,285,Evaluation of speech quality through recognition and classification of phonemes,"This paper discusses an approach for assessing the quality of speech while undergoing speech rehabilitation. One of the main reasons for speech quality decrease during the surgical treatment of vocal tract diseases is the loss of the vocal tract's parts and the disruption of its symmetry. In particular, one of the most common oncological diseases of the oral cavity is cancer of the tongue. During surgical treatment, a glossectomy is performed, which leads to the need for speech rehabilitation to eliminate the occurring speech defects, leading to a decrease in speech intelligibility. In this paper, we present an automated approach for conducting the speech quality evaluation. The approach relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The main idea of the approach is to train an individual neural network for a patient before having an operation to recognize typical sounding of phonemes for their speech. The neural network will thereby be able to evaluate the similarity between the patient's speech before and after the surgery. The recognition based on the full phoneme set and the recognition by groups of phonemes were considered. The correspondence of assessments obtained through the autorecognition approach with those from the human-based approach is shown. The automated approach is principally applicable to defining boundaries between phonemes.

293,293,A cross-efficiency evaluation method based on evaluation criteria balanced on interval weights,"Cross-efficiency evaluation approaches and common set of weights (CSW) approaches have long been suggested as two of the more important and effective methods for the ranking of decision making units (DMUs) in data envelopment analysis (DEA). The former emphasizes the flexibility of evaluation and its weights are asymmetric, while the latter focuses on the standardization of evaluation and its weights are symmetrical. As a compromise between these two approaches, this paper proposes a cross-efficiency evaluation method that is based on two types of flexible evaluation criteria balanced on interval weights. The evaluation criteria can be regarded as macro policy-or means of regulation-according to the industry's current situation. Unlike current cross-efficiency evaluation methods, which tend to choose the set of weights for peer evaluation based on certain preferences, the cross-efficiency evaluation method based on evaluation criterion determines one set of input and output weights for each DMU. This is done by minimizing the difference between the weights of the DMU and the evaluation criteria, thus ensuring that the cross-evaluation of all DMUs for evaluating peers is as consistent as possible. This method also eliminates prejudice and arbitrariness from peer evaluations. As a result, the proposed cross-efficiency evaluation method not only looks for non-zero weights, but also ranks efficient DMUs completely. The proposed DEA model can be further extended to seek a common set of weights for all DMUs. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applications of the cross-efficiency evaluation method based on evaluation criterion in DEA ranking.",60108793,Fujian Jiangxia University,Fuzhou,China,['1701'],24.7,0.08839285714285713,0.5138392857142857,1
294,294,Improving the accuracy of measurement time intervals of radio reception in the framework of recursive multi-stage Bayesian estimates," All rights reserved.The conditions of increasing the accuracy of digital measurement of repeating signal parameters (increasing the resolution) in measuring radio reception systems by reducing sampling and quantization errors, with a random nature of the change in the measurement conditions (experiment conditions) are analyzed. The method of reducing the errors of digital measurement during random modulation of the phase of the quantizing sequence and conducting multi-stage measurements using recursive optimal estimates from the theory of statistical estimation is analyzed in detail. By analogy with adaptive digital filters, a hypothesis is put forward about the possibility of increasing instrumental accuracy (reducing instrumental errors) in measuring repeated time intervals with random modulation of the initial phase of quantizing pulses and using feedback in the experiment. Thus, the fundamental possibility of creating the fundamental basis of ultra-precise measurements is proved. Similarly, an increase in image sharpness along the X, Y axes is realized, for example, the aperture of the line of receiving sensors and the use of rough (""Boolean"") statistics of the input signal. The approach based on the recursion of measurements due to changes in the conditions of the experiment using the statistical test method (Monte Carlo method) is considered.

On the contrary, optimal order multiple root techniques without derivatives are almost nonexistent. With this as a motivational factor, here we develop a family of optimal fourth-order derivative-free iterative schemes for computing multiple roots. The procedure is based on two steps of which the first is Traub-Steffensen iteration and second is Traub-Steffensen-like iteration. Theoretical results proved for particular cases of the family are symmetric to each other. This feature leads us to prove the general result that shows the fourth-order convergence. Efficacy is demonstrated on different test problems that verifies the efficient convergent nature of the new methods. Moreover, the comparison of performance has proven the presented derivative-free techniques as good competitors to the existing optimal fourth-order methods that use derivatives.",60027373,Technical University of Cluj-Napoca,Cluj-Napoca,Romania,['1701'],16.75,0.12907925407925408,0.29201631701631703,1

The precision computerized numerical-controlled (CNC) cutting process was chosen as an example of this, while tool wear and cutting noise were chosen as the research objectives of CNC cutting quality. The effects of quality optimizing were verified using the depth of cut, cutting speed, feed rate, and tool nose runoff as control parameters and actual cutting on a CNC lathe was performed. Further, the relationships between Fuzzy theory and control parameters as well as quality objectives were used to define semantic rules to perform fuzzy quantification. The quantified output value was introduced into game theory to carry out the multi-quality bargaining game. Through the statistics of strategic probability, the strategy with the highest total probability was selected to obtain the optimum plan of multi-quality and multi-strategy. Under the multi-quality optimum parameter combination, the tool wear and cutting noise, compared to the parameter combination recommended by the cutting manual, was reduced by 23% and 1%, respectively. This research can indeed ameliorate the multi-quality cutting problem.

300,300,2D force constraints in the method of regularized stokeslets,"For many biological systems that involve elastic structures immersed in fluid, small length scales mean that inertial effects are also small, and the fluid obeys the Stokes equations. One way to solve the model equations representing such systems is through the Stokeslet, the fundamental solution to the Stokes equations, and its regularized counterpart, which treats the singularity of the velocity at points where force is applied. In two dimensions, an additional complication arises from Stokes' paradox, whereby the velocity from the Stokeslet is unbounded at infinity when the net hydrodynamic force within the domain is nonzero, invalidating any solutions that use the free space Stokeslet. A straightforward computationally inexpensive method is presented for obtaining valid solutions to the Stokes equations for net nonzero forcing. The approach is based on modifying the boundary conditions of the Stokes equations to impose a mean zero velocity condition on a large curve that surrounds the domain of interest. The corresponding Green's function is derived and used as a fundamental solution in the case of net nonzero forcing. The numerical method is applied to models of cellular motility and blebbing, both of which involve tether forces that are not required to integrate to zero.",60003261,Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences,New York,United States,"['1706', '1703']",28.428571428571427,0.010952380952380955,0.3519047619047619,1
301,301,Management change impact on organizational learning in a business school,"Management is one of the key factors of ensuring and developing the organizational learning ability. The paper analyses the impact of changes in management on organizational learning (hereinafter OL) in a business school of a public university. A fundamental change in the management system was carried out in one public university in Estonia, which replaced the academically democratic elections of the rector, deans and directors with a management model that is typical for business organisations, where the heads at all levels are nominated. To identify the impact of changes in management on the organizational learning, Watkins' and Marsick's learning organization questionnaire (DLOQ) has been used in the research. This research differs methodically from the classical application of DLOQ, which measures the absolute value of organizational learning. Therefore the members of business school were asked to evaluate changes in OL using DLOQ in comparison with the period prior to the reform. For that, the respondents were asked to rate the DLOQ characteristics on a scale from -3 to +3, where a negative score means that the characteristic has become worse after the reform and positive scores imply that they are now better. The results show that changes in the management affects the most the part of OL that is measured by DLOQ dimensions ""foster inquiry and dialogue"" and ""promote collaboration and team learning"". The reasons pointed out are the loss of confidence in the organization as well as sharpening of competition between the employees. The sample size was not adequate to draw reliable conclusions about the whole organization but was sufficient to analyse tendencies. On this basis it is argued that at least in short-term perspective, replacement of academic democracy with the management model typical of a business organization has rather a negative effect on organizational learning.",60068861,Tallinna Tehnikaülikool,Tallinn,Estonia,"['1706', '1705']",26.90909090909091,-0.012599681020733647,0.3988835725677831,1

In this paper, based on the proposed sparse decomposition, a coarse and fine sparse decomposition based on compressed sensing is applied to multipath separation. The applied method uses a linear combination of multiple frequency signals to modulate the source. The measured vector obtained through finite random measurements is subjected to two sparse decompositions–rough separation and detailed positioning, and finally the minimum direct path depth is accurately recovered. Under the premise of the same number of measurements, calculation amount, and storage space, the accuracy of the coarse and fine sparse decomposition based on compressed sensing is improved by nearly an order of magnitude compared to the sparse decomposition without compressed sensing.

For a gradient SDE, the predictions for transition times and paths between its metastable states are done using the potential function. For a nongradient SDE, one needs to decompose its forcing into a gradient of the so-called quasipotential and a rotational component, which cannot be done analytically in general. We propose a methodology for computing the quasipotential for highly dissipative and chaotic systems built on the example of Lorenz'63 with an added stochastic term. It is based on the ordered line integral method, a Dijkstra-like quasipotential solver, and combines 3D computations in whole regions, a dimensional reduction technique, and 2D computations on radial meshes on manifolds or their unions.

308,308,An equivalent damping numerical prediction method for the ring damper used in gears under axial vibration,"In aircraft gas turbine engines, gears in the transmission system are typically cyclic in structure and inevitably encounter large dynamic loads, such as meshing excitation, resulting in high vibration loads in resonance. To prevent gear resonance failure, a ring damper is employed to reduce the resonance response. As relative motion between the gear and the ring damper occurs, vibration loads can be reduced by friction energy dissipation. Moreover, the gears in the aircraft engine are thin-walled and their axial stiffness is much smaller than radial stiffness; thus, it is easier for axial vibration to cause resonance failure. This paper proposes an equivalent damping numerical prediction method for a ring damper under axial vibration, which greatly shortens the calculation time and prevents the forced response analysis of nonlinear structures. Via this method, the influence of ring damper structural parameters on friction damping in gears under axial vibration is investigated. The results indicate that the friction coefficient and mass of the ring damper have a great influence on damping performance.",60021666,Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Nanjing,China,['1701'],24.0,0.06725274725274724,0.45655677655677657,1
309,309,Bubble structures in microphysical objects in 5-D extended space model, All rights reserved.It is considered (1+4)-dimensional Extended Space Model (ESM) as a generalization of the special theory of relativity at a 5-dimensional space. Rotations in extended space correspond to the motion of a particle in gravity field in the embedded four-dimensional space-time. Within the framework of ESM the photons have a nonzero mass in a gravitational field. We study how a rotation in ESM agrees with photon dynamics in the Schwarzschild field. Equations of the critical curve are obtained by the nonzero energy integral variation in accordance with principles of the calculus of variations in mechanics. This method is compared with the Fermat's principle and geodesics principle. Energy and momentum of the particle transferred to the gravity field is defined. The force vector acting on the photon in Schwarzschild space-time is found for the weak gravity and corresponds to photon's gravitational mass equal to the twice mass of a material particle of the same energy. Compliance with the law of conservation of energy as a source of gravity leads to the presence of particles with negative gravitational mass and zero kinematic momentum in the results of the annihilation reaction. Bubble gravitational structures of a type gravastar are considered. Accretion of matter onto compact stars results in their absorption of positive energy from the vacuum and the release negative energy in a free deep space. The particles with negative gravitational mass create there antigravitating vacuum with negative pressure. In the present work a non-conservation of energy in gravitational systems is interpreted by the ESM as the rotation of the energy-momentum vector in 5-dimensional space.

In addition to this, as any business, higher education institutions need to compete and innovate at a time when their performances are measured in detail by their management, students, governments and other external bodies. Staff members in various roles often become familiar with certain routine tasks. Although an institution may rely on these members and others who master a particular activity whenever needed, there is no guarantee that staff members or even teams will stay with the institution. Therefore, it would be necessary to ensure that institutional knowledge does not become synonymous with individual staff members and, therefore, the knowledge is available only when these individuals are present and absent when they are away. This paper looks into how higher education institutions can enhance their knowledge sharing practices by cultivating social capital among its employees. It employs a set of semi-structured interviews to gauge the attitudes of employees of two institutions in Saudi Arabia. This is complemented by a literature survey looking into how social capital theory is adapted by earlier researchers in the area of knowledge sharing. The findings indicate that trust, social interactions, participation and rewards have strong influence in knowledge sharing.",60103612,Jubail University College,Jubail,Saudi Arabia,"['1706', '1705']",23.2,0.1051948051948052,0.38468614718614713,1

321,321,An analytical approach to design camouflage net for microwave absorption,"Microwave absorption has been the key for reduction of radar cross section in the field of stealth technology. In this field, hiding troop details from reconnaissance systems is taken care by enhancing the absorption properties of the material. The demand of masking detectable equipment can be met with the help of a flexible net type structure called camouflage net. Optimising and measuring the absorption of the net, comprising of cloth and coating of the radar absorbing materials over the cloth is a very challenging task. This task is usually being accomplished by using trial and error method, which is a very cumbersome process and leads to tremendous waste of potential, material and manpower. Therefore, an attempt to develop an analytical methodology using the permittivity and permeability of the fabric material, to minimise this limitation, has been presented in this paper by critically analysing simulated results for various composites.

322,322,On comparative efficiency of classification schemes in an ensemble of data sources using averagemutual information," All rights reserved.Given ensemble of data sources and different fusion schemes, an accuracy of multiclass classification of the collections of the source objects is investigated. Using the average mutual information between the datasets of the sources and a set of the classes, a new approach to comparing lower bounds to an error probability in two fusion schemes is developed. The authors consider the WMV (WeightedMajority Vote) scheme which uses a composition of the class decisions on the objects of the individual sources and the GDM (General Dissimilarity Measure) scheme based on a composition ofmetrics in datasets of the sources. For the above fusion schemes, themean values of the average mutual information per one source are estimated. It is proved that the mean in the WMV scheme is less than the similarmean in theGDMscheme. As a corollary, the lower bound to the error probability in theWMV scheme exceeds the similar bound to the error probability in the GDMscheme.

Besides recognition accuracy, strong demands in understanding deep CNNs in the research community motivate developments of tools to dissect pre-trained models to visualize how they make predictions. Recent works further push the interpretability in the network learning stage to learn more meaningful representations. In this work, focusing on a specific area of visual recognition, we report our efforts towards interpretable face recognition. We propose a spatial activation diversity loss to learn more structured face representations.

325,325,About AlGaAs-heterostructures CVC kinetics simulation," All rights reserved.A model of degradation of AlGaAs-heterostructures is presented. The model of dissipative processes was extended to the case of a diffusion-blured aluminum profile. The definition of the Г-Х-mixing operator is generalized for potentials without explicit heterojunctions. The effect of degradation processes on inelastic scattering is taken into account by applying the diffusion equation to the optical potential profile. The self-consistency algorithm was optimized in order to reduce the calculation time. This paper proposes a faster method based on the reduction in the number of calculated integrals for electrons density. A number of test structures were simulated via developed algorithm. The deviation of the calculation results from the experimental data on the curvature of CVC initial section does not exceed 3%. Thus, we can conclude that it is expedient to use the model to calculate the kinetics of heterostructures СVC initial section at elevated temperatures, including within the framework of the task of predicting the GIC and MIC UHF reliability indicators based on multilayer AlGaAs-heterostructures.",60033469,Bauman Moscow State Technical University,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1710', '1708', '1705']",18.555555555555557,0.04,0.34,0

328,328,An evidential prospect theory framework in hesitant fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making,"In numerous real decision-making problems, decision-makers (DMs) encounter situations involving hesitant and probabilistic information simultaneously, and DMs show behavior characteristics of nonrational preferences when they encounter decision-making situations with uncertain information. To address such multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) issues with hesitant and probabilistic information and nonrational preferences, a novel method, called the evidential prospect theory framework, is developed herein based on evidence theory and prospect theory, where the associated coefficients in prospect theory are given on the basis of symmetry principles (i.e., the associated coefficients are common knowledge to DMs). Within the proposed method, belief structures derived from evidence theory apply to the experts' uncertainty about the subjective assessment of criteria for different alternatives. Then, by combining belief structures, the weighted average method is applied to estimate the final aggregated weighting factors of different alternatives. Furthermore, considering the nonrational preferences of DMs, the expected prospect values of different alternatives are derived from the final aggregated weighting factors and prospect theory, which is applied to the ranking order of all alternatives. Finally, a case involving a parabolic trough concentrating solar power plant (PTCSPP) is shown to illustrate the application of the novel method proposed in this paper.

332,332,Modeling vertical fractures using the Schoenberg model on structured grids by grid-characteristic method," All rights reserved.Seismiс prospecting is one of the most popular methods of revealing oil and gas reservoirs in the North seas. Geological media, which contain hydrocarbon layers, often include different heterogeneities, for example, fractures. Many scientific works are devoted to modelling fractures and ways of considering them in various mathematical problems, but the Linear Slip model, known as Schoenberg model of fracture, is still the most actual, though this model was developed at the end of the last century. This model is characterized by the presence of an additional parameter - so called fracture opening parameter, describing fractures. In this work, we present the algorithm of introducing the Schoenberg fracture model in the grid-characteristic method. The fracture is organized to be parallel to the boundaries of the modelling grid. The fracture is situated on the border of the two media with the same characterizing parameters. We describe in detail the algorithm of computing the meanings of velocity and stress tensor in the points on the border with the fracture. In order to verify the correctness of the developed approach to modelling a fracture using the Schoeberg fracture model, we carry out the test calculations of sesmic waves spread in a homogeneous media with the vertical extremely thin fracture, described by the not equal to null normal component of the fracture opening coefficient and with the equal to null tangential component of the fracture opening coefficient.",60105399,Scientific Research Institute for System Analysis,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1710', '1708', '1705']",26.22222222222222,0.1138888888888889,0.3550925925925926,0

Then, based on the calculated field of the Cauchy stress tensor, the possible damaged regions are determined. To highlight the complex shape of the boundaries, multiple contacting separate computational grids are used, between which the contact condition of continuity of speed and traction is used.

Its two major clinical manifestations are deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) which are serious medical conditions but often remain under-diagnosed. Although rate of occurrence of venous thrombosis in men is slightly higher, a number of studies have pointed out that woman poses higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to men at various stages of life. Risk of VTE increases in women's life particularly with use of oral contraceptives, during pregnancy and with exogenous administration of hormones like in post-menopausal hormone therapy. Various reports show that these factors increase risk of DVT and PE by several folds. DVT is considered as an important cause of maternal death in western countries. It is often asymptomatic and its signs and symptoms are similar to those of normal pregnancy. The hormonal changes at various stages of life and less physical activity increase the risk of VTE by blood flow stasis. It is extremely important for women to know the stages of life when they are prone to develop VTE, about its prevention and treatment. Detailed studies on differences in clinical manifestations of VTE between men and women are lacking.

Since belt polishing of blades is a material removal process aimed at reducing surface roughness, it is difficult to achieve both minimum surface roughness and maximum material removal rates. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes an optimization method combining grey correlation analysis (GRA), the Taguchi method, and the response surface method (RSM) for the multiobjective optimization of the process parameters of Ti-6Al-4V aeroengine blade polishing. Meanwhile, the problem of the influence of asymmetry on the polishing process parameters vis-a-vis the optimization goal was solved. Experiments of robotic belt polishing for aeroengine blades were carried out. Based on the results of the principal component analysis, the grey relational grade was established to turn multiobjective optimization into single-objective optimization. A quadratic regression model of Grey correlation grade was developed, and an optimal parameter combination was obtained by the RSM. Finally, verification experiments were performed, and the combination of optimal parameters was obtained as follows: feed rate of 232.09 mm/min, compression amount of 0.08 mm, and belt line speed of 16 m/s, which reduced surface roughness by 6.29% and increased the material removal rate by 16.11%.

The physical chemistry space of the model becomes hyperbolic. The conclusion is made about the need to take into account duality in chemistry. As an illustration serves a model of matter based on Stone duality, which formally represents a pair “substance - properties”. The identity of nonlinear models of the atom and the Universe is shown, which serves as a justification for the periodicity of properties and is consistent with the hyperbolicity of the space of the general theory of relativity. The existence of the “golden section” number as a unit of a new number model is theoretically substantiated.

First, the original image and scrambled watermarking image are processed by wavelet transform, and then the watermarking image processed by the Arnold replacement method is transformed into a meaningless image in the time domain to achieve the effect of encryption. Watermarking is generated by embedding the watermarking image into the important coefficients of the wavelet transform. As an inverse process of watermarking embedding, watermarking extraction needs to be reconstructed by the wavelet transform. Finally, the watermarking is extracted from the inverse scrambled watermarking image, and a new symmetrically encrypted digital watermarking image is obtained. The compression method compresses the embedded digital watermarking image, so that the volume of the compressed watermarking image is greatly reduced when the visual difference is very small. The experimental results show that the watermarking image encrypted by this method not only has good transparency, but also has strong anti-brightness/contrast attack, anti-shearing, and anti-noise performance.

The results of measurements of a temperature dependencys of the resistance (R(T)) shows that when a temperature changes from 80°K to 300°K the resistance changes by about three orders of magnitude. The temperature dependency of the activation energy has a non-Arrhenius character corresponding to the variable range hopping mechanism. An analysis of the dependency of the reduced activation energy versus the natural logarithm of temperature showed that the electric conductivity of graphite nanoflakes corresponds to the Efros-Shklovsky mechanism. Size of graphite nanoflakes was estimated to be ~1.7 nm from the obtained results.,60013628,North-Eastern Federal University,Yakutsk,Russian Federation,"['1710', '1708', '1705']",20.833333333333332,0.05,0.225,0

351,351,Rapid sequence matching for visualization recommender systems," All rights reserved.We present a method to support high quality visualization recommendations for analytic tasks. Visualization converts large datasets into images that allow viewers to efficiently explore, discover, and validate within their data. Visualization recommenders have been proposed that store past sequences: an ordered collection of design choices leading to successful task completion; then match them against an ongoing visualization construction. Based on this matching, a system recommends visualizations that better support the analysts' tasks. A problem of scalability occurs when many sequences are stored. One solution would be to index the sequence database. However, during matching we require sequences that are similar to the partially constructed visualization, not only those that are identical. We implement a locality sensitive hashing algorithm that converts visualizations into set representations, then uses Jaccard similarity to store similar sequence nodes in common hash buckets. This allows us to match partial sequences against a database containing tens of thousands of full sequences in less than 100 ms. Experiments show that our algorithm locates 95% or more of the sequences found in an exhaustive search, producing high-quality visualization recommendations.",60029681,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,Santiago,Chile,['1704'],18.4,0.12691876750700282,0.47560224089635855,0

We then also extend a mouse-based sliding technique to work even if the manipulated object is hidden behind other objects, by making the manipulated object always fully visible through a transparency mask during drag-and-drop positioning.

356,356,A tool for navigating and editing 360 video of social conversations into shareable highlights," All rights reserved.We present ConvCut, an interactive tool for efficiently navigating and editing 360 video of social conversations into shareable video highlights of the memorable moments. ConvCut starts by obtaining a high-quality transcript of the conversation and uses it to segment the video into one 360 video clip per line of speech. It then applies audio, video and text analysis to label the clips with information including the spatial location of faces, the current speaker, the topics of conversation, instances of laughter and extreme changes in volume, facial expression, or gestural motion. The resulting structure lets users navigate the video using keyword search over the transcript and labels to quickly find memorable moments. Users can mark the lines corresponding to these moments and ConvCut edits together the corresponding video clips, automatically choosing a regular field of view (RFOV) framing that emphasizes the speaker of each line. If desired, users can modify the automatic edit to include alternative framings or reactions from others in the group. We demonstrate that with ConvCut, first-time users can easily edit long social conversations (25-60 min) into short highlight videos (0.27-2 min) and share them with others. The resulting highlights include jokes, reactions to pranks, funny stories and interactions with children.",60012708,Stanford University,Palo Alto,United States,['1704'],25.75,0.13630952380952382,0.4745421245421245,0

We use this technique to create highly detailed 3D models of buildings using multi-view reconstruction. Our reconstructed models are great for use in virtual reality (VR) environments since they exhibit good amount of detail that is useful for creating realistic virtual walkthroughs. Creating a good 3D reconstruction with a set of nadir images is difficult since the vertical surfaces of buildings are not captured very well and are therefore not reconstructed accurately. Acquisition of non-nadir images require avoiding obstacles around the structure. Our technique is based on mathematical optimization, and is capable of calculating camera positions and orientations to maximally cover horizontal as well as vertical surface patches while avoiding obstacles around the building. We present a complete pipeline for a mostly automated and robust approach via a camera mounted quadcopter drone.

Given a heterogeneous collection of photos, we organize them into a hierarchical categorization tree (C-tree) based on qualitative analysis using quartets instead of relying on conventional, quantitative image similarity metrics. The main motivation is that in a heterogeneous collection, quantitative distances may become unreliable between dissimilar data and there is unlikely a single metric that is well applicable to all data. Our qualitative analysis utilizes multiple distance measures and applies them where reliable comparisons are possible. Then from the C-tree, we develop an active learning scheme for fine-grained photo scene classification, allowing the selection of representative photos for layout construction which better reflects user intent. Finally, the selected photos are laid out in a comic-like arrangement based on a style template library and layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method is efficient, user-centered, and produces photo albums that are more preferable in comparison with previous approaches.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,['1704'],23.285714285714285,0.0015873015873015886,0.48095238095238096,0

Detection of TB at an early stage reduces mortality. Early stage TB is usually diagnosed using chest x-ray inspection. Since TB and lung cancer mimic each other, it is a challenge for the radiologist to avoid misdiagnosis. This paper presents an ensemble deep learning for TB detection using chest x-ray and Canny edge detected images. This method introduces a new type of feature for the TB detection classifiers, thereby increasing the diversity of errors of the base classifiers. The first set of features were extracted from the original x-ray images, while the second set of features were extracted from the edge detected image. To evaluate the proposed approach, two publicly available datasets were used. The results show that the proposed ensemble method produced the best accuracy of 89.77%, sensitivity of 90.91% and specificity of 88.64%. This indicates that using different types of features extracted from different types of images can improve the detection rate.",60017880,Universiti Malaysia Sabah,Kota Kinabalu,Malaysia,['1702'],16.6,0.08474025974025975,0.43306277056277054,0

364,364,G-Sparks: Glanceable sparklines on smartwatches," All rights reserved.Optimizing the use of a small display while presenting graphic data such as line charts is challenging. To tackle this, we propose G-Sparks, a compact visual representation of glanceable line graphs for smartwatches. Our exploration primarily considered the suitable compression axes for time-series charts. In a first study we examine the optimal line-graph compression approach without compromising perceptual metrics, such as slope or height detections. We evaluated compressions of line segments, the elementary unit of a line graph, along the x-axis, y-axis, and xy-axes. Contrary to intuition, we find that condensing graphs yield more accurate reading of height estimations than non-compressed graphs, but only when these are compressed along the x-axis. Building from this result, we study the effect of an x-axis compression on users' ability to perform ""glanceable"" analytic tasks with actual data. Glanceable tasks include quick perceptual judgements of graph properties. Using bio-metric data (heart rate), we find that shrinking a line graph to the point of representing one data sample per pixel does not compromise legibility. As expected, such type of compression also has the effect of minimizing the needed amount of flicking to interact with such graphs. From our results, we offer guidelines to application designers needing to integrate line charts into smartwatch apps.",60102124,Université Fédérale Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées,Toulouse,France,['1704'],19.181818181818183,0.16018518518518518,0.5231481481481481,0

While extensive effort has been expended designing these algorithms, a comparison between biologically inspired algorithms and naive directional algorithms (travel towards the opponent) has yet to be completed. In this paper, we compare the biological algorithms listed above against a naive control algorithm to assess the effect that these algorithms have on various measures of player experience. The results reveal that the Swarming algorithm, followed closely by Flocking, provide the best gaming experience. However, players noted that the firefly algorithm was most salient.

366,366,Determining the critical thresholds for co-word network based on the theory of percolation transition: A case study in Buddhist studies,"Purpose: One of the chief purposes of bibliometric analysis is to reveal the intellectual structure of a knowledge domain. Yet due to the magnitude and the heterogeneous nature of bibliometric networks, some sorts of filtering procedures are often required to make the resulting network interpretable. A co-word analysis of more than 135,000 scholarly publications on Buddhism was conducted to compare the intellectual structure of Buddhist studies in three language communities, Chinese, English and Japanese, over two periods (1957–1986 and 1987–2016). Six co-word similarity networks were created so social network analysis-based community-detection algorithm can be identified to compare major research themes in different languages and eras. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: A series of filtering procedures was performed to exclude less discriminatory keywords and spurious relationships of a large, cross-language co-word network in Buddhist studies. Chief among the filtering heuristics was a percolation-transition based method to determine the similarity threshold that involves observing the relative decrease of nodes in the giant component with the increasing similarity threshold. Findings: It was found that the topical patterns in the Chinese and Japanese scholarship of Buddhism are alike and observably distinct from that of the English scholarship. Furthermore, a far more drastic changes of research themes were observed in the English literature relative to the Chinese and Japanese literature. Originality/value: The filtering procedures were shown to greatly enhance the modularity values and limited the number of modularity classes; thus, domain expert interpretation is feasible.",60005429,National Taiwan University,Taipei,Taiwan,['1710'],24.3,0.10174162257495592,0.26221340388007053,1

371,371,Storage efficient trajectory clustering and k-NN for robust privacy preserving spatio-temporal databases," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The need to store massive volumes of spatio-temporal data has become a difficult task as GPS capabilities and wireless communication technologies have become prevalent to modern mobile devices. As a result, massive trajectory data are produced, incurring expensive costs for storage, transmission, as well as query processing. A number of algorithms for compressing trajectory data have been proposed in order to overcome these difficulties. These algorithms try to reduce the size of trajectory data, while preserving the quality of the information. In the context of this research work, we focus on both the privacy preservation and storage problem of spatio-temporal databases. To alleviate this issue, we propose an efficient framework for trajectories representation, entitled DUST (DUal-based Spatio-temporal Trajectory), by which a raw trajectory is split into a number of linear sub-trajectories which are subjected to dual transformation that formulates the representatives of each linear component of initial trajectory; thus, the compressed trajectory achieves compression ratio equal to M: 1. To our knowledge, we are the first to study and address k-NN queries on nonlinear moving object trajectories that are represented in dual dimensional space. Additionally, the proposed approach is expected to reinforce the privacy protection of such data. Specifically, even in case that an intruder has access to the dual points of trajectory data and try to reproduce the native points that fit a specific component of the initial trajectory, the identity of the mobile object will remain secure with high probability. In this way, the privacy of the k-anonymity method is reinforced. Through experiments on real spatial datasets, we evaluate the robustness of the new approach and compare it with the one studied in our previous work.",60031155,Panepistimion Patron,Patra,Greece,['1703'],25.636363636363637,0.013101459943565203,0.44900441663599555,0

The study hypothesized that measure of perceptual ability and intelligence is strongly connected through the brain’s attention regulatory mechanism. Therefore, an intelligent classification model should be able to predict and map IQ levels from a dataset associated with varying levels of perception. 115 samples of resting EEG is acquired from the left prefrontal cortex. Sixty-five is used for perceptual ability analysis via CTMT, while another fifty is used in the development of IQ level classification model using SVM. The mean pattern of theta, alpha and beta bands show positive correlation between perceptual ability and IQ level datasets. Meanwhile, the developed SVM model outperforms the previous ANN method; yielding 100% accuracy for training and testing. Subsequently, the classification model successfully predicts and mapped samples from the perceptual ability dataset to its corresponding IQ levels with 98.5% accuracy.

Prior research has also shown that the presence of others at a display can help to mitigate this issue by drawing on people's innate need to belong and social curiosity. This research investigates the potential to replicate this social effect, within the display itself, by drawing on prior interface design approaches that attempt to emulate the “bandwagon-effect”. This effect refers to the tendency for people to mimic the thoughts and behaviors of others. In a four-day field experiment, we deployed three different PLID interfaces featuring bandwagon and call-to-action design concepts. The study found that both the bandwagon and call-to-action designs were effective for engaging passersby, but each influenced different stages of the overall interaction process. We discuss the design implications of our findings, especially the need for socially-safe PLID interactions.",60014171,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Canada,['1704'],22.0,0.1126190476190476,0.41801587301587306,0
378,378,Pitch Pipe: An automatic low-pass filter calibration technique for pointing tasks," All rights reserved.Practitioners use low-pass filters to improve the quality of noisy input device signals whose optimal parameters depend on application-specific precision and latency requirements, as well as situational human and environmental factors. Two common calibration approaches are to learn optimal filter parameters from training data, or interactively tune via trial and error until satisfaction ensues, both having major drawbacks. We propose a novel, automatic custom calibration technique for pointing tasks called Pitch Pipe that in three straightforward steps is able to determine appropriate parameters for a given filter, and is therefore suitable for deployment into unknown environments. Specifically, we estimate noise and user speed, and then select those parameters that best meet system requirements. In a widely deployed Fitts' task user study, we show that Pitch Pipe-tuned filters perform on par with their manually calibrated counterparts, demonstrating that one may use our automatic approach for custom calibration.",60022144,University of Central Florida,Orlando,United States,['1704'],29.8,0.24874999999999997,0.465,0
379,379,VideoWhiz: Non-linear interactive overviews for recipe videos," All rights reserved.With millions of recipe videos increasingly available online, viewers often face the challenge of browsing through these videos and deciding among different styles of recipe demonstrations and instructions. Although state-of-the-art video summarization techniques using linear presentation formats have been shown to be effective in domains such as surveillance, sports or lecture videos, recipe videos are often more complex and may require a different summarization approach. We first investigated how viewers navigate recipe videos and what information they look for when seeking quick overviews of such videos. Based on our findings, we designed VideoWhiz, a novel interactive video summarization tool that provides a non-linear overview design allowing easy access to the key stages or milestones within the recipe and inter-milestone relationships. VideoWhiz uses a combination of computer vision techniques and an annotation workflow to generate these interactive overviews. Our evaluation showed that viewers found VideoWhiz to be effective and useful in providing quick overviews of recipe videos. We discuss the potential for future work to investigate non-linear overviews for other types of instructional videos and to explore more powerful representations for video summarization.",60018491,Simon Fraser University,Burnaby,Canada,['1704'],26.428571428571427,0.20625,0.5633333333333332,0

The goal is to correct the colour cast caused by scene illumination in captured images. In this paper, three user-interactive white balance methods for smartphone cameras are implemented and evaluated. Two methods are commonly used in smartphone cameras: predefined illuminants and temperature slider. The third method, called MarkWhite, is newly introduced into smartphone camera apps. Two user studies evaluated the accuracy and task completion time of MarkWhite and compared it to the existing methods. The first user study revealed that a basic version of MarkWhite is more accurate, slightly faster, and slightly more preferred over the two existing methods. The main user study focused on the full version of MarkWhite, revealing that it is even more accurate than the basic version and better than state-of-the-art industrial white balance methods on the latest smartphone cameras. The collective findings show that MarkWhite is a more accurate and efficient user-interactive white balance method for smartphone cameras, and more preferred by users as well.",60033420,York University,Toronto,Canada,['1704'],19.22222222222222,0.2233201581027668,0.37773386034255607,0

However, the energy management of such systems is very complex. This paper presents a Multi Agent System (MAS) framework applied to manage the flow of energy in a hybrid stand-alone system. The proposed system consists of photovoltaic panels and a wind turbine along with batteries as storage units. The proposed MAS architecture composed of different agents (photovoltaic agent, wind turbine agent, supervisor agent, load controller agent, and storage agent) was developed to manage the flow of energy between the energy resources and the storage units for an isolated house. The agent-approach for HES is explained and the proposed MAS is presented and a simulation model is developed in the java agent development environment (JADE). The system was tested with empty batteries and full batteries and results showed that the system could satisfy the load demand while maintaining the level of the batteries between 30% (minimum discharging rate) and 80% (maximum charging rate).",60012964,"Faculté des Sciences Dhar El Mahraz, Université Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah",Fez,Morocco,['1702'],24.428571428571427,0.06999999999999999,0.47124999999999995,0

383,383,Mapping literacies: Comparing information horizons mapping to measures of information and health literacy,"Purpose: Information literacy and health literacy skills are positively correlated with indicators of quality of life. Assessing these literacies, however, can be daunting – particularly with people that may not respond well to prose-based tools. The purpose of this paper is to use information horizons methodology as a metric that may be reflective of literacies. Design/methodology/approach: Following a power analysis to insure statistical significance, a sample of 161 participants was recruited from a university population and given formal, vetted measures of information literacy and health literacy and then was asked to create an information horizons map within a health-related context. The information horizons maps were evaluated in two different ways. First, the number of sources was counted. Then, the quality of sources was factored in. Multiple regression analysis was applied to both metrics as independent variables with the other assessments as dependent variables. Anker, Reinhart, and Feeley’s model provided the conceptual framework for the study. Findings: Information horizons mapping was not found to have a significant relationship with measures of information literacy. However, there were strong, statistically significant relationships with the measures of health literacy employed in this study. Originality/value: Employing information horizons methodology as a means of providing a metric to assess literacies may be helpful in providing a more complete picture of a person’s abilities. While the current assessment tools have value, this method has the potential to provide important information about the health literacy of people who are not traditionally well represented by prose-based measures.",60024324,University of Iowa,Iowa City,United States,['1710'],19.076923076923077,0.15895721925133688,0.5262032085561498,1
384,384,A frequency analysis and dual hierarchy for efficient rendering of subsurface scattering," All rights reserved.BSSRDFs are commonly used to model subsurface light transport in highly scattering media such as skin and marble. Rendering with BSSRDFs requires an additional spatial integration, which can be significantly more expensive than surface-only rendering with BRDFs. We introduce a novel hierarchical rendering method that can mitigate this additional spatial integration cost. Our method has two key components: a novel frequency analysis of subsurface light transport, and a dual hierarchy over shading and illumination samples. Our frequency analysis predicts the spatial and angular variation of outgoing radiance due to a BSSRDF. We use this analysis to drive adaptive spatial BSSRDF integration with sparse image and illumination samples. We propose the use of a dual-tree structure that allows us to simultaneously traverse a tree of shade points (i.e., pixels) and a tree of object-space illumination samples. Our dual-tree approach generalizes existing single-tree accelerations. Both our frequency analysis and the dual-tree structure are compatible with most existing BSSRDF models, and we show that our method improves rendering times compared to the state of the art method of Jensen and Buhler [18].",60009507,University of Montreal,Montreal,Canada,['1704'],20.22222222222222,0.10350000000000001,0.6014999999999999,0

386,386,3d reconstruction using SFM with sequence images in hadoop," All rights reserved.Reconstructing a 3D structure from 2D images is a hot research topic in computer vision, and many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem in recent years. The structure from motion (SfM) algorithm has the potential to successfully reconstruct geometry from an image set, but the execution of the SfM algorithm on a single computer is only possible with small image sets. If an image set is large, the reconstruction speed decreases and it may even be too slow to complete 3D reconstruction. With the advent of cloud computing platforms, increasingly complex algorithms are being applied via cloud computing. Thus, the algorithm calculation speed for 3D reconstruction may be improved by taking advantage of the computational power of computer clusters. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for realizing 3D reconstruction from sequence images on the Hadoop cluster. Our test results reveal that, using Hadoop, we can achieve fast 3D reconstruction.",60080734,Gachon University,"Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do",South Korea,"['1710', '1706']",22.142857142857142,0.07806122448979591,0.5994897959183675,0

The comparison of the classifiers were based on the accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score as the performance measurement. The results obtained from this study showed that BPMs predicted the fatality of shack attack victim experiment with higher accuracy and precision than the SVMs because BPMs have “average” identifier which can minimize the probabilistic error measure.

390,390,A multi-layer framework for semantic modeling,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to introduce a multi-level framework for semantic modeling (MFSM) based on four signification levels: objects, classes of entities, instances and domains. In addition, four fundamental propositions of the signification process underpin these levels, namely, classification, decomposition, instantiation and contextualization. Design/methodology/approach: The deductive approach guided the design of this modeling framework. The authors empirically validated the MFSM in two ways. First, the authors identified the signification processes used in articles that deal with semantic modeling. The authors then applied the MFSM to model the semantic context of the literature about lean manufacturing, a field of management science. Findings: The MFSM presents a highly consistent approach about the signification process, integrates the semantic modeling literature in a new and comprehensive view; and permits the modeling of any semantic context, thus facilitating the development of knowledge organization systems based on semantic search. Research limitations/implications: The use of MFSM is manual and, thus, requires a considerable effort of the team that decides to model a semantic context. In this paper, the modeling was generated by specialists, and in the future should be applicated to lay users. Practical implications: The MFSM opens up avenues to a new form of classification of documents, as well as for the development of tools based on the semantic search, and to investigate how users do their searches. Social implications: The MFSM can be used to model archives semantically in public or private settings. In future, it can be incorporated to search engines for more efficient searches of users. Originality/value: The MFSM provides a new and comprehensive approach about the elementary levels and activities in the process of signification. In addition, this new framework presents a new form to model semantically any context classifying its objects.",60022764,Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto,Ouro Preto,Brazil,['1710'],20.928571428571427,0.1384469696969697,0.3477746212121212,1

To study how these criteria are developed we built DreamRooms, a room layout prototyping tool with a tight interaction loop between the designer and a generative process that does not encode a priori objective measures of quality. DreamRooms consists of a VR environment wherein the user can set constraints and gradually lower the entropy of a generative process that produces alternative layouts for the user to consider and iterate on.

395,395,Analysis of speed in traditional animation," All rights reserved.Frame-to-frame movement (speed) in animation is commonly described as easing in, easing out, and moving evenly between key-frames. We examined the 2D movement of the salient parts of characters in freehand animation and identified a pattern in speed resembling these descriptions. To identify this pattern we first developed a manual annotation procedure to identify trajectories, their speed related key-frames and their intermediate subsequences in a variety of animations. We found that the speed of a subsequence is related to its average acceleration. Our analysis indicates that a cubic polynomial best approximates the subsequence speed over time and each of the polynomial coefficients are related to average acceleration by four additional polynomials of degree 2, 3, 2 and 3. We develop a polynomial model for speed with least squares polynomial regression and validate our results and annotations with several statistical tests that use 10-fold cross-validation. Our experimental animation interface demonstrates that this relationship has the potential to ease the burden of controlling speed by replacing the control points that otherwise must be specified with a single parameter for average acceleration.",60014171,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Canada,['1704'],26.0,0.02190476190476191,0.3898412698412698,0

405,405,Modulation of synchronous gamma rhythm clusters," All rights reserved.Gamma rhythm plays a key role in a number of cognitive tasks: Working memory, sensory processing and routing of information across neural circuits. In comparison with other (lower frequency) oscillations it is sparser and heterogeneous in space. One way to model such properties of gamma rhythm is to describe it through a neural network consisting of interacting populations of pyramidal cells (excitatory neurons) and interneurons (inhibitory neurons), demonstrating cluster synchronization. The structure of such clusters can be modulated by endogenous neuromodulators: Dopamine, acetylcholine, adrenaline, etc. In this article we consider the reconfiguring of synchronous clusters of pyramidal interneuron gamma rhythm (pyramidal interneuron gamma, PING) due to the variation of the frequency adaptation parameter of pyramidal cells and the strength of excitatory synaptic connections. We have shown that the variation of the frequency adaptation parameter has the strongest impact on the strongest influence on the cluster structure and can lead to either an increase or a decrease of the number of synchronous clusters.",60110693,Université Côte d'Azur,Nice,France,"['1711', '1707', '1702']",27.5,-0.05,0.55,0

407,407,A mixed tactical-operational approach for solving the operating room scheduling problem: A proposed model," All rights reserved.In this paper, we deal with the joint Master Surgery Scheduling (MSS) and Surgery Scheduling Problem (SSP) but to achieve better deployment of resources through extending and generalizing the existing approaches. A concrete model that focuses on resources allocation over the two combined levels is developed. Resources are regarded as decision variables rather than constraints. Resources considered are the Surgical Physicians (SPs) with different experience levels and the beds in the wards. The model takes one step towards real practical life through assuming surgical teams, surgeon and assistant surgeon, as well as surgery complexity. To this aim, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization model for block scheduling is proposed that levels both the SPs’ workload and the bed occupancy while maximizing the Operating Room (OR) utilization. Our problem corresponds to the mixed tactical-operational level since our approach deals simultaneously with both surgeon and patient decision levels, instead of taking them into account in successive phases. The model determines the following three decisions; first, the allocation of the OR blocks to each surgical group, second, the elective surgeries to be performed in each OR block, and finally, the sequence of the surgeries within the OR block. Our approach is generic, so it could be applied to any hospital with minimum adjustments.",60033041,Alexandria University,Alexandria,Egypt,['1700'],23.666666666666668,0.10909090909090909,0.3348484848484849,0
408,408,A method of effectiveness evaluation for satellite observation and data-downlink scheduling considering weather uncertainties," All rights reserved.Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites play an important role in human space activities, and market demands for commercial uses of LEO satellites have been increasing rapidly in recent years. However, satellite resources are very limited, and are much more costly than terrestrial observation resources. In order to utilize the scarce resources efficiently and maximize their commercial benefits, it is important to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the earth observation tasks arranged for a satellite. In this paper, we propose a method of effectiveness evaluation for satellite observation and data-downlink scheduling (SODS) based on the Availability– Dependability–Capacity (ADC) framework, which is designed to evaluate the overall performance of satellites from the perspective of time resource utilization, the success rate of tasks, and profit return.

409,409,Condition-based maintenance policy for leased equipment considering usage rate," All rights reserved.We study a condition based maintenance (CBM) for a leased equipment. Many companies are willing to lease rather than own the equipment as it does not require an initial investment, and saves significantly maintenance cost. To keep competitive, the lessor offers a lease contract which ensures high performance of the leased equipment. An effective maintenance policy is needed to ensure a high performance (e.g. availability) of the equipment. The condition based maintenance (CBM) policy is used in order to reduce failures and unnecessary maintenance actions, and hence results in high availability and minimum maintenance cost. We propose a condition based maintenance (CBM) policy with periodic inspections, in order to control the level of degradation. The degradation process is considered to be influenced by age, usage and operating condition where the equipment is operated, and it is modelled by a Gamma process with the shape parameter being a function of age and usage. As the lessor ensures a high availability, then the lessor incurs a penalty cost if the downtime exceeds a threshold value. We study the lease contract from the lessor’s viewpoint, and find the optimal maintenance policy (i.e. an inspection interval and a preventive maintenance threshold) minimizing the total costs while keeping to meet the availability target. We present numerical examples for illustrating the optimal inspection interval and the preventive maintenance threshold minimizing the expected total costs for the lessor for a given availability target.",60105015,Universitas Langlangbuana,Bandung,Indonesia,['1700'],19.916666666666668,0.16031250000000002,0.5553125,0

From the point of view of wave load, taking a certain type of ship as an example, 3D time-domain nonlinear hydroelastic theory is used to calculate the wave loads of warship under four parameters such as wave period, wave height, wave direction angle and speed. Sensitivity analysis method is introduced to quantitatively evaluate the effects of interactive and non-interactive parameters on wave loads. Suggestions are put forward to ensure the safety of warships. The results show that wave height has the greatest effect on wave loads compared with other parameters; there is a significant positive correlation between wave height and speed; the wave direction angle of 120 degrees is a special condition, at this time, the wave loads vary slightly with the speed and there is some negative correlation between wave height and speed.",60069736,Naval University of Engineering,Wuhan,China,['1700'],30.8,0.111002886002886,0.525414862914863,0
411,411,Who would buy frozen food and why they buy?-an empirical study in shizuoka-," All rights reserved.In recent years, frozen food is more and more popular than before because of the change of household condition. According to the survey of Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the amount of dual income household is increasing, and young people have less time to cook by themselves. And the consumption of frozen food in the household budget increases every year since 2018. There are many researches pay attention to frozen food but few of them concerning consumers awareness about frozen food. In view of this, in this paper, several hypotheses are proposed and a questionnaire investigation for consumers’ awareness for frozen food is conducted at Shizuoka Prefecture in Japan and hypothesis testing is conducted. The results of the data analysis show that in five cases out of ten, the null hypotheses are rejected, and 5 hypotheses are insisted clearly. The main results are as follows. Those who do not eat the frozen food so often use them as a lunch box at outing, office or school. Female want the new products with low in calories while male want the new products with high in calories. Those who like to eat instant food often eat the frozen food. This suggests that the instant food and the frozen food may be the same position for those people. Generally, to save time, busy people are apt to buy frozen food and seek the food which is simple to cook. During the interview, we often heard that they have wanted to select other higher ranked brand when they buy next time.

420,420,Adaptive ANN based differential protective relay for reliable power transformer protection operation during energisation," All rights reserved.Power transformer is the most expensive equipment in electrical power system that needs continuous monitoring and fast protection response. Differential relay is usually used in power transformer protection scheme. This protection compares the difference of currents between transformer primary and secondary sides, with which a tripping signal to the circuit breaker is asserted. However, when power transformers are energized, the magnetizing inrush current is present and due to its high magnitude, the relay mal-operates. To prevent mal-operation, methods revolving around the fact that the relay should be able to discriminate between the magnetizing inrush current and the fault current must be studied. This paper presents an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based differential relay that is designed to enable the differential relay to correct its mal-operation during energization by training the ANN and testing it with harmonic current as the restraining element. The MATLAB software is used to implement and evaluate the proposed differential relay. It is shown that the ANN based differential relay is indeed an adaptive relay when it is appropriately trained using the Network Fitting Tool. The improved differential relay models also include a reset part which enables automatic reset of the relays. Using the techniques of 2nd harmonic restraint and ANN to design a differential relay thus illustrates that the latter can successfully differentiate between magnetizing inrush and internal fault currents. With the new adaptive ANN-based differential relay, there is no mal-operation of the relay during energization. The ANN based differential relay shows better performance in terms of its ability to differentiate fault against energization current. Amazingly, the response time, when there is an internal fault, is 1 ms compared to 4.5 ms of the conventional 2nd harmonic restraint based relay.",60025577,Universiti Putra Malaysia,Serdang,Malaysia,['1702'],22.076923076923077,0.10101808905380336,0.4125602968460112,0
421,421,A framework for evaluating branch predictors using multiple performance parameters,"Selecting a branch predictor for a program for prediction is a challenging task. The performance of a branch predictor is measured not only by the prediction accuracy - parameters like predictor size, energy expenditure, latency of execution play a key role in predictor selection. For a specific program, a predictor which provides the best results based on one of these parameters, may not be the best when some other parameter is considered. The task to select the best predictor considering all the different parameters, is therefore, a non-trivial one, and is considered one of the foremost challenges. In this paper, we propose a framework to systematically address this important challenge using the concept of aggregation and unification. For a given program, our framework considers the performance of the different predictors, with respect to the different parameters, and makes a predictor selection based on all of them. On one side, our framework can be an important aid for deciding on the best predictor to use at runtime. On the other side, the proposal of new predictor can be systematically evaluated and placed in purview of existing ones, considering the parameters of choice.

438,438,Joint replenishment plan for slow moving parts with substitution," All rights reserved.We studied the problem of optimal joint replenishment and inventory plan for spare parts with a slow moving demand pattern for a telecommunication company. The demand function of slow moving parts is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. A satisfaction rate is provided for each spare part to determine the re-order point (ROP), which indicates the safe level of stock. Once the current stock drops below this point, this spare part will be replenished based on the ROP and the current demand. This is the traditional way of replenishment for each spare part, but with substitution relationship between spare parts it is believed that a joint replenishment model will help to reduce the stock holding cost and replenishment cost. We proposed to solve this problem in two phases. Under real life situation, the substitution relationships between spare parts are quite complicated, for example, one spare part may be able to replace many different spare parts, and the substitution could be one way or two way. In some cases, a set of spare parts grouped together could replace another spare parts. The first phase of solving this problem is to adopt a directed graph representations of the substitution problems. All spares parts that are connected can be found by a graph algorithm, and the problem is divided into many small sub problem as the joint replenishment plan only needs to consider each connected graph. The second phase of the problem is to solve each sub problem by determining the optimal demand shifted among those connected spare parts due to substitution. We adopted a differential evolution algorithm to solve the second phase. The solution framework is tested through numerical experiments with real life data. To compare the results, the costs of the joint replenishment plan created by spare parts substitution are compared with the traditional approach currently applying by the company. By applying joint replenishment techniques, reduction in stock holding cost and replenishment cost are observed.",60092530,"Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.",Shenzhen,China,['1700'],21.8,0.05595238095238094,0.473015873015873,0
439,439,Online PHM system for bearings based on time-frequency analysis and CNN transfer learning," All rights reserved.Bearings are important transmission components for rotating machinery, and their remaining life prediction plays a crucial role in equipment maintenance decisions. In this paper, the gearbox of crane running online is the research target. Because the bearing accounts for a high proportion of the historical machine failure, taking the bearing as an example to detail the overall framework and algorithm details for monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis. The current bottlenecks in bearing failure prediction are: (1) The bearing health status and failure mode are uncertain during operation. (2) The value density of data is low and cannot support the training of neural networks. (3) Lack of accurate failure data for economic and security reasons. (4) Compared with the run-to-failure experiment, the bearings of different types of gearboxes are different, and the working conditions are quite different. Even for the same type of bearing, according to a large number of data, the life of rolling bearings is presented as a discrete distribution, and the prediction model (curve) is difficult to transfer directly. Therefore, the identification of the degraded state and early failure of in-service bearings is significant for accurately predicting the remaining life. In contrast, bearing datasets obtained by these run-to-failure experiments can accurately obtain the monitoring data of the bearing from health to damage throughout the life cycle, to facilitate the division of the recession phase, training the classifier. This paper proposes a universal transfer learning analysis scheme for online PHM system of rotating machinery: Time-frequency analysis is used to evaluate the performance degradation of the bearing state, determine the time of the early failure, and divide the health and damage data. Transfer the CNN classifier originally trained by the experimental data to online data, which helps the abnormal detection of the online equipment, and finally the life prediction is completed by the piecewise prediction model.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,['1700'],25.666666666666668,0.005446428571428572,0.4849553571428572,0

447,447,Learning trajectory dependencies for human motion prediction,"Human motion prediction, i.e., forecasting future body poses given observed pose sequence, has typically been tackled with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, as evidenced by prior work, the resulted RNN models suffer from prediction errors accumulation, leading to undesired discontinuities in motion prediction. In this paper, we propose a simple feed-forward deep network for motion prediction, which takes into account both temporal smoothness and spatial dependencies among human body joints. In this context, we then propose to encode temporal information by working in trajectory space, instead of the traditionally-used pose space. This alleviates us from manually defining the range of temporal dependencies (or temporal convolutional filter size, as done in previous work). Moreover, spatial dependency of human pose is encoded by treating a human pose as a generic graph (rather than a human skeletal kinematic tree) formed by links between every pair of body joints. Instead of using a pre-defined graph structure, we design a new graph convolutional network to learn graph connectivity automatically. This allows the network to capture long range dependencies beyond that of human kinematic tree. We evaluate our approach on several standard benchmark datasets for motion prediction, including Human3.6M, the CMU motion capture dataset and 3DPW. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state of the art performance, and is applicable to both angle-based and position-based pose representations.

449,449,An improved deeplearning method with retinanet and transfer learning for fabric defects detection," All rights reserved.In fabric defects detection, it is vital to locate and classify the fabric defects with high accuracy. Deep learning method like Retinanet achieved fast detection speed and high detection accuracy in object detection tasks. But in fabric defects field, the various scales of defects including the ‘through-type’ defects, substantialize the complexity of the recognition. Meanwhile, the sample number of fabric defects dataset is much smaller compared with ImageNet, the lack of training samples will result low detection accuracy. In this paper, an improved detector RetinaNet with feature-model-based transfer learning (IDR-FMTL) combination method is proposed for automatic detection of fabric defects, focusing on 12 categories defects especially two ‘through-type’ defects:1) Weft Missing 2) Warp Missing. IDR-FMTL method replaces the original backbone of RetinaNet with VGG16 for a faster detection speed and improved the Retinanet by redesigning the scales of anchor boxes, and uses the feature-model-based transfer learning approach for a higher detection accuracy. To train the model, we do experiments by freezing, fine-tuning, retraining different layers of the improved Retinanet and finally get the best transfer learning model according to the detection results. Experiments with fabric defects dataset show that the detection time is reduced by 27ms from 221ms to 194ms, and the mean average detection accuracy is improved by 6.6% from 76.97% to 83.51%, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed fabric defects detection method.",60010953,Donghua University,Shanghai,China,['1700'],28.5,0.08855263157894737,0.47986842105263156,0

451,451,Human motion prediction via spatio-temporal inpainting,"We propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to forecast 3D human motion given a sequence of past 3D skeleton poses. While recent GANs have shown promising results, they can only forecast plausible motion over relatively short periods of time (few hundred milliseconds) and typically ignore the absolute position of the skeleton w.r.t. the camera. Our scheme provides long term predictions (two seconds or more) for both the body pose and its absolute position. Our approach builds upon three main contributions. First, we represent the data using a spatio-temporal tensor of 3D skeleton coordinates which allows formulating the prediction problem as an inpainting one, for which GANs work particularly well. Secondly, we design an architecture to learn the joint distribution of body poses and global motion, capable to hypothesize large chunks of the input 3D tensor with missing data. And finally, we argue that the L2 metric, considered so far by most approaches, fails to capture the actual distribution of long-term human motion. We propose two alternative metrics, based on the distribution of frequencies, that are able to capture more realistic motion patterns.

452,452,A multi-stage cooperative co-evolution method for large scale global optimization," All rights reserved.Cooperative co-evolution (CC) is one of the effective frameworks to tackle large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problems. For CC framework, problem decomposition is an essential part which can decompose a problem into several smaller sub-problems. However, most decomposition methods just conduct a rough decomposition and some sub-problems still have high dimensionality. Furthermore, CC framework generally has to combine other techniques not just decomposition methods in order to improve efficiency. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage CC method (MSCC) which is divided into three stages: a preliminary stage, a decomposition stage and an optimization stage. First, a self-adaptive scan (SAS) method is used to scan each decision variable and get a good starting point. Second, MSCC method uses a relative contribution-based decomposition (RCD) method to further decompose high dimensional sub-problems. Third, a cumulative resource allocation (CRA) method is performed to self-adaptively select sub-components for optimizing. Finally, we conduct experiments on CEC’2013 LSGO problems to evaluate the efficacy of the MSCC method.

455,455,Robust optimization for the intermodal transportation network redesign problem under uncertainties and disruptions," All rights reserved.With the rapid growth of international trade and containerized transportation, the existing intermodal transportation networks have hit their bottlenecks: physical size, facility capacities and service ability of the network are no longer capable of regional transportation tasks. Thus it is critical for network planners to redesign a pre-existed network by opening new terminals, expanding the existing facilities and re-assigning cargo flows. Therefore, this paper focuses on the intermodal transportation network redesign (ITNR) problem, in which uncertainty of parameters and system disruptions are considered. We firstly define the intermodal transportation network redesign problem under uncertainties and disruptions (ITNR-UD), and then the nominal model without considering uncertainties is proposed. Secondly, to capture the features of uncertain parameters, the uncertainty set is introduced to formulate the robust model for the ITNR-UD problem. Finally, after we transformed the robust model into an equivalent model to make it computationally tractable, the numerical experiments are given to verify the validity of the models. The study provides both theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretical contribution includes the enriching of the literature about intermodal transportation network design problem, which firstly applies uncertainty sets based robust optimization to deal with uncertainties in the ITNR problem.

456,456,A study of pricing and upgrading policies for multi-generations products with a trade-in program," All rights reserved.This research explores the pricing strategies of two generations for durable products in a simple supply chain. In recent years, most of companies have often launched new generation products by upgrading the design of their original ones in the market. The upgrading level of quality is an attractive factor to purchase/replace the new/original-generation ones. Meanwhile, the price of the original generations is reduced for sale. Furthermore, companies offer a trade-in rebate to promote sales of the new-generation products and customer loyalties; that is, customers can sell their used products as part payment for buying new generation products. When products are durable goods, the used will compete with the new ones, so that all of the new, original and used products coexist in the market.

457,457,Dynamic assessment of sustainable manufacturing capability for industrial cloud robotics based on correlation model," All rights reserved.For industrial cloud robotics (ICRs), sustainable manufacturing capability assessment is an effective way to know the performance of ICRs, and is also the basis of the ICRs resources optimization. However, the overall manufacturing capability of the ICRs composite service will be affected by the correlations relationships among ICRs, including business entity correlation, composite structure correlation and data correlation. For the reason that the manufacturing capability correlation among tasks-oriented ICRs is neglected in previous research, this paper proposes a dynamic assessment method of sustainable manufacturing capability for ICRs based on the correlation model. First, the extensible multi-dimensional indicators are presented considering the diversity of ICRs. Then, the service correlation among ICRs services is described, at the same time, the data correlation is mined from the actual processing data. On this basis, a dynamic evaluation model is established. Moreover, in order to consider the interaction relationships of indicators and enhance the objectivity of the assessment method, an improved analytic network process (ANP) method is used to determine the weight. Finally, a case study is implemented, which shows the reasonability and stability of the proposed method in evaluating the sustainable manufacturing capability of ICRs.",60022414,Wuhan University of Technology,Wuhan,China,['1700'],24.25,0.07592592592592592,0.3175925925925926,0

When manufacturing a product, there machining and assembling errors are inevitable. Therefore inspection process is important to check if the errors are within a tolerance specified in design drawing. For mass-produced products, however, checking each one leads to high cost. Usually, sampling inspection is performed in mass productions. In the inspection process for mass-produced products, statistical values of sampling, i.e. means, standard deviation and ranges are monitored. The result can also be used to estimate capability of the process. The estimated values are well known as process performance index or process capability index. In our previous study, a new quality design method using process capability indices was proposed. However, uncertainties of average and standard deviation were not considered in the method.

With the development of researches, VRP has several common variants that involve different constraints. This paper proposes a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on fast convergence hybrid sampling strategy (MOEA-FCHSS) to solve multi-type vehicle routing problem with time windows (MTVRPTW).

478,478,Controllable video captioning with pos sequence guidance based on gated fusion network,"In this paper, we propose to guide the video caption generation with Part-of-Speech (POS) information, based on a gated fusion of multiple representations of input videos. We construct a novel gated fusion network, with one particularly designed cross-gating (CG) block, to effectively encode and fuse different types of representations, e.g., the motion and content features of an input video. One POS sequence generator relies on this fused representation to predict the global syntactic structure, which is thereafter leveraged to guide the video captioning generation and control the syntax of the generated sentence. Specifically, a gating strategy is proposed to dynamically and adaptively incorporate the global syntactic POS information into the decoder for generating each word. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, namely MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate that the proposed model can well exploit complementary information from multiple representations, resulting in improved performances. Moreover, the generated global POS information can well capture the global syntactic structure of the sentence, and thus be exploited to control the syntactic structure of the description.

479,479,Analyzing a centralized buffer in automotive production plants - A simulation study," All rights reserved.We examine the impact of a centralized buffer on the stability level of an automotive manufacturing plant, which is currently operating under differing premises. Many car producers establish mixed model assembly lines in a stabilized production environment to face the ongoing trend towards a higher number of models, customized features and technology leaps. Core of the stabilized production is an unaltered assembly line sequence, which is the baseline of the entire production process. A frequently used concept to attain sequence stability is allocating large facultative buffers between the production steps. These storage systems, e.g., an automated storage and retrieval system, require a noticeable invest and obstruct the limited floor space. The problem examined is motivated by the idea that a flexible centralized buffer has a balancing effect on the stock level of unpainted as well as painted car bodies. It decouples the production process with a smaller buffer size, consequently occupying less floor space and reducing investment cost. To quantify the balancing impact of a centralized buffer on the long-term stability level of the production process, all the functions of the decoupling module need to be considered. Analytic models often focus on specific functions and require constricting assumptions. We propose a discrete event-based simulation model to determine the optimal size of the centralized buffer. The simulation study reveals process related stability losses and measures the impact of external influence factors such as the cycle time. To verify the performance of this method, an empirical study with data of an OEM, who is facing the task to implement a centralized buffer, is conducted.

484,484,The role of packaging in omni-channel fashion retail supply chains – How can packaging contribute to logistics efficiency?,"Omni-channel retailing changes the distribution structures of retail companies. Integrating existing facilities, resources and processes may hold advantages regarding customer satisfaction and shopping convenience, as well as logistical efficiency, but are complex in the implementation. Since the logistical requirements for the packaging system in stationary and distance channels are different due to varying shipment structures, this hinders seamless channel integration. This paper investigates the role of the packaging system in omni-channel fashion distribution and identifies the respective challenges retailers and associated supply chain partners face regarding packaging when integrating sales and logistics channels. By means of a qualitative research approach including nine interviews from field experts, the current practices of retailers, packaging manufacturers and logistics service providers regarding packaging in Omni-Channel retail are derived. The results indicate that the requirements towards packaging in the different channels, especially in integrated DC structures, interfere with a seamless channel integration. With regard to the role of stores in omni-channel retailing, channel-adequate packaging types need to be used for store pick-ups, and related process-changes are necessary for heightening efficiency. Packaging represents a restriction for distance shipments, fulfilled by stores. Primary packaging is an opportunity to support channel integration. However, this requires early and cross-company collaboration. The main theoretical contribution of this paper lies in identifying packaging related challenges preventing seamless channel integration into omni-channel distribution, stating initial packaging solutions to overcome those and providing an outlook towards future requirements for packaging in an omni-channel world. The paper has also strong managerial implications for retailing companies implementing integrated omni-channel structures, processes and services.",60005870,Katholische Universität Eichstätt - Ingolstadt,Eichstatt,Germany,"['1710', '1706']",21.5,0.04875,0.3833333333333333,1

The first step of multiplication is called partial product generation. Partial products are simply generated in binary logic by 'AND'ing every bit of multiplier with the bits of multiplicand. No matter that the numbers are signed or unsigned, AND is the partial product generator in binary logic. However, the same process in ternary logic is not as simple as in binary. The AND gate loses its efficiency. The employment of an ordinary 1-digit ternary multiplier is not sufficient either since it only multiplies two positive ternary digits.

490,490,A bi-level stochastic optimization model for commodity rebalancing in humanitarian operations," All rights reserved.After a large-scale disaster hits, a number of relief centers for accommodating evacuees should be determined and various commodities should be delivered to those relief centers to support evacuees’ lives. However, due to the great demand and uncertain environment, relief centers may be still lacking in commodities but with different shortages (stock levels). To reduce the deprivation level of evacuees at all relief centers, commodities of different stock levels need to be rebalanced among relief centers. Following the initial multi-commodity distribution, it is necessary to design a multi-commodity rebalancing process among relief centers with different stock levels. The uncertain demand and transportation-network availability make this problem challenging. To handle the uncertainties, a bi-level stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming model was proposed to facilitate this multi-commodity rebalancing process. The goals of upper and lower levels are to minimize the expected total weighted unmet demand and the expected total transportation time, respectively. Finally, a randomly generated instance is tested and the computational results show that the proposed model can provide an effective and efficient decision-making in the multi-commodity rebalancing process.",60008783,Pusan National University,Busan,South Korea,['1700'],22.5,0.06323529411764706,0.536764705882353,0
491,491,Hybrid multi-stage algorithm for a multi-depot consultant assignment and routing problem," All rights reserved.In this research, a multi-stage hybrid algorithm is proposed to solve a consultant assignment and routing problem. All consulting works are performed on client sites, which requires consultants to travel from their home. There are specific requirements for consultants to perform the jobs that include the consultant skill matching, client priority matching, and dedicated consultants for certain client visits. Consultants are heterogeneous because they have different available working shifts, different skills, different service priority qualification, and different status (full-time salary based or part-time wage based). Besides, consultants are homed in different geographic locations, which makes their traveling routing problem a multi-depot routing problem. The multi-stage process breaks down the problem solution into three stages: clustering, cluster-based solution, and disaggregation of the cluster-based solution. The hybrid algorithm uses a commercial solver to obtain a feasible solution initially by solving a reduced integer linear programming (ILP). Then, a local-search algorithm is applied to improve the solution. The multi-stage solution methodology reduces the size of the problem to make the problem solvable. The hybrid algorithm reduces the computational time that makes the solution algorithm practical.",60015574,"The University of Tennessee, Knoxville",Knoxville,United States,['1700'],18.5,0.04170274170274171,0.39866522366522367,0

EEE consists of two parts named energy efficiency and environmental efficiency, which are related to energy conservation and emission reduction, respectively. Results show that the EEE of central south China is relatively strong, while that of northwest China is the worst. However, the efficiency of the six regions in China has a similar trend. In general, China's regional EEE is relatively high during the study period, but the internal development of some regions is very imbalance.

495,495,Influence of man machine ratio on production line performance of one person multi machine series production line," All rights reserved.One person multi machine is a typical feature of lean production systems. Operator-induced machine interference is a critical issue for one person multi machine workcell analysis. In this paper, the interactions for machine/operator are modeled as several subsystems according to number of operators on the production line. The efficiency loss caused by machine interference is equivalent to the efficiency loss caused by machine failure. A machine/operator interference subsystem is regarded as a workstation with equivalent efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, each subsystem is defined as equivalent to an unreliable workstation with the same efficiency. The production line can be simplified to a serial workstation with finite buffers, which can be solved and analyzed by using an iterative procedure which is developed by authors. Solution quality is justified by an industry-based case study.

496,496,Based on hybrid driven rolling window strategy for quay cranes and container trucks scheduling," All rights reserved.The scheduling of quay cranes (QCs) and container trucks (CTs) is a real-time scheduling problem. Most of the existing research is static planning for the terminal, which is not consistent with the actual operation of the terminal. At present, there are many research methods for dynamic scheduling. The rolling window strategy is an effective to solve dynamic uncertain emergencies. Different driven modes will affect the optimization effect of rolling window strategy. Considering the flexibility of QCs’ selection and CTs’ routing, this paper proposes a combination of rolling window strategy based on hybrid driven mode of periodic and event and genetic algorithm. Under the periodic driven triggering mechanism, the scheduling plan is suspended for rescheduling at the arrival of the periodic point, and under the event driven triggering mechanism, the scheduling plan is suspended for rescheduling when an emergency occurs. In the rolling window strategy, the choice of window size will also affect the scheduling effect. We compare and analyzes two different window size cases.

497,497,Prediction of transient temperature and prestress loss of the concrete beam under fire based on system simulation," All rights reserved.Reinforced concrete beam is component commonly used in the construction industry, such as buildings and bridges. The failure of the concrete beam in fire is a hot issue for disaster prevention and mitigation in construction industry. In this paper, the system simulation is used to analyze the transient temperature of the concrete beam in fire based on the finite element method. The accuracy of the simulation results are verified by fire experiment. Furthermore, the prestress loss of steel bars inside the concrete beam is predicted based on the theory of high temperature creep by using the data of transient temperature field. The results of the transient temperature analysis show that the internal temperature of the reinforced concrete beam changes much longer than the fire duration, so that a longer time is required in the system simulation. The temperature inside the concrete beam is smaller than the temperature outside in the fire, which means that the concrete has a good protection effect on the internal structure such as steel bars. After the fire, the prestressed steel bars inside the concrete beam show a large prestress loss, which lead to a decrease in the bearing capacity and performance of the beam. Therefore, in order to predict the fire resistance performance and post-disaster service performance of prestressed concrete structures, the system simulation should be carried out for fire temperature, concrete beam temperature and prestress loss of the steel bar.",60031419,Ningbo University,Ningbo,China,['1700'],26.555555555555557,0.10467908902691513,0.3464596273291925,0

To do so, mathematical models are developed, based on the concepts of bilevel programming and the weighted goal programming approach. Here, a strategy of centralized SC control is proposed as an upper level (leader) optimization problem, whereas the individual profit maximization problems of each of the independent SC stages are considered as lower level (follower) problems under decentralized control. To implement the bilevel programming concept, an optimization model is developed as a leader problem to coordinate different independent entities of a decentralized SC and a few independent optimization models for different SC stages are considered for the follower problems. We have introduced a solution approach to solve the proposed multiperiod model using a goal programming approach, where a target/goal value is set for each lower level optimization problem to obtain feasible solutions of the proposed bilevel model. A numerical analysis is conducted to validate our model. Moreover, our proposed model is compared with a single-level approach, where total SC profit maximization is considered, instead of optimizing each individual entities’ problems. The comparison shows that modeling a complete decentralized SC network with independent entities having individual objectives with our proposed model is more realistic and effective than single-level modeling.",60028333,University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia,Sydney,Australia,['1700'],28.125,0.06507936507936508,0.3384920634920635,0
505,505,The Role of the Stage of Metal Complex Deposition on Support in the Properties Formation of Supported Platinum Catalysts,"Abstract: The subject of this review is related to the development of research on the mechanism of interaction of platinum complex compounds, primarily, H2[PtCl6], with alumina supports and the role of this interaction in properties formation of the corresponding platinum catalysts. Based on the study of the composition of Pt(IV) chloride complexes adsorbed on the γ-Al2O3 surface, it was proposed that the complexes should be quantitatively discriminated as inner- and outer-sphere complexes in accordance with the nature of their binding with the support. The chloride ligands were found to be dominant in the bound outer-sphere Pt(IV) complexes, and adsorption of the complexes on the surface occurs due to the protonation of the hydroxyl groups of the support without any significant changes in the composition and geometry of the [PtCl6]2– complex anion. The binding of Pt(IV) in the outer-sphere complexes leads (after their reduction with hydrogen) to the formation of Pt particles with a relatively low dispersion containing platinum atoms mainly in a nearly Pt0 state, which are characterized by hydrogenating and dehydrogenating activity. The inner-sphere platinum(IV) complexes are the hydrolyzed forms of the chloride complexes formed by the replacement of chloride ligands by the hydroxyl groups of the support. Their reduction forms finely dispersed platinum particles containing a significant fraction of atoms in the ionic form, which increases the activity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst in dehydrocyclizations of n-alkanes. Several approaches were proposed that make it possible to vary the ratio between the outer- and inner-sphere platinum(IV) complexes (increasing the degree of hydrolysis of the complexes, or varying the nature of the surface OH groups of the alumina support) and hence to modify the properties of the catalyst. The possibility of selective synthesis of outer- and inner-sphere platinum(IV) complexes bound with other supports was shown for the Pt/MgAlOx system. Using the structural features of layered aluminum-magnesium hydroxides makes it possible to bind platinum(IV) in the complexes of the given type at high selectivity and to change the electronic state of Pt atoms in Pt particles and their activity in alkane dehydrogenations without changing the chemical composition of the catalyst.",60026991,Boreskov Institute of Catalysis SB RAS,Novosibirsk,Russian Federation,['1706'],38.666666666666664,0.04764705882352942,0.4964705882352941,1

508,508,Multi-objective optimization model for airport slot allocation considering inter-airline equity," All rights reserved.The contradiction becomes more and more prominent between the increasing flight demand and the limited available capacity in air traffic, which seriously affects the safety and efficiency of air traffic operation. Given the limitation of capacity expansion in supply-side, demand management measures are needed to maximize the utilization of limited resources. This paper proposes multi-objective optimization for series of slot allocation in a single coordinated airport to resolve demand-supply imbalance problem. Our research focuses on balancing schedule displacement among airlines to generate slot allocation result, with the consideration of trade-off between efficiency and fairness. We extend fairness measure by adopting the priority of slot allocation regulated in International Air Transport Association (IATA), in order to take fully airline preferences into consideration. Specifically, the efficiency of allocation is embodied in minimizing delay displacement of the whole system, the fairness among flights is reflected in minimizing the maximum displacement, and the fairness among airlines is shown in minimizing the negative utility of airlines by lexicographic order. The multi-objective optimization model proposed in this paper is solved according to four priority orders. As a result, the model is divided into four sub-models. The higher priority assignment results are added into the lower priority assignment model as constraints. Finally, the model is applied to a coordinated airport based on the daily operation data.

510,510,Neuro-fuzzy based perfomance evaluation modeling for sub-contracttors in supply chain management," All rights reserved.Supply chain is presently one of the critical strategies for the competitive edge in the form of alliance management. Several companies are joined together as a cluster in order to increase bargaining power of purchasing which is known as a supply chain. One of the key players of the SCM is sub-contractors which are needed to manage in pattern of standardization and systematization. However, the competitive advantage is measured by performance with fast responsive to change and reduce cost continuously. This paper proposes neuro fuzzy based performance evaluation modelling for sub-contractors in supply chain management of the automotive rubber part industry. Three major dimensions are measured based on actual sample factory model. They are delivery on time, back order clearance, and quality. The performance evaluation can be evaluated anytime while demands are being changed in order to optimize supplies of the sub-contractors. The sample of 6 companies are tested. Fuzzy and Neuro Fuzzy modelling can help the transaction of SCM members more conveniently and effectively.",60103462,King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok,Bangkok,Thailand,['1700'],16.8,0.13624999999999998,0.43,0
511,511,Study on contract coordination and government subsidy strategy of green supply chain for direct-fired biomass power generation," All rights reserved.Biomass power generation is helpful to build a clean, low-carbon and green energy system. In order to solve problems of supply chain disharmony and low efficiency of government subsidy caused by stochastic factors in biomass power supply chain, this paper establishes a two-level supply chain model under stochastic supply and stochastic output environment. The two-level supply chain consists of farmers+foresters and the biomass power plant. Through the calculation of the model, it is proved that the combination contract of ""surplus compensation + shortage penalty + revenue sharing"" can achieve the coordination of the two-level supply chain. The validity of the contract is proved by the data obtained from field survey. Finally, according to the model and contract coordination results of the supply chain, the government subsidy strategy is studied, and the government subsidy strategy for biomass direct-fired power generation is proposed. This study not only has important theoretical and practical significance for biomass power supply chain, but also provides a new perspective for government subsidy policy research.",60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,['1700'],24.285714285714285,0.08787878787878788,0.6068181818181817,0
512,512,Adaptive fraud detection system using dynamic risk features," All rights reserved.A major issue that prevents eCommerce merchants having a robust machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions is the rapid change of fraud patterns. The rapid change of fraud patterns alters the underlying statistical distribution of target variable that machine learning model was trained to predict, and this further causes the performance degradation for the model. It is well-known as “Concept Drift” in statistical modeling. To overcome this issue, we borrowed the general idea of concept drift and proposed a brand-new approach which adds dynamic risk features as model inputs. Dynamic risk features are a set of features built on entity profile with fraud feedback. They are brought in to quantify the fluctuation of probabilistic association of risk features and frauds in certain entity profile. In this paper, we illustrate why this strategy can successfully handle this issue under statistical learning framework. To validate this proposed approach, we applied it on different machine leaning models,(i.e. Adaptive Random Forest, Accuracy Updated Ensemble, Online Bagging and Boosting, and Leveraging Bagging) with real data from multiple businesses in production. The results showed that this new approach achieved a superior performance (better Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve) than a static model (without dynamic risk features) on the same data and model parameters.",60027090,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,Blacksburg,United States,['1700'],21.1,0.1414712602212602,0.45931337181337184,0
513,513,An agile product development methodology for personalisation under industry 4.0," All rights reserved.Industry 4.0, as the fourth Industrial Revolution, comprises of a variety of technologies resulting in cost reduction and efficiency improvement. Industry 4.0 changes the way that value creation transformed towards personalised product development. Industries and business sectors have faced challenges to improve customer satisfaction while there is a continuously growing demand for product personalisation worldwide. To address affordable personalisation, there are limited studies about how Industry 4.0 could bring significant value to personalisation at scale. Affordable personalisation is one of the ultimate goals to achieve in the era of Industry 4.0. The high customer demand and industrial completion encouraged almost all business sectors to meet customer’s requirements with the cost near to mass production. This paper investigates an agile methodology for mass personalisation under Industry 4.0. The cutting-edge Industry 4.0 technologies for personalisation, in addition to product development and personalisation, has been reviewed. Agile product development along with Cloud-enabled customer profile (CCP), personalised customer backlog (PCB), personalised product backlog (PPB), augmented, and 3D printing prototyping for personalisation has been proposed. A case study for personalised facial mask has been presented by using the Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, additive manufacturing (AM), augmented reality (AR) and Cloud technologies through an iterative and incremental process. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives have been identified. This study leads to a sustainable development approach when developing mass personalisation as a service. In this paper, the proposed methodology has been validated by using augmented reality and 3D printing based prototyping, which has been achieved by measuring performance through Big data and Edge computing.

517,517,The impact of network externality on retailer and supplier pricing and competition strategies," All rights reserved.Network externality, which affects the value of many high-tech and Internet-related products, may have a critical impact on firm strategies. This paper focuses on the strategy selection of various players in a channel structure. We design a sequential game among two suppliers and a retailer. In the developed game and model, we derive two optional strategies to the retailer, whereas suppliers can impact retailer strategies with their own pricing. We found that (direct) network externality typically had a positive effect on firms. Thus, greater demand should be derived from the greater contribution of network externality to consumer net benefit for similar products. Higher net utility typically generates greater demand. Firms’ decision is significantly affected by the scale of network effect. More important, we found that when the degree of product network externality of a weak supplier reaches a certain of high enough scale, competition strategy for the weak supplier is more profitable. However, both strong and weak supplier can benefit from a cooperation strategy when the weak supplier has low level of network effect and the strong supplier can price high. Thus, competition strategy is not stable in this case. In addition, we recommend an acquisition strategy as a sustainable and reasonable cooperation strategy.",60017161,National University of Singapore,Singapore City,Singapore,['1700'],17.25,0.10913976499690785,0.5296728509585653,0
518,518,Multi objective robust and simulation-based optimization approach for convergent supply chain with continued production despite the fraction of some part," All rights reserved.supply chains seek to reduce their costs and adopt a pure strategy to achieve competitive advantage. Companies therefore focus on the strategy of reducing inventories (raw material, product during construction, final product in stock) since inventory costs represent a significant part of total supply chain costs. But by adopting this strategy, supply chain versus Uncertainties and shortcomings are vulnerable. Therefore, companies should carefully balance the minimum costs and economic consequences of supply chain risks. One of the important decisions in utilizing the capacity of the assembly lines and preventing the stopping of production lines and sustaining the heavy costs of producing it, is the continued production despite the fraction of some parts. In this study, a three-echelon convergent supply chain, including a customer integrating other customers, a manufacturer, and several suppliers are considered. The customer will periodically announce to the manufacturer his approximated demand for the upcoming period. The manufacturer uses approximated demand and demand adjustment factor to calculate orders and determine the production plan. Also, in case of the possibility of assembling a product with fractional parts, instead of immediately transporting fractional parts, the uncompleted production policy is used and, upon the receipt of fractional parts, they are assembled on the final product. Therefore, reducing the premium freight, the cost of maintaining inventory, and the delay fine in delivery to the customer are conflicting goals, which requires multi-objective methods to solve. For this purpose, the problem is firstly modeled using robust optimization and the uncertainties in the problem are as far as possible addressed. Then, the results of the optimization are considered as the simulation optimization input involving all the uncertainties, then the output from optimization of the simulation is compared with the results of the robust optimization.",60022927,University of Tehran,Tehran,Iran,['1700'],24.333333333333332,0.04706959706959707,0.6467571644042234,0

520,520,Image saliency and co-saliency detection by low-rank multiscale fusion,"Saliency and co-saliency detection aim to distinguish conspicuous foreground objects from single and multiple images, thus are essential in many multimedia and vision applications. To achieve balanced efficiency and accuracy, most recent successful saliency detectors are based on superpixels. However, saliency detection with single-scale superpixel segmentation may fail in capturing intrinsic salient objects of complex natural scenes with small-scale high-contrast backgrounds. To tackle this problem, we present a simple strategy using multiscale superpixels to jointly detect salient object via low-rank optimisation. Specifically, we first build a multiscale superpixel pyramid and derive the corresponding saliency map by multimodal saliency features and priors at each single scale. Then, we use joint low-rank analysis of multiscale saliency maps to obtain a more reliable and adaptively-fused saliency map, which properly takes all scales saliency into account. We further propose a GMM generative co-saliency prior to enable the above approach to detect co-salient objects from multiple images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed saliency and co-saliency detector over state-of-the-arts.",60028512,Civil Aviation University of China,Tianjin,China,['1708'],21.375,0.07891156462585035,0.29773242630385477,1

To make sure the data submitted are in good quality, the inspectors are arranged to carry out the checkup on site either through random samplings or the appeals and reports from the public. Those enterprises violating the regulations thus make improvements as per the inspection results. However, in view of the limited manpower, the environmental control institutions will not be able to detect all the violators immediately if simply random samplings are applied. It is, therefore, an important issue to effectively and at the primal time to single out the enterprises with high water pollution potential.

The model is based on forced vibrations of a two-degree-of-freedom bolted structure. The finite element method and fractal theory were combined to analyze the contact surface strains and pressure changes and to calculate an analytical solution for energy dissipation. Parameters of the model, such as the damping ratio, load, preload, and loading frequency, were varied, and numerical simulations were performed in MATLAB to determine the influence of the parameters on energy dissipation. Increasing the load results in greater energy dissipation, while reducing the pre-tightening force first slowly increases the energy dissipation followed by a more rapid increase. As the loading frequency increases, energy dissipation at the interfaces gradually increases. Moreover, higher vibration frequencies lead to increased energy dissipation, suggesting that loading frequency is the main parameter affecting bolt relaxation. In addition, increasing the damping ratio does not significantly increase energy dissipation, therefore, damping ratio is not a key factor in energy dissipation.",60022281,Beijing University of Technology,Beijing,China,['1700'],22.25,0.08791666666666667,0.5141666666666667,0

There are more and more challenges for simulation credibility due to increasing complexity and dynamics. Risk reflects the uncertainty factors in simulation process, which has a great effect on the credibility of simulation result. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate credibility from the perspective of risk. In this paper, the credibility of complex simulation system is considered based on risk factors. Firstly, the risk factors existing in the simulation are recognized by analyzing the simulation VV&A, and quantified by the casual strength logical algorithm in influence network. The risk factors quantification results are finally expressed in the form of marginal probability. Then, the simulation evaluation result is calculated through an analytic hierarchy process after establishing a credibility evaluation framework. Above all, the proposed method in this paper considers comprehensively the subjective credibility factors scored by experts and the objective quantified risk factors. Through risk analysis, the expected invalidation of target events are obtained, and risk factors are reflected in the complex simulation system evaluation, which is helpful for reducing risk during simulation process. Thus, the evaluation results can be used as a rule for judging whether the complex simulation system can be applied in practice, and can be used as a basis of improving credibility.",60088567,Beijing Information Science &amp; Technology University,Beijing,China,['1700'],20.0,0.02343749999999999,0.4859375,0

To achieve a worry-free and productive shop floor, behaviours and work ethics of the employees are critical. However, the hierarchical structure of most companies prevents employees at the shop floor from having the central viewpoint of all the relevant information, disempowers them to make the final decisions, and deters them from initiating any continuous improvement agenda. Hence, there is a need to move towards de-centralized management and for companies to create self-managing teams in order to be more agile in problem solving and execution of continuous improvement initiatives. The concept of Mini Company can be applied to empower the employees at the shop floor to self-initiate continuous improvement projects and respond to production issues with greater agility.

The model must also ensure that manufacturing processes are environmentally friendly in terms of contaminant emission in order to reduce the occupational risk factors for employees. Thus, a set of criteria titled “Occupational Exposure Limits” (OEL) are defined to ensure the safety of the workforce in all production centers. These limits are intended to assess and control the occupational risk factors in workplaces. The permissible OEL of chemical substances depend on the type, definition, and specific applications. By introducing a mathematical model for LMIP1 and optimizing it through appropriate technical, engineering and management methods, this research aims to eliminate or control the workplace pathogens with a view to minimizing the employees’ limit of exposure.

The systems with a binder were prepared by two different methods of mixing zeolite with aluminum hydroxide. The samples were characterized by N2 sorption (at 77 K), X-ray diffraction, 27Al magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and adsorption of pyridine. Preparation of the zeolite catalyst with aluminium hydroxide was made by two methods: (1) mixing of powders and (2) combining appropriate pastes. Regardless of the method used for mixing there was no blocking of zeolite channels by aluminum oxide. The method of mixing zeolite with aluminium hydroxide powders promotes migration of aluminum from aluminum hydroxide/oxide to the zeolite framework. The results of n-hexane conversion showed that with Ni,H/ZSM-5 a slightly lower conversion than with H/ZSM-5 catalyst was observed that can be explained by a reduced yield of cracking products. Ni,H/ZSM-5–Al2O3 (1 : 1) catalytic systems were insignificantly less efficient in n-hexane transformation than alumina free samples but at the same time they were less selective towards hydrocarbons with boiling temperatures higher than this of n-hexane, precursors of carbonaceous deposits.",60019987,Wrocław University of Science and Technology,Wroclaw,Poland,['1706'],23.625,-0.011111111111111096,0.42500000000000004,1

Considering the value-added service provided by the third-party platform has different effect on the utility of manufacturers and suppliers, we build a dynamic game model to compare the impact of it on manufacturers and suppliers respectively, and then analyze the influence of service efficiency on the optimal decision and profit of the third-party platform. We find that the platform will provide value-added service to suppliers when the service efficiency is low for manufacturers, otherwise, it will provide value-added service to manufacturers. Besides, the platform makes skewed pricing strategy based on the service efficiency.

If there are sufficient data of uncertainties to construct the probability distribution of each input variables, the conventional MRA method can tackle this problem. However, both aleatoy and epistemic uncertainties may exist in multidisciplinary systems simultaneously. The uncertainty propagation through coupled subsystems makes multidisciplinary reliability analysis computationally expensive and inaccuracy. This paper proposes a unified method for MRA based on Saddle-point approximation and convex model(UMRA-SC). In this strategy, the probabilistic analysis and convex analysis are decoupled from each other and are performed sequentially, which improves the efficiency of UMRA-SC. The probabilistic analysis is implemented based on the chi-squared distribution and Saddle-point approximation, which improves the accuracy of UMRA-SC.

To ensure no missing or misplaced wires in the jacks of each connector, manual inspection for mating portions of connectors is essential after the wires are installed on connectors. Manual inspection is an error-prone work that consumes time and effort heavily, due to the large number of jacks on connectors. In this paper, on the basis of techniques of RetinaNet and multipoint sequencing, a mating portions inspection method for connectors is proposed to automatic detecting incorrect installed jacks. Ground truth of assembly results, the information indicates which jacks of connectors are required to be installed with aviation wire, is recorded into an AR glass initially. Then connectors and jack-like objects are detected from the image captured by the AR device, using deep neural networks. The proposed detector enable to detect objects suffered blurred pixels, and pins in small areas of one percent of the whole image size. The detected jacks are numbered anticlockwise to acquire its serial number by multipoint sequencing. This approach efficiently clusters discrete points into separated regions and numbers them, even these points are subjected to weak deformations. Updating the results of multipoint sequencing, these detected jacks in chaos and out-of-order obtain their serial numbers and actual assembly states.

In the line balancing problem, the worker determines the cycle time (the target processing time) of each process on the premise that there is a specific characteristic (for example, the processing time for work content). Consider the case where the actual processing time of the worker fluctuates probabilistically, set the target processing time of each process, and assume that the actual processing time may be shorter or longer than the target processing time. If the target processing time is variable, consider how to arrange each worker to minimize the total expected cost of the production line. In previous researches, rules of optimal worker assignment with three kinds of workers, which are distinguished by the capacity of processing, were proposed when the target processing time was constant. In this paper, we deal with the optimal assignment rules with three kinds of workers under this LCMwMP (limited-cycled model with multiple periods) model when the target processing time follows the continuous distribution.

Ambiguous results in decision-making are obtained through the use of different methods for source-data processing. In order to obtain a single result from an aggregate of such decisions, it is suggested to apply the principle of selecting the decision that is most proposed by John von Neumann to increase the reliability of computers. Based on multiset theory, we develop a mathematical model of selecting a single result from an aggregate of alternatives obtained using different methods of decision-making. In this model, a decision is selected based on computing the argument of maximizing the multiplicity functions of elements for the arithmetic sum of multisets of the obtained decisions. The peculiarities of applying this approach are considered and methods of adjusting the source data for obtaining a single result are proposed. By the example of selecting a metal for electroplating products we present the results (of the decisions taken) obtained by a group of experts using the described approach.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient utilization for failure information, a reliability model based on Weibull mixture distribution is proposed to deal with the failure information of CNC system. Considering the complexity of the model, the fuzzy clustering method is used to classify the time-to-failure data. Meanwhile, the parameters of the mixed Weibull distribution are obtained separately and the reliability model of the CNC system can be developed. Finally, the three kinds of evaluation indexes are used to compare the accuracy of fitting the data life grounded on the mixed Weibull model and the single Weibull model. And the validity of applying the Weibull mixture distribution to the reliability model of the CNC system is verified.",60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,['1700'],25.833333333333332,-0.058008658008658,0.36493506493506495,0
561,561,Strength analysis and optimization of bridge expansion joint based on computer simulation," All rights reserved.In the bridge structures, the expansion joint is prone to damage due to insufficient strength under the dynamic load of the vehicles. In this paper, a method for the strength analysis of the bridge expansion joint is proposed based on computer simulation, and then the dynamic stress of the structure under vertical and horizontal wheel load is calculated. The strength of the expansion joint structure was examined by the pulsation strength criterion of the material under asymmetric cyclic loading. The results of computer simulation show that the largest dynamic stress of the expansion joint lies at the weld seam under the center beam, and this stress may exceed the pulsation strength of the material of the structure. This dangerous position from computer simulation is consistent with the damage position of the practical expansion joints in engineering. In order to overcome the possible damage, two methods are found to reduce the maximum stress in the expansion joint under the action of moving vehicle. The first method is to change the fullness of the weld seam in the expansion joint, and an optimized fullness can reduce the maximum stress of the structure to meet the strength requirement. The second method is to reduce the velocity of the vehicle because the maximum stress of the expansion joint increases as the vehicle velocity increases.",60031419,Ningbo University,Ningbo,China,['1700'],27.875,-0.02045454545454545,0.3234848484848485,0

All physical assets that are directly or indirectly added to the product produced in a production system and the product itself can be considered within the concept of inventory. Inventory is measured by the amount or monetary value of the assets and each asset held in inventory constitutes an extra cost. Controlling these costs is defined as a difficult problem. In order to control costs and measure the effect of each parameter on costs, an inventory model based on random demands is proposed. In order to interpret the result correctly, it is necessary to run a sufficient number of scenarios based on all parameters.

Donations are also an important part of relief goods. The relief goods distribution problem with the considering of donation is studied. Donations from the humanitarian organization include the earmarking donation and non-earmarking donation. The conditional earmarking means that only a part of donations are earmarked to the demand area. The rest donations are arranged by the emergency management agency. Both the two organization want to maximize its utility. Therefore, competition exists between the two organizations. A utility model is proposed based on the marginal utility. The marginal utility is used to measure the added utility when the demand area receives the relief goods. Then, the Lagrange multiplier method is incorporated to solve the proposed model. At last, a numerical experiment is provided. The conditional earmarking donation strategy and the full earmarking donation strategy are discussed.

How to improve the forecasting accuracy is an important issue. There are many researches made on this. But there are rooms for improvement. In this paper, a new method for cumulative forecasting method is proposed. The data is cumulated and to this cumulated time series, the following method is applied to improve the forecasting accuracy. Focusing that the equation of exponential smoothing method(ESM) is equivalent to (1,1) order ARMA model equation, the new method of estimation of smoothing constant in exponential smoothing method is proposed before by us which satisfies minimum variance of forecasting error. Trend removing by the combination of linear and 2nd order nonlinear function and 3rd order non-linear function is executed to the for the daily shipping data of Udon Noodles. Furthermore, “a day of the week index” is newly introduced. The forecasting result is compared with the cumulative forecasting method and the non-cumulative forecasting method.

In order to improve the efficiency of visibility analysis, this paper presents a visibility analysis solution for laser tracker system based on perspective projection. First, the mathematic definition of visibility analysis is proposed. The visibility between measurement points and configuration stations can be described by this model. Then, enveloping box is used to simplify obstacles in the measurement field, and obstacles which will not affect analysis can be distinguished according to the spatial relationship between obstacles, measurement points and configuration stations. Meanwhile, based on perspective projection, the analysis matrix can be obtained according to the measurement points and the projection of obstacles.

Dynamisms and complexities faced by the production planner include work order dependencies, resource availability, level of priority of the customer requesting the order, etc. Given the manual manner of generating a schedule, the status of on-going orders have changed and this invalidates the schedule generated. Planners require a tool that allows them to respond more quickly to the rapid changing production floor, job order status updates and frequent order insertions while still being able to capture the multitude of constraints that the production environment presents.

Using the constituents of North American hedge funds Index from June 2007 to December 2017, we estimate parameters of three different models: the Linear Factor Model including non-linear regressors) and two Non-linear Models (Regime-switching Beta Model and Regime-switching Beta-ARFIMA). By applying Linear Factor Model including non-linear regressors, we give evidence and show the necessity to consider the exposures of hedge funds to risk factors. The Regime-switching Beta Model allows studying the dynamic risk exposures of hedge funds in two different states of the market (up-market, down-market). Investors and regulators can obtain relevant information on cases in which hedge funds are putting their bets to react accordingly. Based on the highest explanatory power we show that the mixture model, Regime-switching Beta-ARFIMA Model that takes into account long-memory phenomena is the best-adapted model for evaluating hedge funds performance. In addition to the performance evaluation, the model considers performance persistence through the estimation of the fractional integrated parameter which is linked to the Hurst exponent.

578,578,A novel approach to solving the feasible domain of large-scale measurement instruments based on potential energy field," All rights reserved.The fabrication and assembly of aircraft, spacecraft and other large products are increasingly dependent on quality assurance provided by large-scale measurement techniques and instruments, and optimal configuration of measurement systems is one of the core issues. Measurement system configuration can be decomposed into two stages, the rough configuration and the detailed configuration. The key issue of rough configuration is visibility analysis of measuring characteristics or measuring points. At present, the visibility analysis of the large-scale measurement techniques heavily relies on intuition experience, and lacks of effective theory and method. Inspired by the Artificial Potential Field method used in the path planning for mobile robot obstacle avoidance, this paper presents a novel approach to solve the feasible domain of large-scale measurement instrument based on potential energy field during visibility analysis. First of all, combining with the actual conditions of typical large-scale measurement, considering the obstacles constraints, a potential energy function which includes obstacle distance, obstacle superficial area and visual angle of measurement instrument is constructed in this paper. Through the analysis of 3D workshop model, the constructed potential energy function gives each measurement position a virtual potential energy to characterize the effect of the obstructions in the scene to the measurement light. The measurement position is obtained by rasterizing before rough configuration. Then, the virtual potential energy distribution can be calculated automatically based on the 3D scene model of shop floor, and the level of the potential energy reflects the visibility conditions of measurement instrument to the targets. With a reasonable potential energy threshold, the set of instrument stations which are visible to targets points can be obtained which constitutes the feasible region of measuring instruments. Finally, an example of measurement scenario about aircraft door inspection fixture shows that the proposed method is effective and feasible. The proposed method to solve the rough configuration of large-scale measurement instruments lays a foundation for detailed configuration of measurement instruments.",60084617,Chengdu Aircraft Industrial (Group) Co.

In the process of development, market demand is uncertain. There is a risk of loss of profits among members of SaaS service supply chain. From the perspective of risk preference, this paper discusses contract coordination in SaaS service supply chain. We consider a two-stage SaaS service supply chain composed of SaaS service platform and independent software provider ISV. We discuss the decentralized decision-making of supply chain members under different risk aversion situations, and propose compensation contracts and risk sharing-penalty contracts based on service quality test results. The results show that under in the risk aversion environment, the risk-sharing penalty contract can promote the simultaneous coordination of effort level and capacity supply, and maximize the overall benefit of the supply chain; the cost-sharing compensation contract cannot promote the coordination of effort level and capacity supply. It can effectively realize the growth of supply chain revenue and enhance the stability of supply chain operation, but it does not maximize the supply chain revenue. The increase of risk aversion level will lead to the reduction of the feasible domain of contract coordination, weaken the coordination ability of the two contracts, and increase the coordination difficulty of the supply chain.",60025785,Shanghai Maritime University,Shanghai,China,['1700'],23.333333333333332,0.15,0.38125,0

A two-step ensemble cost-sensitive fault diagnostic method with a reliable static cost matrix determination approach from criticality analysis is proposed to deal with the issue. The cost-sensitive method in this paper is to use the random forest algorithm as the meta-classifier in MetaCost framework, and assembles the base weak classifiers together through two-step bagging.

Previous cat-eye detection methods such as CEIR, MSPF, etc, basically based on the grayscale and shape of the objects in the image. Although the recognition rate of cat-eye is high, it will cause false detections that identify objects such as street lamps and glass as cat-eye targets. In recent years, deep learning has developed rapidly and has achieved the results far better than traditional methods in many directions. Therefore, we try to use deep learning methods to study in the cat-eye detection. Based on the existing detection methods, a new loss function is proposed. Experiments show that our deep learning-based detection method maintains a high recognition rate and reduces the false detection rate.

596,596,The integrative link between cyber physical production systems and enterprise information systems," All rights reserved.In the era of industry 4.0, an extremely promising technology is the Cyber Physical System (CPS), which makes the fusion of the physical and the virtual world. The application of CPS in the production environment leads to the development of Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). CPPSs hold great potential to make production systems become intelligent, resilient and self-adaptive. The number of articles on CPPSs has been growing very fast, but largely detached from industry practices. One of the main obstacles is to make the integrative link between CPPSs and Enterprise Information Systems (EISs). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a meta model to formalize this link. First, the definitions of CPPSs and EISs are given, and the meaning of the integrative link between CPPSs and EISs is illustrated from an informational dimension, a technological dimension and an organizational dimension. Then, after analyzing the existing studies of linking CPPSs and EISs in the literature, we can conclude that none of the research conceptualizes the integrative link between CPPSs and EISs. Therefore, at last, a meta model that conceptualizes this link is proposed. The meta model describes the main classes that constitute CPPSs and EISs, and clearly highlights the links between these classes.

Using records from a Brazilian financial institution, this study uses a database of 5,432 companies that are clients of the bank, where 2,600 clients are classified as non-defaulters, 1,551 are classified as defaulters and 1,281 are temporarily defaulters, meaning that the clients are overdue on their payments for up 180 days. For each case, a total of 15 attributes was considered for a one-against-all assessment using four different techniques: Artificial Neural Networks Multilayer Perceptron (ANN-MLP), Artificial Neural Networks Radial Basis Functions (ANN-RBF), Logistic Regression (LR) and finally Support Vector Machines (SVM). For each method, different parameters were analyzed in order to obtain different results when the best of each technique was compared. Initially the data were coded in thermometer code (numerical attributes) or dummy coding (for nominal attributes). The methods were then evaluated for each parameter and the best result of each technique was compared in terms of accuracy, false positives, false negatives, true positives and true negatives. This comparison showed that the best method, in terms of accuracy, was ANN-RBF (79.20% for non-defaulter classification, 97.74% for defaulters and 75.37% for the temporarily defaulter classification). However, not always did the best accuracy represent the best technique for the assessment of this problem. For instance, on the classification of temporarily defaulters, this technique, in terms of false positives, was surpassed by SVM, which had the lowest rate (0.07%) of false positive classifications.

600,600,The effects of additive manufacturing process factors on component geometric shape deviation: A review," All rights reserved.The geometric shape deviation of manufactured components is a vital issue to be considered in the additive manufacturing (AM) process design step. Various factors in the process design step would affect the geometric shape deviation of the final AM components. Normally, the procedure of AM process design consists of model transformation into Standard Tessellation Language (STL)/Additive Manufacturing File (AMF), build orientation determination, support structure design, slicing setting, scanning path planning, machine parameters setting in layered manufacturing and post-processing design. And the types of approximate surfaces of input files, meshing strategies, build orientation, support structure, slicing pattern, etc. could be the contributors of geometric deviation. Numerous research efforts concerning the influence of these process factors on component geometric shape deviation have been carried out. This paper provides a review of such research work from three perspectives: process stage and environment parameters; systematic and random errors as well as single factor and multiple factors. The influence analyses of AM process factors on component geometric shape deviation in current relevant literatures are discussed and summarized from the above-mentioned perspectives.

601,601,The two-echelon time-constrained vehicle routing problem with second-echelon vehicle fleet mix," All rights reserved.In the routing literature that considered the intercity linehaul and urban deliveries being synchronously operated, the two-echelon time-constrained vehicle routing problem (2E-TVRP) was introduced. The 2E-TVRP involves the intercity-linehaul echelon where large-capacity vehicles (i.e., tractor and semitrailer combinations) transport cargoes among city distribution centers (CDCs) and the urban-delivery echelon where small-capacity vehicles (i.e., single-unit trucks) deliver cargoes from CDCs to satellites. The 2E-TVRP has the characteristics of two-echelon, homogeneous vehicles on each echelon, time windows and time constraints to ensure the route interaction. Considering that most of logistics and supply-chain enterprises employ heterogeneous fleets of vehicles on the second echelon, we introduce the 2E-TVRP with second-echelon vehicle fleet mix to make the 2E-TVRP more realistic. We develop the vehicle flow formulation, which takes constraints on identifying the first-departure truck and synchronization constraints as the key. We provide the heuristic that incorporates a savings-based algorithm followed by the variable neighborhood search. Both the vehicle flow formulation and the heuristic are tested by solving some illustrative examples. The case study on realistic instances (with up to 23 nodes on the first echelon and 1008 nodes on the second echelon) evaluates the applicability of the developed model and heuristic.",60013789,Beihang University,Beijing,China,['1700'],24.875,0.16833333333333336,0.32999999999999996,0

603,603,Study on the transportation capacity expansion plan under demand uncertainty," All rights reserved.The third-party logistics companies are one of the major components of today’s supply chains. However, due to the volatile demand and limited budget, it is hard for a company to establish its capacities properly. Over-capacity will lead to a high idle cost in low demand seasons while under-capacity will result in a low order fulfillment rate in high demand seasons. Besides, the demands of companies are heterogeneous, some require for high-quality transportation service, others require for general-quality service. So it is essential for third-party logistics companies to focus on approaches that can assist them in finding a trade-off between minimizing the total cost and setting an appropriate order fulfillment rate when faced with demand uncertainty. In this paper, we formulate a two-stage chance-constrained stochastic programming model that captures demand uncertainty, in which the chance constraint represents the demand fulfillment rate. And the sample average approximation method is used to solve the model so as to analyze the mixed use of two transportation expansion strategies and the existing capacity for managers to provide insights on how to establish capacities and allocate them to different demands. An example is provided and a sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze the effect of sample size, service level, demand uncertainty and demand correlation. This model emerges as a valuable tool to help decision makers to establish capacities before the demand realization and allocate capacities after the demand realization, with the aim of getting a proper fulfillment rate and minimizing the total cost.",60033100,Nanjing University,Nanjing,China,['1700'],27.77777777777778,0.014376750700280114,0.41114845938375344,0
604,604,Evaluation of the removal of anomalies in data collected by sensors," All rights reserved.In Industry 4.0, a large number of different sensors are installed in production systems and connected to artificial intelligence to make inferences about the environment and thereby assist human operators in the supervision, monitoring and optimization of production. However, the variables of the environment in which the sensors are inserted can induce noise and data loss, making it necessary to employ an appropriate screening mechanism for the analysis of these data. Thus, it is necessary to analyse the performance of different statistical algorithms for the detection of anomalies to identify the most efficient and fastest algorithm for the removal of anomalous data from a set of data automatically collected by sensors. We performed 216 experiments in which an experiment was defined as the combination of an anomaly detection algorithm, a machine learning algorithm and a class. For the experiments, we use 6 anomaly detection algorithms, 2 machine learning algorithms and 3 different classes from the cement industry. In this study, the most effective anomaly detection algorithms, in descending order, were Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) (with parameters: Gaussian and 0.3), box plot (with parameter 0.5), KDE (with parameters: exponential and 0.3), KDE (with parameters: TopHat and 0.3) and box plot (with parameter 1.5). Therefore, removing data considered anomalous using statistical techniques generally produces a positive impact for the prediction of new values and quickly removes the anomalies, which is useful for systems that are in dynamic environments and that need to make inferences in a short period of time.",60072629,SS Cyril and Methodius University,Skopje,North Macedonia,['1700'],35.857142857142854,0.14532923217133745,0.5313283208020049,0
605,605,A convolutional neural networks with strong generalizability for fault diagnostics of rotating machinery," All rights reserved.The fault diagnostics of rotating components are crucial for most mechanical systems since the failure of rotating components are the main faults of most mechanical systems. In traditional diagnostics approaches, extracting features from raw input is an important prerequisite and normally requires manual extraction based on signal processing techniques. This suffers problems such as the strong dependence on domain expertise, the high sensitivity to different mechanical systems, the poor flexible and generalization ability, and the limitations of mining new features, etc. In this paper, we proposed a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model for rotating machinery fault diagnostics using vibration signals. The model learns feature directly from raw vibration signals without any manual feature extraction. The proposed model is validated by three datasets from different institutes. The first is ball screw lubrication states datasets acquired from a self-developed test bench. The second is bearing fault dataset from Case Western Reserve University and the third is gearbox fault data from 2009 PHM Data Challenge.

TOP can be viewed as a variant of the vehicle routing problem where its aim is to maximize the total gained profit from the visited customers. In such a problem, the number of vehicles is limited and each vehicle must satisfy the maximum travel time. Therefore, some customers will remain not visited.

The proposed approach mimics the main steps of the genetic algorithm, where both destroying and rebuilding strategies are considered trying an enhancement of the method.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a vision-based inspection scheme for aircraft cable bracket assembly state. The proposed scheme is capable of detecting the missing or wrong type cable brackets and getting their positions. This paper firstly uses the deep learning method for detection to find the missing cable bracket. Then we use the deep learning network to identify the type of cable brackets and propose a method to extract and match the key points for cable brackets’ 3D reconstruction.

The functions reveal the relationship between product performance and customer benefit with different price coefficient, and the relationship between product performance and cost with different subjective feeling coefficient, respectively. Customer requirements are mapped to the technical characteristics using Quality Function Deployment, and the technical characteristics weights are determined.

An intuitive interaction channel between human and robot is needed to enhance the efficiency and security of collaboration. In this context, an augmented reality (AR)-based approach is introduced into the industrial HRC to develop an intuitive human and robot interaction. The intuitive interaction uses an AR head-mounted display (HMD) to offer an augmented information feedback channel and to enhance the human worker’s in-situ perception capabilities of the manufacturing environment. Then a depth camera is used to monitor the human-robot distance to discriminate the safety status in real-time, which can be visualized to the human worker via AR HMD. In addition, a user interface to interactively operate the robot is also designed. A visual trajectory is displayed to present the planned path of the robot and can be edited by the intuitive user interfaces, and the 3D robot model is built to simulate the movement of real robot as a preview to improve the robot operation efficiency. Finally, the developed system is demonstrated by a case study, which shows that the developed system can shorten the required time for human worker to access the necessary information during production process, ensure the safety of human worker by the safety monitoring and feedback, and offer an intuitive robot operation interface to re-plan the robot movement without programming.",60022414,Wuhan University of Technology,Wuhan,China,['1700'],29.75,0.03333333333333333,0.26666666666666666,0

The overall structure and size of the device are designed, especially the socket-roller type seed-metering wheel, and its hole is determined as ellipsoid hole. In order to increase the interference intensity of seed-metering wheel to seeds and reduce the phenomenon of missing seeding during seed-filling process, v-shaped protuberance is designed on the seed-metering wheel. EDEM discrete element software was used to simulate two kinds of seed-metering wheel with and without protuberance, the simulation results show that the seed-metering wheel with protuberance has better seeding quality and the necessity of the design is verified. The seeding test was carried out on the seed-metering wheel with protuberance in the test bed, and the test results showed that when the designed seed-metering wheel’s revolving speed was lower than 50r/min, the qualified seeding rate, re-seeding rate and miss seeding rate met the requirements of NY/T 1143-2006 Technical Specifications of Quality Evaluation for Drills. When the revolving speed of the seed-metering wheel was 40r/min and the speed of the conveyor belt was 0.65m/s, the seeding quality was the best, and the qualified seeding rate, re-seeding rate and miss seeding rate were 78.2%, 10.9% and 10.9%, respectively.",60002833,Henan Agricultural University,Zhengzhou,China,['1700'],36.0,0.18571428571428572,0.29285714285714287,0

In order to solve constrained optimization problems commonly used in engineering more efficiently and accurately, this paper proposes a new hybrid algorithm called Complex-PSO. The algorithm is designed to find the minimum of a general non-linear function of several variables within a constrained region. The performance of the algorithm is investigated on three constrained design problems.

The semiconductor product demand has been rapidly raising with high diversity. Demand forecast provides vital information from supply chain to improve the quality of strategy decision making and product inventory planning. Owing to the uncertainty and variety of the products characteristics such as manufacturing lead time, semiconductor supply chain encounters difficulties when trying to build an efficient and accurate demand prediction model. Hence, this study aims to propose a novel demand forecasting model based on conditional generative adversarial network with autoencoder model to predict different products’ demand for customer demand fulfilling.

We want to quantify the monetary value of IIS to the agricultural company, who faces uncertainties in both demand and yields. Yields are spatial dependence, and they are affected by both controllable and uncontrollable factors such as soil moisture, nutrient, weather and climate. We assume that the probability distribution of the yields depends on the irrigation water, controlled by the IoT-based irrigation system. We compare the expected profits with and without the system. Without the system, the profit is maximized with respect to the probability distribution of the demand and the yields. With the IIS, the yields from different areas are predicted from the sensed data, and optimal irrigation water is determined analytically. In the numerical illustration, we show that the expected profit gain of the system is significant, when the yield variability is large, and the error of the yield prediction model is small.",60001921,Thailand National Institute of Development Administration,Bangkok,Thailand,['1700'],23.0,0.06720779220779222,0.5003246753246754,0

619,619,Coalitional Game Theoretical Approach for VANET Clustering to Improve SNR,"Clustering is considered as the potential approach for network management in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). The performance of clustering is often assessed based on the stability of the clusters. Hence, most of the clustering methods aim to establish stable clusters. However, besides the stability of cluster, good link quality must be provided, especially when reliable and high-capacity transmission is demanded. Therefore, this paper proposes a clustering method based on coalitional game theory with the purpose to improve the average of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel capacity while maintaining the stability of the cluster. In the proposed method, each vehicle attempts to form a cluster with other vehicles according to coalition value. To attain the purpose of clustering, the value of coalition is formulated based on the V2V SNR, connection lifetime, and speed difference between vehicles. In fast-changing network topology, the higher average of SNR can be achieved but the stability of cluster becomes hard to be maintained. Based on the simulation results, SNR improvement can be adjusted in order to balance with the cluster stability by setting the parameters in the proposed method accordingly. Further simulation results show that the proposed method can obtain a higher average of V2V SNR and channel capacity than other relevant methods.",60069380,Universitas Gadjah Mada,Yogyakarta,Indonesia,"['1710', '1705']",21.0,0.047222222222222214,0.5594444444444445,1

In its nearly 30 years of development, ERP has gradually added other resource management modules such as quality management, product data management and business process management into its system. While the scope of ERP is expanding, over-integrated information systems are turning information between enterprise departments into information islands. The centralized ERP system takes the enterprise as the core of the entire value creation network and optimizes resources and enhances competitiveness with the enterprise as the center. In recent years, influenced by the concepts of collaborative innovation and value co-creation, the demand for ERP has gradually changed from the information integration of traditional enterprises to the information network of modern enterprises. The current ERP system lacks the security and efficiency of information exchange. It makes it difficult for enterprises to form efficient networked point-to-point collaboration.

We think that business demand is susceptible to the buyer’s selling price and therefore investigate mixed performances and pricing decisions in the supply chain. We primary determine the predicted advantage per unit of time applying the familiar renewal-reward theorem and later maximize profit for the situations of independent and joint optimization. Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the suggested models. The results indicate that reworking on defective items in buyer and coordination in the small and medium-size enterprise supply chain enhances the entire predicted profit of the system, especially for situations where the demand sensitivity to the price is very high, and the backorder costs and the average rate of defective quality products are high.

Located in urban areas or even residential areas, frontend warehouses are typically very small due to the expensive rent and can accommodate only a very limited number of products. In order to improve the fulfillment rate directly from the frontend warehouse, we need to properly select the products for the warehouse in the face of future demand uncertainty. To address this challenge, firstly, given historical order data, we propose a prediction model combining exponential smoothing and community detection to forecast demand and structure of future orders.

However, there are barriers to the determination of quality costs, limiting the ability of companies to establish quality control plans at the lowest cost and consequently becoming more competitive. The paper objective is to develop a framework to define a quality control strategy for a given manufacturing process, by selecting amongst alternative quality control strategies (e.g., 100% inspection, statistical process control, and no inspection), the one that minimizes quality costs. Cost of quality determination depends on many parameters; many of them are volatile and uncertain. The framework represents such uncertainty by intervals and through simulation defines the best quality control strategy. A risk indicator is also developed to represent the possibility that the quality control strategy defined may not be the optimal solution in the future. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the model parameters with more impact on the cost of quality, allowing to create multidisciplinary teams that through cooperation, can better characterize relevant uncertain parameters, among the many parameters Industry 4.0 era makes available to managers.",60020475,Universidade do Minho,Braga,Portugal,['1700'],27.571428571428573,0.3145833333333334,0.44218750000000007,0

631,631,LEO satellite formation flying via differential atmospheric drag,"Formation flying involves multiple spacecraft flying with pre-defined relation to each other. This allows a number of individual, smaller satellites to work together and accomplish tasks extraneous to single satellite systems. However, the required precision of orbital positioning and control makes the maintenance of such formations quite challenging. This is particularly true for space systems without propulsive controls; even for systems equipped with active control, propellant consumption can be quite high. To facilitate orbital control, this study investigates formation flying in low earth orbit (LEO), focusing primarily on propulsion-free methods of control for micro and nano-class satellites such as aerodynamic differential drag. A fuzzy logic control algorithm was developed to control the satellites' position by manipulating the drag configuration of each satellite in the formation. The outcome of this study shows that successful formation control can be achieved using drag forces alone. The time taken for each formation control and by-products, including altitude loss are evaluated.

Purpose. The purpose is to contribute to elaborating methodological approaches to labor norming in scholarly research and development. Materials and Methods. Analytical processing of applicable regulations and scholarly research publications in order to develop approaches to norming scholarly research labor. Results. The authors consider that despite, in general, each R&D work is unique, there are elements that are common for all researches in different qualitative and quantitative combinations, in all types of scholarly research activities. In other words, all common elements, i.e. the basic activities, can be normalized based on unified coordinated system that takes into account a broad range of peculiarities, structures, and contents of scholarly research labor with consideration of differential need in creating new knowledge resulting from R&D activities. Theoretical and applied generalization presented by the authors facilitates the formation of a systemic and structural model for scholarly research labor norming. Conclusions. The obtained results can be the starting point for further improvement of the regulation of R&D sphere in the context of reforming the activities of Ukrainian higher educational establishments and R&D institutions.",60030043,Ukrainian Academy of Printing,Lviv,Ukraine,['1706'],20.8125,0.10388798701298703,0.5165016233766233,1

Reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from industrial plant is one of the most important environmental issues. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx is the main way to neutralize NOx emissions, the effectiveness of which is determined by the activity of catalysts that need to be improved. Problem Statement. SCR NOx with ammonia using aluminum-vanadic catalyst (AVC-10) is the main method for neutralizing toxic NOx in gas emissions from nitrogen industry plants. However, this catalyst contains toxic vanadium and does not meet present-day requirements for degree of purification from NOx and decomposition of residual NH3. Therefore, it is very important to develop and to implement a technology for manufacturing vanadium-free catalysts to neutralize NOx in gas emissions and for their further use in industry, which will help improve the environment condition. Purpose. To develop and to implement technology fundamentals for producing a highly active aluminum-copper-zinc catalyst for SCR NOx with ammonia to neutralize NOx emissions in nitric acid production. Materials and Methods. Aluminum-copper-zinc catalysts are prepared by impregnating γ-Al2O3 granules (grade A-1) with solutions of copper and zinc nitrates. The activity of catalysts is determined in a flow-bed reactor equipped with a gas analyzer. Results. A technology for preparation of nanophase aluminum-copper-zinc catalysts with a crust structure of the active layer for selective reduction of nitrogen oxides in gas emissions of nitric acid production has been developed. The technology ensures the localization of copper oxide in the surface layer of carrier granules, which causes a high activity of catalysts based on this technology as compared with conventional catalysts. Conclusions. The technological process of designed catalyst production has been worked out under conditions of Katalizator Additional Liability Company, Kamianske (Dnipro Oblast). Tests carried out using a pilot plant at operating unit for light nitric acid production at Ostchem have showed that the designed catalyst ensures reducing the amount of residual nitrogen oxides in purified gas down to 0.001—0.002 vol.% and removing almost all ammonia from the gas.",60068508,L.

It is crucial to detect and diagnose a possible problem on the lines before that occurs. In general, maintenance, repair and error detection operations of the electrical transmission lines are performed by humans periodically. However, these difficult tasks contain high-risks in terms of occupational health and safety. Moreover, it is not possible to continuously inspect these lines which extend over long distances by maintenance and repair personnel. For all these reasons, it is very convenient to use robotic systems for inspection on power transmission lines. By evaluating the data which are provided from sensors and cameras of robotic systems, it would be possible to take precautions before an error occurs. Robotic systems that can move continuously along the line would be able to gather continuous and uninterrupted information. Thus, potential problems can be detected and identified in advance. In this study, a single wheel drive low-cost mobile robot is designed and controlled which can work and move on the electrical transmission lines.

644,644,Supplementary frequency control in a high-penetration real power system by renewables using SMES application,"In modern power systems, the penetration level of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) is strikingly increasing. Where, many synchronous generators are being replaced by the RESs-based the power electronic devices, this will reduce the overall system inertia. Moreover, the intermittent nature of the RESs causes several control problems such as frequency/voltage instability problem. Hence, these disturbances threaten preservation the power system stability and can lead to system collapse. In addition, the secondary frequency control action (i.e., Load Frequency Control (LFC) will not be sufficient to maintain the system frequency close to its scheduled value. Therefore, this paper proposes an application of Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) system based on an optimal PID controller, which is optimally designed by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to enhance the frequency stability of modern power systems due to high RESs penetration. From the perspective of the LFC, the proposed controlled SMES can be used as a feedback controller with the aim of supporting the frequency control loops for frequency stability enhancement of the power systems. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is tested and verified through a real hybrid power system in Egypt (i.e., Egyptian Power System (EPS) that includes thermal, gas, hydraulic power plants, wind, and solar energy. The obtained simulation results by Matlab/Simulink software reveal that the proposed control strategy achieved superior dynamic responses satisfying the LFC requirements in all test scenarios.

As compared with other ways of thermal destruction of rocks, the rock destruction by low temperature plasma jet has advantage in terms of distribution of cracks in rock at a considerable depth, high heat transfer coefficient and high specific heat flux, simplified system of automation and remote control, and compactness of thermal tool. Problem Statement. Thus, the possibilities of analytical determination of optimal parameters of thermal effect on rocks are limited by solution of thermoelasticity equations and contact problems of strength theory. Such formulation of the problem is unacceptable due to complication of taking into account substantial changes in the physical and thermos-physical rock properties while heating and applying mechanical load.

A novel and robust design of viscous damper is developed in the current work, which can provide high damping for launch dynamic loading and low damping for on-orbit micro-vibration loading. In order to understand the nonlinear damping mechanisms of such a viscous damper, a theoretical analysis based on power-law fluid theory is given in this paper. The nonlinear effect and performance of the isolation system are demonstrated by launch environment tests and micro-vibration tests. The test results indicate that the isolation system guarantees the dynamic safety of CMGs under the launch environment and the micro-vibration isolation efficiency of CMGs on orbit.",60073699,China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation,Xi'an,China,['1706'],27.4,0.041818181818181824,0.3612121212121212,1

This paper proposes an approach for short-term day-ahead load forecast in rural hybrid microgrids in emerging countries. Energy4Growing research project by Politecnico di Milano department of energy in collaboration with EKOENERGY (www.ekoenergy.org) implemented in Ngarenanyuki Secondary School (Arusha, Tanzania) innovative control switchboards to form an energy smart-hub. The smart-hub was designed to manage the school's 10kW hybrid micro-grid comprising: PV-inverter, battery storage, microhydro system, and genset. Ngarenanyuki school microgrid's data was used for the experimental short-term load forecast in this case study. A short-term load forecast model framework consisting of hybrid feature selection and prediction model was developed using MATLAB© environment. Prediction error performance evaluation of the developed model was done by varying input predictors and using the principal subset features to perform supervised training of 20 different conventional prediction models and their hybrid variants. The objective function was feature minimization and error performance optimization. The experimental and comparative day-ahead load forecast analysis performed showed the importance of using different feature selection algorithms and formation of hybrid prediction models approach to optimize overall prediction error performance. The proposed principal k-features subset union approach registered low error performance values than standard feature selection methods when it was used with 'linearSVM' prediction model. Furthermore, a hybrid prediction model formed from the elementwise maximum forecast instances of two regression models ('linearSVM' and 'cubicSVM') yielded better MAE prediction error than the individual regression models fused to form the hybrid.",60120572,Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology,Arusha,Tanzania,['1700'],22.636363636363637,0.07669172932330826,0.34511278195488715,1

In advanced economies, oilseed flax is used not only for obtaining seeds, but also as a source of additional high-quality textile raw materials. In Ukraine, oilseed flax is the only domestic raw material resource that can become an alternative to imported cotton and fiber flax used for the textile and pulp-and-paper industries and for the production of reinforced composite materials. The analysis of the status of standardization of products from oilseed flax stalks indicates the absence of regulatory documents to determine their quality. Therefore, the development of such regulations and standards is a pressing problem of our time, inasmuch as the organization of processing and the implementation of these products in the conditions of the present-day market and customer requirements are impossible without appropriate standardization and certification. Problem Statement. The need to develop standards for products from oilseed flax stalks to determine their quality and commercial characteristics is urgent, since the approval of such technical specifications at the government level stimulates the creation of markets for the sale of oilseed flax straw as raw materials for the production of fibers that have a wide industrial application. Purpose. To develop domestic regulatory documents in order to control the quality of ""new generation"" bast raw material — oilseed flax straw — taking into account the modern consumer requirements. Materials and Methods. Based on the qualimetry methods, a complex methodology for determining the general quality of oilseed flax straw as an industrial raw material has been developed. Results.

A common technology to detect fire hotspots is to use satellite images and then process them to determine the number of hotspots and their location. However, satellite systems cannot penetrate in bad weather or cloudy condition. This research proposes a ground sensor system, which uses several sensors related to the indicators of fire, especially fire in peatland area with unique characteristics. Common parameters of fire, such as temperature, smoke, haze, and carbon dioxide, are applied in this system. Indicators are measured using special sensors. Results of every sensor are analyzed by implementing intelligent computer programming, and an algorithm to determine fire hotspots and locations is applied. The fire hotspot location and intensity determined by integrated multiple sensors are more accurate than those determined by a single sensor.

The development of railway transport is a necessary factor in the national development and European integration of Ukraine. Problem Statement. Nowadays, over 80% of rail tracks in the national railways does not meet the requirements for bearing high-speed and heavy-load trains and needs to be replaced. At present, Ukrainian Railways corporation buys rails in foreign countries, which requires significant foreign exchange costs, and therefore the manufacture of high-quality mainstream and switch point rails in our country becomes an urgent need. Purpose. To develop innovative options for organizing the production of premium rails in Ukraine. Materials and Methods. Rail steel. Experimental melting and metallographic studies (using the optical and electron microscopy methods). Results. A high homogeneity (high purity of boundaries and dispersion of primary grains, small inter-lamellar distance of perlite), enhanced properties of the rail metal ensured by conventional electroslag remelting (ESR), and similar characteristic of ingot steel produced by ESR in the current-supplying mold with twice as fast speed of formation have been experimentally proved. Experiments with high-speed ESR and test of fluoride slag in the mold on real continuous casting machine has created the technological framework for a hybrid process of continuous casting with electroslag heating of the meniscus in current-supplying mold (CC + ESR). Conclusions. ESR enables reducing the minimum hump rate of casting, improving the density and uniformity of the metal in the axial zone, and maintaining a high quality of the ingot surface.

Knowhow is confidential information in the field of intellectual property, which, in particular, implies the specific features of administering intellectual property rights for this object. The theory assumes that there is one legal mechanism to administer intellectual property rights to knowhow that is knowhow transfer agreement, but, at the same time, the transfer of the title to knowhow is understood as granting the right to use it. As a result, practically it is difficult to understand what agreement is to be used to alienate the right to knowhow and to grant the right to use it. Problem Statement. The applicable national intellectual property legislation has not been harmonized. The terms and definitions used in the general and the special legislation for contractual mechanisms of administering intellectual property rights are different, which causes their dual understanding and misunderstanding of the main purpose of agreements on administration of intellectual property rights, which is the administration of the very property rights of intellectual property, not by the objects of intellectual property rights. Accordingly, the choice of contractual mechanism for administering the rights to knowhow is problematic, taking into account the specific nature of the subject of the research associated with its confidentiality. Purpose. To identify possible contractual mechanisms for administering property rights to knowhow. Materials and methods. The methodological framework of the research is based on the following methods of scholarly knowledge: the general philosophical (in particular, dialectical), the general scholarly (namely, formal logical, structural, comparative and others), and on the special methods of scholarly knowledge used in legal science (for example, comparative, formal and legal, special, etc.). Results. A comparative legal analysis of civil law contracts, including agreements on the administration of intellectual property rights in terms of the possibility of their use in order to grant for use and to alienate title to knowhow has been done. Conclusions. The administration of intellectual property rights to knowhow can be done using all existing contractual mechanisms specified for objects of intellectual property rights in the Civil Code of Ukraine. However, since the freedom of agreement is one of the fundamental principles of the civil law, the separate introduction of knowhow transfer agreement may exist, but in the subject of this agreement it is necessary to clearly identify which exactly rights are granted under this agreement either the right of use or the right of alienation. When concluding agreements on the administration of property rights to knowhow, it is necessary to take into consideration the confidential nature of knowhow.",60023137,Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv,Kiev,Ukraine,['1706'],23.166666666666668,0.1603703703703703,0.4226190476190475,1

The development of information and communication technology (ICT) and digitalization of the society, which have been spreading around the world as a result of swiftly growing smart industry (Industry 4.0) are usually associated with an increase in production output and labor productivity and a reduction in manufacture and customization costs. Problem Statement. According to the Solow Paradox (1987), investments in computer equipment and technology are not accounted in economic statistics on increasing labor productivity as a result of computerization, which undermines the conception of favorable impact of electronics on production output and labor productivity. Purpose. To develop requirements for improving the economic and mathematical models for measuring the ICT impact on production output, based on the analysis of the advantages and shortcomings of the existing models of the computer technology and software effect on production output and the peculiarities of ICT development. Materials and Methods. The historical method for analyzing the development of models of ICT impact on production output, the comparative analysis of existing economic and mathematical models to determine the approaches to the selection of factors influencing the performance indicators, and the analysis of arrays of the initial statistic data. Results. Analyzed models and the course of their development have shown a favorable impact of ICT on production output and labor productivity. The Solow Paradox is explained by the fact that the share of computer equipment and technology in corporate fixed assets in the late 1980s — the early 1990s was insignificant, as well as by the lack of reliable statistics at that time and an imperfect methodology for its analysis. With the development of statistics as science and with the spread of computer equipment and technology, the Solow Paradox has been rejected in new models of ICT impact on production output. Conclusions. A set of models that take into consideration the institutional features of the national economic development, the life cycle stages, and the degree of implementation of digital technologies shall be used in order to clarify the ICT impact on production output and labor productivity.

The effectiveness of the adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) model-based observer for SOC estimation of the dynamic behavior of the battery is investigated. The SOC is a reflexion of the chemistry of the cell; it is the key parameter for the BMS. In this paper, three equivalent circuits models (ECMs) have been established and their parameters were identified by applying the least square method. However, the relationship between open circuit voltage (OCV) and SOC have been proposed by four mathematical functions model-based. In fact, the SOC estimation accuracy of the battery depends on the model and the efficiency of the algorithm. The AEKF method is used to estimate the SOC of Lead acid battery. The experimental data is employed to identify the parameters of the three models and used to build different open circuit voltage-state of charge (OCV-SOC) functions relationship.

Ukraine has a space monitoring system implemented based on the Dnieper radar that provides continuous space monitoring. Problem Statement. Radars of this type are large complicated high-tech engineering systems. The novelty of applied R&D solutions, long terms of radar station design and manufacture make impossible applying the existing development and production standards and, therefore, require creating new ones. Purpose. The purpose is to analyze and to summarize the features of development and manufacture of space control systems based on national radar facilities. Materials and Methods. The systematic analysis of the peculiarities of the Ukrainian school of radar control systems for outer space has been applied using the R&D groundwork and the Chief Designer documentation for more effectively solving specific problems related to creating new generations of radar stations. Results. It has been shown that in order to realize the information received by the existing radar, it is necessary to ensure its competitiveness in the growing market of such services, which is possible through both upgrading the existing facilities and developing new ones. Taking into consideration the specific features that inevitably manifest themselves at different stages of the radar life cycle, the sufficient R&D groundwork and the experience of creating radars of both the current and the future generations, a number of proposals on effective solution of problems concerning the space monitoring with radar facilities have been presented. Conclusions. To ensure the integration and to supply domestic science-intensive radars to international structures for monitoring outer space (MOS) is impossible unless the existing R&D groundwork is effectively used and the capacity of existing facilities is permanently built up, taking into account the MOS radar specific features.

671,671,Improving software development effort estimation using support vector regression and feature selection," All rights reserved.Accurate and reliable software development effort estimation (SDEE) is one of the main concerns for project managers. Planning and scheduling a software project using an inaccurate estimate may cause severe risks to the software project under development such as delayed delivery, poor quality software, missing features. Therefore, an accurate prediction of the software effort plays an important role in the minimization of these risks that can lead to the project failure. Nowadays, the application of artificial intelligence techniques has grown dramatically for predicting software effort. The researchers found that these techniques are suitable tools for accurate prediction. In this study, an improved model is designed for estimating software effort using support vector regression (SVR) and two feature selection (FS) methods. Prior to building model step, a preprocessing stage is performed by random forest or Boruta feature selection methods to remove unimportant features. Next, the SVR model is tuned by a grid search approach. The performance of the models is then evaluated over eight well-known datasets through 30%holdout validation method. To show the impact of feature selection on the accuracy of SVR models, the proposed model was compared with SVR model without feature selection. The results indicated that SVR with feature selection outperforms SVR without FS in terms of the three accuracy measures used in this empirical study.",60106035,ENSIAS-Mohammed V University in Rabat,Agdal Rabat,Morocco,['1702'],20.0,-0.026666666666666655,0.49,0

The territory of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra reserve is located in difficult engineering and geological conditions on the right-bank slopes of the Dnieper River valley and adjacent areas of the loess plateau. The stability and preservation of Lavra’s objects is ensured by special systems of engineering protection (retaining and water-regulating structures). Problem Statement. Most of these structures were built in different periods and did not always have proper justification and configuration. With the development of the Reserve, the conditions have changed for their operation, thus, there is a need to review their effectiveness as protective structures and to improve them. Purpose. Determination of feasibility, adequacy, efficiency, and condition of engineering protection systems of the Reserve to improve them and to prevent emergencies. Materials and Methods. The scheme of engineering protection of the territory (scale 1:1000); the plan of the current state of the Reserve (scale 1:1000); data of engineering and geological surveys, historical and archaeological materials are used. To determine the condition of engineering protection objects, field observations have been carried out (installation of marks, photo fixation). To assess the stability of the Reserve, mechanical and mathematical principles of engineering geology have been used in conjunction with the approaches of system analysis and the theory of engineering and geological similarity. Results. The landslides in this area have been established to be caused by active erosion of the right bank of the Dnieper River, significant amount of earthworks during the construction of the Pechersk fortress in the 17th–18th centuries, as well as by engineering structures that are inadequate to the scale and nature of geological processes and by their low efficiency. Conclusions. Improvement of engineering protection systems implies raising the level of their maintenance, combining the maintenance works with the landscaping and gardening activities, establishing a monitoring system, and taking into consideration the seasonality and abnormality of hydrometeorological processes. The implementation of the obtained R&D results will raise the effectiveness of engineering protection systems for the protection and preservation of objects of the Reserve.",60011313,National Academy of Sciences in Ukraine,Kiev,Ukraine,['1706'],19.823529411764707,0.06804029304029303,0.42170329670329665,1

Starting from the arbitrary rotation state, the satellite should end up with its angular momentum aligned with the orbit normal. The satellite is equipped with magnetorquers that provide the angular velocity damping. Two control strategies are compared, that is the simple exponential damping and 'weighted' damping arising from the classical sliding control implementation. The time response of the control system depending on the satellite inertia moments is analysed. Simple damping is proven to provide better results for the low control authority even for the significantly elongated satellite.

Yu., DOBROVOLSKIY, A.M., PROTSENKO, I.M., and NAIKO, I.V., 2019Introduction. Erosion sources of plasma provide a highly productive formation of ion-plasma streams by evaporating the electrode material and have been widely used in science and industry for synthesizing various coatings, modifying material surfaces, and for creating the sources of charged particles. Problem Statement. At present, the main problem in creating high-quality coatings is their limited homogeneity due to the presence of the microdroplet phase in ion-vapor stream of erosion plasma sources. Purpose. To create a new generation of erosion plasma sources, particularly, of vacuum arc-type ones that are free of microdroplets in order to efficiently synthesize high-quality coatings with predetermined functional properties. Materials and Methods. For creating sources of pure metal plasma, an original idea based on the use of axially symmetric plasma-optical system for introducing additional energy into a flow of dense multi-component metal plasma due to efficient self-sustained generation of fast electrons has been proposed. Such energetic electrons are able to effect the plasma flow passing through the system and, particularly, to evaporate and to eliminate microdroplets that essentially limit the use of erosion dense plasma sources for technological developments. Results. Conceptual design of combined source containing vacuum arc plasma source and axially symmetric cylindrical electrostatic plasma-optical lens in a single device has been created. The designed hardware does not have analogs worldwide. Conclusions. The research has opened up wide prospects for practical application of the proposed idea for removal undesired micro-impurities while keeping the mass transfer in metal plasma flow formed by vacuum arc source. Combination of plasma lens with vacuum arc ion source enables controlling low energy plasma flux towards the substrate (i.e., film deposition) or towards emission grid (i.e., ion beam generation).",60014814,"Institute of Physics, National Academy of Sciences in Ukraine",Kiev,Ukraine,['1706'],18.0625,0.0877116883116883,0.3577341991341991,1

The program of colonization of the Moon and Mars is gradually approaching the practical phase. Researchers are actively discussing various aspects of the presence of people on the surface of the planets. Problem Statement. The number one problem is housing construction: materials and construction technologies. The use of regolith — the lunar or the Martian soil — is supposed to be used as a building material. The construction technology involves the placement of astronauts heating furnace on the lunar surface for sintering bricks, followed by laying them in building structures. The bricks will print on a 3D printer. This idea will require the development and delivery of a 3D printer to the lunar base. Purpose. It is interesting to check the possibilities of simple and cheap options for creating building elements in the conditions of the lunar surface in the absence of a 3D printer and complex heating devices. The purpose of the research is to make a simple product by an additive method, modeling the process of 3D printing without expensive and complicated instruments and devices. Materials and Methods. The manual version of 3D printing using concentrated solar energy from minimally processed local regolith is a simple, economical method of making building components on the surface of the Moon or Mars. The materials used were sand and basalt of terrestrial origin. All necessary operational work for modeling the 3D printing process was done manually. Various devices were used to concentrate the sun's rays on the basis of paraboloid concentrators to create a thermal source of the printer. Results. Simple products from basalt powders and mixtures of basalt with sand were obtained by an additive method without the use of complex expensive equipment.

Today, it is well known that mushrooms (pileated fungi, macromycetes) are not only a traditional food, but also an inexhaustible source of substances that have a wide range of pharmacological applications. Some species of mushrooms are considered a source of physiologically important, so-called essential elements, such as Cu, Fe, Zn, Cr, Se, Mo, Mn, etc. Problem Statement. The biotechnological approaches aiming at enriching the essential elements of the mineral composition of mushroom biomass that is cultivated on a liquid nutrient medium and the fruit bodies of valuable edible species cultivated in the surface culture are relevant and promising, given the mineral composition of macromycetes is rather specific and characterized by a certain selectivity of the accumulation of individual elements from soils / substrates (species-specificity of accumulation). Enrichment with essential elements potentially has to increase the medicinal properties, biological activity, and nutritional value of such mushroom supplements. Purpose. To identify the bio-accumulative ability of Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm. and P. eryngii (DC.) Quél. mycelial biomass with the compounds of Ge, Se, and Mo. Materials and Methods. The content of Ge, Se, and Mo in the mycelial biomass of three strains of the Pleurotus genus has been studied by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method during cultivation on a liquid nutrient medium with the addition of germanium, selenium, and molybdenum compounds at a concentration of 10, 25, and 50 mg / l, respectively. Results. All tested strains have shown a high bioaccumulative ability: for germanium, the coefficients of accumulation are within the range from two to three orders of magnitude (404—3577), for selenium, they vary from one to three orders of magnitude (19—2118), and for molybdenum, they range from one to two orders of magnitude (12—162).

The establishment of regularities of the microcontact interaction in the friction interface formed by two moving bodies is an important step towards the creation of new classes of materials with predefined physicochemical properties. The relative motion of interacting surfaces inevitably results in wearing contact areas (microcontacts) of these surfaces, i.e. leads to the formation of fragments caused by destruction of more elastic material. Problem Statement. The destruction of the interface decreases significantly by applying lubricant films to the contact area. In the case of dry friction (no lubricant), the description of the contact area is a practically solved problem (the Hertz and the Johnson-Kendal-Roberts contact theories), while the presence of lubricant complicates significantly this problem, because one shall consider the rheological component of friction and the interaction of interfaces. In addition, the overwhelming majority of tribological studies were carried out using imperfect (rough) surfaces and lubricant films with uncertain component composition, thickness, and structure. Purpose. To establish the influence of the structure of self-assembling n-alkanes monolayers on their tribological properties in the frictional interface. Materials and Methods. The atomically flat surface of gold and one-component monolayer films of n-alkanes (CnH2n+2, n = 14, 16, 48, 50, 60). are used as materials. The scanning tunneling microscopy method is used to establish the structure of self-assembled monolayers on the gold surface as well as to control their destruction before and after the tribological measurements. The kinetic coefficient of friction μko of interfaces have been studied using a magnetic levitation tribometer. Results. The nonmonotonic dependence of kinetic friction coefficient μko on the length of n-alkane molecule has been experimentally established. Conclusions. The kinetic friction coefficient μko has been established to abnormally decrease for the n-alkanes with “magic length” (n times 16).",60014814,"Institute of Physics, National Academy of Sciences in Ukraine",Kiev,Ukraine,['1706'],15.631578947368421,0.20728438228438228,0.6330419580419581,1

Thanks to a rapid advancement of technology, the clothing industry is rapidly developing into a high-tech and capital-intensive production. This contributes to a high quality of design, pattern cutting, and manufacture. The industry is one of the fastest growing in the manufacture sector. Therefore, it is extremely important to enable industry professionals and researchers to keep pace with changes to achieve the desired competitiveness of products. Mobile applications for the garment industry (Stylebook, Cloth, Polyvore, etc.) have been analyzed. These applications contain galleries of clothing models, but only for specific styles of fashion and unrecognizable sizes. Therefore, they can be used as a guide for creating clothes of similar fashion styles but without the necessary level of accuracy. Problem Statement. Mobile applications that are now available for use in the clothing industry are oriented towards the sale of finished products. Since the design and manufacturing stages are provided with software products only at the ""home"" level, there is a need for the development of mobile applications for clothing industry experts. To develop such an application, it is advisable to choose a design methodology that is both simple, accessible, and known to a wide range of users. Purpose. To develop a mobile application for calculating the parameters of the main blocks of clothing. Materials and Methods. To create our application, an advanced and convenient programming language Kotlin has been used. Results. Based on the comparative analysis of the means of calculating the basic clothing designs, the expediency of using mobile applications in the garment industry has been proved. The existing mobile applications that are used or can be used in the design and manufacture of clothing have been classified. The quantitative classification analysis has confirmed the original hypothesis on the lack of mobile applications used while making a typical basic design. To calculate the parameters of the basic design of top wear, a mobile application has been developed. It provides support for the automated process of creating clothes designs, both in individual or small-scale production, as well as in the learning process. Conclusions. The developed package enables making specific drawings for top wear of any size.

Modern biotechnology is among the top priorities in every advanced economy. Problem Statement. Successful management of technology development requires an unbiased analysis of scholarly research results and their forecasting. The correspondence of technological development to the world trends plays an important role in ensuring the economy’s competitiveness. Purpose. The purpose of the study is to determine the world trends in scholarly research and developments in the field of biotechnology, as well as the correspondence of the situation in Ukraine to the world trends. Materials and Methods. Bibliometric and patent analysis is one of the most common tools for analyzing the current state, promising directions of scholarly research and commercial use. This research presents the results of analysis of the world and Ukrainian trends in publication and patent activities in the sphere of biotechnology for 2000—2015, as well as forecasts for 2016—2019. The trend models have been constructed for forecasting. Biotechnology-related publications of SCImago Journal & Country Rank portal, Science Direct database, and Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine abstract database, as well as patents of the World Intellectual Property Organization database have been used. Results. The forecast results have shown an upward tendency in the global amount of publications and patents in biotechnology, in the coming years. In all areas of biotechnology, the share of Ukrainian publications in the global space of biotechnological research is extremely small. Among the analyzed areas, the largest forecasted share of Ukrainian origin publications in international databases belongs to Materials Science — Biomaterials and amounts to 0.3% on the global scale. The patenting of Ukrainian developments at the international level, provided the existing trend is maintained, will also remain at a very low level (0.05% on a global scale). China and the USA, which have a share of 33.1 and 24.9%, respectively, will keep leadership in this direction The total number of patents belonging to the EU Member States (28) will reach about 18.1%.

694,694,The role of the control framework for continuous teleoperation of a brain–machine interface-driven mobile robot,"Despite the growing interest in brain–machine interface (BMI)-driven neuroprostheses, the translation of the BMI output into a suitable control signal for the robotic device is often neglected. In this article, we propose a novel control approach based on dynamical systems that was explicitly designed to take into account the nature of the BMI output that actively supports the user in delivering real-valued commands to the device and, at the same time, reduces the false positive rate. We hypothesize that such a control framework would allow users to continuously drive a mobile robot and it would enhance the navigation performance. 13 healthy users evaluated the system during three experimental sessions. Users exploit a 2-class motor imagery BMI to drive the robot to five targets in two experimental conditions: with a discrete control strategy, traditionally exploited in the BMI field, and with the novel continuous control framework developed herein. Experimental results show that the new approach: 1) allows users to continuously drive the mobile robot via BMI; 2) leads to significant improvements in the navigation performance; and 3) promotes a better coupling between user and robot.

The sorting algorithm works with pictures, captured by a web camera, pre-processes them, determines the mass centers of the recognized objects, and calculates distances to the points which were found. Afterward, the recognized objects are sorted by a hand-manipulator with four degrees of freedom. The manipulator is powered by Arduino Uno Rev 3 and servo motors of two types. The sorting algorithm has been implemented in Python, with the use of the OpenCV library. For image pre-processing, the spatial anti-aliasing, filtering, and morphological opening and closing have been used. Color maps have been created to determine the mass centers of the recognized objects.

This SERS is made by a two-dimensional array of noble metal which contains nano bowls with scattered nanospheres on its surface. Using the theory of transformation optics, we show that the curvature of nano bowls amplify the electric field around the nanospheres. This amplification is broadband due to the inherent nature of space transformation which does not rely on frequency. Comparisons with conventional flat SERS are done to demonstrate the advantages of the present design. We show that the curvature of these nano bowls increases the volume of the hotspot by one order of magnitude. This significantly reduces the response time of the SERS. Also, it is shown that this curvature amplifies the electric field in hotspot more than hundreds of times greater than SERS without using those nano bowls. The calculated amplification of the Raman signal is more than one billion times so this surface is a promising candidate for single molecule detection.

In this study, we examined the compression shear bearing capacity of the adhesively bonded single-lap joint structure of high-temperature-resistant composite materials (C/C composite materials). The test pieces were produced in accordance with the appropriate ASTM C1292 standard, which were used for the compression shear test. The failure morphology of the layer was observed by a digital microscopic system and scanning electron microscope. The experimental result shows that the load on the test piece increased nonlinearly until the failure occurred, and most of the adhesive layer exhibited cohesive failures at three temperature points (400, 600, and 800 °C), while the interface failures occurred in a small part of the adhesive layer. A numerical analysis model was established using ABAQUS finite element software. The simulation results were compared with the test results to verify the correctness of the model. On the basis of correctness of the model verified by comparing the simulation results and the test results, the influences of temperature and overlapped length on the joint compression shear performance were studied through the validated simulation method. Numerical results showed that the ultimate load of the joint decreased with increases in temperature and that the distribution trends of the shear stresses in the overlapped length direction were substantially the same for joints of different overlapped lengths.",60105827,China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology,Beijing,China,['1701'],25.22222222222222,0.01666666666666665,0.4480769230769231,1

722,722,The design of an automated system for the analysis of the activity and emotional patterns of dogs with wearable sensors using machine learning," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The safety and welfare of companion animals such as dogs has become a large challenge in the last few years. To assess the well-being of a dog, it is very important for human beings to understand the activity pattern of the dog, and its emotional behavior. A wearable, sensor-based system is suitable for such ends, as it will be able to monitor the dogs in real-time. However, the question remains unanswered as to what kind of data should be used to detect the activity patterns and emotional patterns, as does another: what should be the location of the sensors for the collection of data and how should we automate the system? Yet these questions remain unanswered, because to date, there is no such system that can address the above-mentioned concerns. The main purpose of this study was (1) to develop a system that can detect the activities and emotions based on the accelerometer and gyroscope signals and (2) to automate the system with robust machine learning techniques for implementing it for real-time situations. Therefore, we propose a system which is based on the data collected from 10 dogs, including nine breeds of various sizes and ages, and both genders. We used machine learning classification techniques for automating the detection and evaluation process. The ground truth fetched for the evaluation process was carried out by taking video recording data in frame per second and the wearable sensors data were collected in parallel with the video recordings. Evaluation of the system was performed using an ANN (artificial neural network), random forest, SVM (support vector machine), KNN (k nearest neighbors), and a naive Bayes classifier. The robustness of our system was evaluated by taking independent training and validation sets. We achieved an accuracy of 96.58% while detecting the activity and 92.87% while detecting emotional behavior, respectively. This system will help the owners of dogs to track their behavior and emotions in real-life situations for various breeds in dierent scenarios.",60015143,Inje University,Gimhae,South Korea,['1706'],27.5,0.028882783882783862,0.4568681318681319,0
723,723,Towards an Australian Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) facility," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Atom-Trap Trace-Analysis (ATTA) is a technique aimed at a measuring the relative (in comparison to the common isotope) abundance of exceedingly rare noble gas radio-isotopes (Ar-39, Kr-81 and Kr-85), for the purposes of dating water, ice and other materials that contain trapped gases. These isotopes exist with an extremely low natural abundance and require measurement capability down to parts in 1017. The noble gas dating protocol is similar to that of radio-carbon dating but, the three isotopes together, allow dating of materials in complementary ranges to that possible with the radiocarbon technique. In a facility jointly created by CSIRO, Griffith and Adelaide Universities, we use laser guidance, cooling and trapping to perform isotopic separation using the isotopic dependence of atomic energy levels. The facility is currently undergoing construction but has been shown to be able to produce metastable Ne and Ar, which can then be laser cooled and trapped. When combined with the existing gas separation facility at the CSIRO Waite facility, which efficiently extracts pure noble gases from that are dissolved in water or ice samples, we should be in a position to start measuring the age of real-world samples in the early part of 2020. In addition, to describing the current state of construction, we will also discuss two more efficient approaches for creating metastable atoms that can reduce samples size and avoid unwanted cross-contamination between samples.",60032987,Griffith University,Brisbane,Australia,['1706'],34.142857142857146,0.12065381708238851,0.470899470899471,0

All rights reserved.Cluster analysis, unlike most mathematical and statistical methods, does not impose any restrictions on the type of objects under consideration, and allows us to consider a lot of input data of almost arbitrary nature. Cluster analysis allows you to consider a fairly large amount of information and dramatically reduce, compress large amounts of technological information, make them compact and intuitive. The attributes of the “equipment” cluster are entered into the matrix, the rows of which also correspond to the elements of the technology content, and the columns contain the attributes of the equipment. The matrix is also filled with the necessary characteristics of objects that are not included in the list of cluster features.

725,725,A deep ensemble learning method for effort-aware just-in-time defect prediction,"Since the introduction of just-in-time effort aware defect prediction, many researchers are focusing on evaluating the different learning methods, which can predict the defect inducing changes in a software product. In order to predict these changes, it is important for a learning model to consider the nature of the dataset, its unbalancing properties and the correlation between different attributes. In this paper, we evaluated the importance of these properties for a specific dataset and proposed a novel methodology for learning the effort aware just-in-time prediction of defect inducing changes. Moreover, we devised an ensemble classifier, which fuses the output of three individual classifiers (Random forest, XGBoost, Multi-layer perceptron) to build an efficient state-of-the-art prediction model. The experimental analysis of the proposed methodology showed significant performance with 77% accuracy on the sample dataset and 81% accuracy on different datasets.

This publication strives to focus the discussion and enable future research in an educational setting with a strong focus on the Austrian circumstances and the goal to allow wide international adoption later on. Methodically, a literature review was conducted to gain knowledge about the current strands of research and a meta study to show the diversity of proposed and materialized studies. Three main questions were answered, establishing that CT as an idea is rooted in scientific literature dating back to the 1980s and grew in popularity afterWing introduced the concept to a broader audience. A number of authors contributed to the current state of the field, with the most cited review coming from Grover and Pea. The challenge to integrate CT in curricula around the world was met by many experiments and case studies but without a conclusive framework as of yet.

In this paper, we present a study in which six blind and six blindfolded sighted participants evaluated three of those interaction techniques compared to a screen reader condition. We observed that techniques providing guidance result in a higher user satisfaction and more efficient exploration. Adding a grid-like structure improved the estimation of distances.

The method used to realize this SPSM PCF is to deposit an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material in four selected air holes in the cladding, which ends up with four ENZ rings. These ENZ rings introduce significant LDs between the wanted (X-polarized) and unwanted (Y-polarized and high order) modes. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the LDs between the wanted and unwanted modes vary with the thickness of ENZ rings. With a very short length (4 cm) of the proposed PCF, pure SPSM propagation, i.e., the unwanted modes are 20 dB lower than the wanted mode, can be achieved from 1 to 1.2 THz.",60023932,University of Technology Sydney,Sydney,Australia,['1706'],30.0,0.10794642857142857,0.4708630952380953,0
729,729,Enhanced knowledge graph embedding by jointly learning soft rules and facts," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Combining first order logic rules with a Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding model has recently gained increasing attention, as rules introduce rich background information. Among such studies, models equipped with soft rules, which are extracted with certain confidences, achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, the existing methods either cannot support the transitivity and composition rules or take soft rules as regularization terms to constrain derived facts, which is incapable of encoding the logical background knowledge about facts contained in soft rules. In addition, previous works performed one time logical inference over rules to generate valid groundings for modeling rules, ignoring forward chaining inference, which can further generate more valid groundings to better model rules. To these ends, this paper proposes Soft Logical rules enhanced Embedding (SoLE), a novel KG embedding model equipped with a joint training algorithm over soft rules and KG facts to inject the logical background knowledge of rules into embeddings, as well as forward chaining inference over rules. Evaluations on Freebase and DBpedia show that SoLE not only achieves improvements of 11.6%/5.9% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and 18.4%/15.9% in HITS@1 compared to the model on which SoLE is based, but also significantly and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the link prediction task.",60019118,University of Science and Technology of China,Hefei,China,['1703'],34.666666666666664,0.10327380952380952,0.43399725274725276,0

Our approach draws on an insight connecting two existing works: Curriculum domain adaptation and self-training. Inspired by the former, PyCDA constructs a pyramid curriculum which contains various properties about the target domain. Those properties are mainly about the desired label distributions over the target domain images, image regions, and pixels. By enforcing the segmentation neural network to observe those properties, we can improve the network's generalization capability to the target domain. Motivated by the self-training, we infer this pyramid of properties by resorting to the semantic segmentation network itself. Unlike prior work, we do not need to maintain any additional models (e.g., logistic regression or discriminator networks) or to solve minmax problems which are often difficult to optimize. We report state-of-the-art results for the adaptation from both GTAV and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, two popular settings in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation.",60005465,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,Chengdu,China,"['1712', '1707']",21.375,0.07537878787878788,0.4359848484848485,1

The proposed method is based on the projection of the close loop augmented system and the associated linear reference model that it should follow over a basis of block pulse functions. The main advantage of using this tool is that it allows to transform the analytical differential calculus into an algebraic one relatively easy to solve. The developments presented have led to the formulation of a linear system of algebraic equations depending only on parameters of the feedback control. Once the control gains are determined by solving the latter optimization problem in least square sense, the practical stability of the closed loop augmented system is checked through given conditions.

These sensors are based on the Fiber Evanescent Wave Spectroscopy (FEWS) principle. Indeed, most of the molecules have their functional groups absorption bands in the mid infrared region and the fibers are able to detect the characteristic vibrations these of molecules. First, fibers have been developed in the frame of large-scale projects such the DARWIN mission in order to permit the detection of CO2 at 15 μm. A large activity was focused on the synthesis of Te-Ge-Se glasses, containing no more than 3% of Se but stable enough to draw fibers transmitting light until 16 μm. Then, single mode fibers have been successfully fabricated thanks to a new preform molding process. Finally, the growing need for sensors able to detect diseases in the medical domain or polluting molecules in the environmental area led us to develop very stable Te-Ge-AgI low loss fibers. These fibers have been implemented in FEWS experiments permitting detection of biomolecules, like sugars and lipids and emerging pollutants like benzene, and chloroform, in the spectral domain extending from 2 to 16 μm.

Thus, in this paper, we propose a measurement-based optimization technique for an open-source computer-vision application library, OpenCV, on top of a heterogeneous multicore processor. The proposed technique consists of two sub-systems: the optimization engine running on a separate host PC, and the measurement library running on the target board. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization technique has been verified in the case study of latency-power co-optimization by using two OpenCV applications-canny edge detection and squeezeNet.

739,739,The influence of AlGaN/GaN heteroepitaxial structure fractal geometry on size effects in microwave characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs,"The investigation of size effects appearing in the dependence of AlGaN/GaN HEMT high-frequency characteristics on channel width d and number of sections n is conducted using the notions of measure, metric and normed functional (linear) spaces. In accordance with the results obtained, in local approximation the phenomenon of similarity can exist, not only in metric spaces of heteroepitaxial structures, but also in the defined on them functional spaces of the measures of these structures' additive electrophysical characteristics. This provides means to associate size effects of the HEMTs with their structure material fractal geometry. The approach proposed in the work gives an opportunity, not only to predict the size of the structural elements (e.g., channel width and number of sections) of the transistor with the desired characteristics, but also to reconstruct its compact model parameters, which significantly speeds up the development and optimization of the HEMTs with the desired device characteristics.

741,741,Beam shaping in nonlinear volume holograms via optically engineered ferroelectric domain patterns," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Efficiency of optical frequency conversion in quadratic media critically depends on spatial modulation of the nonlinear optical response of the materials. This modulation ensures, via the quasi phase matching (QPM), an efficient energy exchange between optical waves at different frequencies. The QPM structures, also known as the nonlinear photonic crystals, offer a variety of novel properties and functionalities that cannot be obtained in uniform nonlinear crystals. In particular the 3-dimensional modulation of nonlinearity allows one to realize the so-called nonlinear volume holograms which extends the concept of volume holography to nonlinear optics. Nonlinear volume hologram represents the 3-dimensional distribution of the nonlinear polarization which arises from interaction between input fundamental beam and generated wave with complex wave front, in medium exhibiting quadratic nonlinearity (χ(2)). When illuminated by fundamental beam, the nonlinear hologram gives rise to a wave at different frequency (e.g. second harmonic of fundamental wave) having complex intensity distribution following the transverse structure of the hologram itself. In this way one can combine generation of waves at new frequencies with simultaneous shaping of their transverse and longitudinal intensity profiles. In this work we present formation of various types of nonlinear volume holograms in ferroelectric crystals by using unique all-optical domain inversion technique and demonstrate their application in optical wave-shaping.",60072753,Texas A and M University at Qatar,Doha,Qatar,['1706'],24.444444444444443,0.0060023310023310005,0.4221445221445222,0

743,743,A deep learning based printing defect classification method with imbalanced samples,"Deep learning has been successfully applied to classification tasks in many fields due to its good performance in learning discriminative features. However, the application of deep learning to printing defect classification is very rare, and there is almost no research on the classification method for printing defects with imbalanced samples. In this paper, we present a deep convolutional neural network model to extract deep features directly from printed image defects. Furthermore, considering the asymmetry in the number of different types of defect samples-that is, the number of different kinds of defect samples is unbalanced-seven types of over-sampling methods were investigated to determine the best method. To verify the practical applications of the proposed deep model and the effectiveness of the extracted features, a large dataset of printing detect samples was built. All samples were collected from practical printing products in the factory. The dataset includes a coarse-grained dataset with four types of printing samples and a fine-grained dataset with eleven types of printing samples. The experimental results show that the proposed deep model achieves a 96.86% classification accuracy rate on the coarse-grained dataset without adopting over-sampling, which is the highest accuracy compared to the well-known deep models based on transfer learning. Moreover, by adopting the proposed deep model combined with the SVM-SMOTE over-sampling method, the accuracy rate is improved by more than 20% in the fine-grained dataset compared to the method without over-sampling.",60026981,Xi'an University of Technology,Xi'an,China,['1701'],25.88888888888889,0.1966326530612245,0.46921768707482997,1
744,744,Non-randomized response models: An experimental application of the triangular model as an indirect questioning method for sensitive topics,"When it comes to sensitive questions, data is often affected by bias due to non-response or effects of social desirability. Several methods have been introduced to eliminate answer bias by using randomization processes and probabilistic theory to obscure the respondent’s answer and create anonymity, thus facilitating honest answers. The probably most traditional method is the Randomized Response Technique by Warner (1965). However, this method is loaded with certain disadvantages. Therefore, in the last decade, newer methods were introduced that aim at balancing the disadvantages and weaknesses of previous methods, for instance, the non-randomized models Crosswise Model and Triangular Model (Yu et al. 2008) as well as the Parallel Model (Tian 2014). Although especially the Triangular Model is easy to implement in a study, there is only little empirical evidence on its application in different survey modes and populations. Further, it is to assume that certain questions are not equally sensitive for everybody due to specific personal characteristics. Thus, indirect questioning might not be effective in general but only for certain populations. The present study extends prior work on the Triangular Model by evaluating it for different subgroups. The conducted experiment asks for sensitive characteristics in the context of mental stress among students. The Triangular Model achieves significantly higher percentages than conventional direct questioning for illegal drug use among persons that answer socially desirable according to the characteristic of Self-Deception. For the other analyzed subgroups (Impression Management, gender, and depressiveness), the Triangular Model could not achieve higher prevalence rates compared to direct questioning on a sufficient probability level. But still, hard evidence on the effectiveness of indirect questioning models is thin and further critical discussion is needed.",60015595,Universität Bielefeld,Bielefeld,Germany,['1706'],19.714285714285715,0.03583333333333333,0.4873280423280423,1

For semantic segmentation in particular, it helps deploy on real 'target domain' data models that are trained on annotated images from a different 'source domain', notably a virtual environment. To this end, most previous works consider semantic segmentation as the only mode of supervision for source domain data, while ignoring other, possibly available, information like depth. In this work, we aim at exploiting at best such a privileged information while training the UDA model. We propose a unified depth-aware UDA framework that leverages in several complementary ways the knowledge of dense depth in the source domain.

Subsequently, a novel surrogate model-based optimation strategy was proposed to obtain a relatively light mass missile structure under existing shape size. Eventually, different missile models were used to verify the validity of the method.

An algebraic method based on the study parameters of the special Euclidean transformation Lie group SE(3) was used to determine the mechanism kinematics singularities and workspace. Moreover, two particular medical tool manipulations for the minimally invasive medical procedures are defined in terms of the Study parameters. The first manipulation of the medical tool refers to the linear insertion (of e.g., needles) and the second one is the remote center of motion manipulation of specific medical instruments (e.g., ultrasound probes). The constraint equations of the robotic system are derived and then, the operational workspace is illustrated for the novel parallel robotic system.

755,755,Second-order sliding mode formation control of multiple robots by extreme learning machine,"This paper addresses a second-order sliding mode control method for the formation problem of multirobot systems. The formation patterns are usually symmetrical. This sliding mode control is based on the super-twisting law. In many real-world applications, the robots suffer from a great diversity of uncertainties and disturbances that greatly challenge super-twisting sliding mode formation maneuvers. In particular, such a challenge has adverse effects on the formation performance when the uncertainties and disturbances have an unknown bound. This paper focuses on this issue and utilizes the technique of an extreme learning machine to meet this challenge. Within the leader-follower framework, this paper investigates the integration of the super-twisting sliding mode control method and the extreme learning machine. The output weights of this extreme learning machine are adaptively adjusted so that this integrated formation design has guaranteed closed-loop stability in the sense of Lyaponov. In the end, some simulations are implemented via a multirobot platform, illustrating the superiority and effectiveness of the integrated formation design in spite of uncertainties and disturbances.",60021227,North China Electric Power University,Beijing,China,['1701'],18.77777777777778,0.15416666666666665,0.6683333333333333,1

759,759,Planning the schedule for the disposal of the spent nuclear fuel with interactive multiobjective optimization,"Several countries utilize nuclear power and face the problem of what to do with the spent nuclear fuel. One possibility, which is under the scope in this paper, is to dispose of the fuel assemblies in the disposal facility. Before the assemblies can be disposed of, they must cool down their decay heat power in the interim storage. Next, they are loaded into canisters in the encapsulation facility, and finally, the canisters are placed in the disposal facility. In this paper, we model this process as a nonsmooth multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem with the minimization of nine objectives: the maximum number of assemblies in the storage, maximum storage time, average storage time, total number of canisters, end time of the encapsulation, operation time of the encapsulation facility, the lengths of disposal and central tunnels, and total costs. As a result, we obtain the disposal schedule i.e., amount of canisters disposed of periodically. We introduce the interactive multiobjective optimization method using the two-slope parameterized achievement scalarizing functions which enables us to obtain systematically several different Pareto optimal solutions from the same preference information. Finally, a case study adapting the disposal in Finland is given.

However, in conventional broadcast approaches, only one data item can be retrieved by clients in one broadcast tick. To further improve the efficiency of wireless bandwidth, in this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on incorporating network coding with representative on-demand scheduling algorithms while preserving their original scheduling criteria. In particular, a graph model is derived to maximize the coding benefit based on the clients' requested and cached data items. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic coding-based approach, which is applicable for all the on-demand scheduling algorithms with low computational complexity. In addition, based on various application requirements, we classify the existing on-demand scheduling algorithms into three groups-real-time, non-real-time and stretch optimal. In view of different application-specific objectives, we implement the coding versions of representative algorithms in each group.

762,762,Study on adaptive cruise control strategy for battery electric vehicle considering weight adjustment,"This paper studies control strategies for adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). A hierarchical control structure is adopted for the ACC system, and the structure contains an upper controller and a lower controller. This paper focuses on the upper controller. In the upper controller, model predictive control (MPC) is applied for optimizing multiple objectives in the car-following process. In addition, multiple objectives, including safety, tracking, comfort, and energy economy, can be transformed into a symmetric objective function with constraints in MPC. In the objective function, the corresponding weight matrix for the optimization of multiple objectives is implemented in symmetric form to reduce the computational complexity. The weights in the weight matrix are usually set to be constant. However, the motion states of the own vehicle and the front vehicle change with respect to time during a car-following process, resulting in variation of the driving conditions. MPCs with constant weights do not adapt well to changes in driving conditions, which limits the performance of the ACC system. Therefore, a strategy for weight adjustment is proposed in order to improve the tracking performance, in which some weights in MPC can be adjusted according to the relative velocity of two vehicles in real time. The simulation experiments are carried out to demonstrate the eectiveness of the strategy for weight adjustment. Based on achieving the other control objectives, the ACC system with the weight adjustment has better tracking performance than the ACC system with the constant weight. While the tracking is improved, the energy economy is also improved.",60029306,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,['1701'],19.846153846153847,0.054411764705882354,0.21323529411764708,1
763,763,Responding to socially desirable and undesirable topics: Different types of response behaviour?,"Social desirability describes the tendency of respondents to present themselves in a more positive light than is accurate and is a serious concern in surveys. If researchers are better able to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for social desirability bias, they may be able to devise ways to identify and correct for it. One possibility involves determining whether social desirability is more of a deliberate ‘editing’ of responses or an automatic, perhaps ‘self-deceptive’, act. Then researchers could potentially flag conspicuously fast or slow responses to improve data quality. We outline dual-process-related theoretical arguments for both scenarios and test their plausibility using data gathered in a tablet-based CASI survey of pre-service teachers in Germany that were asked to assess their suitability for their chosen profession. Our analysis involves the use of fixed-effects multilevel models that enable us to control for unobserved differences between respondent- and item-characteristics while also examining cross-level interactions between the predictors at various levels. Specifically, we examine the classic respondent- (i.e. need for social approval) and item-related characteristics (i.e. trait desirability) associated with social desirability bias, as well as the speed at which the respondents gave their answers. Doing so allows us to observe under what circumstances the respondents tended to overstate positive characteristics as well as understate negative ones. We find evidence for social desirability as an automatic as well as a deliberate response behaviour. However, the mechanism responsible for determining whether social desirability occurs automatically or deliberately seems to be whether the item content is desirable or undesirable. Desirable traits seem to elicit faster socially desirable responses whereas undesirable traits seem to elicit slower socially desirable responses.",60008069,Technische Universität Chemnitz,Chemnitz,Germany,['1706'],20.846153846153847,0.13406478578892372,0.36922675026123286,1

768,768,Evolution of residual stress based on curvature coupling in multi-roll levelling," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Residual stress is the main cause of flatness defects in sheet metal and the basic method to improve the shape quality of the sheet is to reduce and eliminate the residual stress by multi-roll levelling. The curvature coupling between repeated sheet bendings in multi-roll levelling greatly affects the accuracy of the analysis of the residual stress evolution, which is rarely considered in current research. Aiming to address this problem, a method for eliminating residual stress by multi-roll levelling based on curvature coupling is discussed in this article. An evaluation criterion and an analysis model are proposed to investigate the evolution of the residual stress in multi-roll levelling considering the curvature coupling between bendings. The effects of the intermesh of the work rolls and the plastic deformation of the sheet on the residual stress are also discussed. The results show that multi-roll levelling will cause rolling residual stress while reducing the initial residual stress of the sheet and the larger plastic deformation caused by the intermesh of the work rolls at the entry is beneficial for the complete elimination of the initial residual stress, but the rolling residual stress will increase at the same time. Therefore, the total residual stress of the sheet after levelling depends on the appropriate levelling parameters.",60117982,State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power and Mechatronic System,Hangzhou,China,['1706'],30.571428571428573,0.15555555555555556,0.3986111111111111,0

Moreover, the critic model facilitates the interpretation of the effectiveness of the attention mechanism during the learning process, by estimating the quality of the attention maps. Specifically, we jointly train our attention agent and critic in a reinforcement learning manner, where the agent produces the visual attention while the critic analyzes the gain from the attention and guides the agent to maximize this gain. We design spatial- and channel-wise attention models with our critic module and evaluate them on three popular benchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and CUHK03.

777,777,Gravitational instability caused by theweight of heat,"Thermal energy points towards a disordered, completely uniform state act to counter gravity's tendency to generate order and structure through gravitational collapse. It is, therefore, expected to contribute to the stabilization of a self-gravitating, classical ideal gas over collapse. However, I identified an instability that always occurs at sufficiently high energies: the high-energy or relativistic gravothermal instability. I argue here that this instability presents an analogous core-halo structure as its Newtonian counterpart, the Antonov instability. The main difference is that in the former case the core is dominated by the gravitation of thermal energy and not rest mass energy. A relativistic generalization of Antonov's instability-the low-energy gravothermal instability-also occurs. The two turning points, which make themselves evident as a double spiral of the caloric curve, approach each other as relativistic effects become more intense and eventually merge in a single point. Thus, the high and low-energy cases may be realized as two aspects of a single phenomenon-the gravothermal instability-which involves a core-halo separation and an intrinsic heat flow. Finally, I argue that the core formed during a core-collapse supernova is subject to the relativistic gravothermal instability if it becomes sufficiently hot and compactified at the time of the bounce. In this case, it will continue to collapse towards the formation of a black hole.",60023356,The British University in Egypt,El Shorouk,Egypt,['1701'],21.4,0.1044987468671679,0.44124060150375943,1

780,780,StreamflowVL: A virtual fieldwork laboratory that supports traditional hydraulics engineering learning," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper describes an innovative virtual laboratory for students of Hydraulic Engineering at an Italian university that shows water discharge measurement techniques applied in open-channel flows. Such new technology, which supports traditional practical classes, has the potential to increase students' motivation and improve their skills, as well as simultaneously reducing the costs, time, and possible dangers that continuous field experiments would involve. Thanks to this immersive and interactive experience that is carried out indoors, students learn to move around a fluvial environment, as well as work more safely and with reduced risks of accidents. Besides, the virtual lab can boost learners' interest by combining education with pleasure and making knowledge more fun. Collaboration with a group of students enrolled in the Master's degree course of the Civil and Environmental Engineering program at Basilicata University at the early stages of developing the educational tool led to improvements in its performance and features. Also, a preliminary testing procedure carried out on a student sample, verified the achievement of the students' learning objectives in terms of knowledge and skills. Such analysis indicated that students took more active role in the teaching/learning process and they showed greater interest in the topic dealt with through the new technology compared to the involvement of students observed during traditional lessons in previous years. The architecture and operational modes of the virtual laboratory as well as the results of the preliminary analysis are discussed.",60020919,Università degli Studi della Basilicata,Potenza,Italy,['1706'],30.0,0.18203463203463205,0.505988455988456,0

The pressure sensing elements were constructed as Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometers of different cavity lengths using pairs of FBGs with identical resonant wavelength. In this fashion an interference pattern was formed within the FBG bandwidth with much narrower fringes, leading to better detection limit. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) was used to calculate the phase change of the FP interference pattern with respect to applied pressure. The pressure sensitivity was proportional to the cavity FP cavity length, and reached-0.672 rad/MPa for the case of FP with 9 mm cavity length.

The world industrial producers cultivate the four main varieties of peanuts (Spanish, Valencia, Virginia, and Runner), which have different types and subspecies, whose names may vary in some countries. These varieties differ in structure, chemical composition, nutritional and biological value, as well as in the areas of industrial use. Problem Statement. At present, there is no scientific approach to the rational use of peanuts in specific technologies of food industry, which would take into account its varietal properties and chemical composition. The development of such a technique will significantly reduce the loss of raw materials, improve the quality of peanut processing products, and increase the efficiency of production. Purpose. To make a cluster analysis to find ways for rational use of peanut varieties adapted for cultivation in Ukraine and to develop appropriate recommendations for the food industry. Materials and Methods. Nineteen varieties of peanuts have been used in the collection of the Institute of Oilseeds of the NAAS of Ukraine (Zaporizhzhіa). The cluster analysis method has been used to process the research results and to classify the peanut varieties. Results. Peanut quality criteria have been developed for choosing an optimal usage (protein content and its biological value, lipid and oleic acid content, oxalate index, and content of contaminants). Depending on the usage, the peanut varieties have been classified into the three groups: for manufacturing peanut oil, for processing into peanut paste, and for manufacturing halva, chocolates, cakes, and snack products. The recommendations allow different manufacturers to choose an optimal usage and to use peanuts for producing high quality products in a more efficient way. Conclusions. The developed quality criteria can be used as basis for the definition and development of the principles of rational use of peanuts given their specific properties and are useful for technologists, commodity researchers, breeders, geneticists, pharmacologists, physicians, and so on.

Today, we can use phrase “the world's first” for many inventions of Ukrainian scientists. Ukraine is a country with a high level of science development. As a proof of this statement, one may take the international recognition of achievements made by Ukrainian scientists in different areas of technology. Problem Statement. Ukraine aspires to become an equal member of the European Union. It is important that Ukrainians do not lose their national identity in this direction of movement. Disseminating knowledge about Ukrainian scientists is one of the ways to increase Ukraine's recognition in the world. That is why it is necessary to demonstrate to the world community the achievements of Ukrainian scientists and their high scientific level. Purpose. The research is aimed at justifying importance of Ukrainian scientists' works for the development of technology in the world. Materials and Methods. The analytical review of the works of Ukrainian scientists that have the great importance for the development of technology in the world, was carried out. Results. The importance of Ukrainian scientists' works in photography, cinematograph, electric welding, computer technology, aviation, astronomy, rocket science and astronautics has been proved. Ukrainian scientists were among the first in the invention of television, electric tram and radio control. Thanks to the work of our compatriots, it became possible to launch the first artificial satellite of the Earth, to make the flight of man to space, the exit of man in open space and landing on the surface of the Moon. Conclusions. Priority of Ukrainian scientists' works in many researches testifies to their significant contribution to the development of world technologies. Coverage of this contribution should by no means ignite interethnic animosity, but it can serve as an incentive to realize the national identity of Ukrainians in the context of world integration. The main principle is that science should unite peoples, and be the foundation of peace in the world.

The fibre laser is a simple Fabry Perot cavity with Erbium and thulium doped sections that provide optical gain and saturable absorption respectively. We explore methodically laser behaviour for consecutive up and down scans of optical pump powers for up to 13 unique experimental configurations using different lengths of the absorber section (ranging from 0.21 m to 1.48 m).

789,789,Flexural and shear performance of prestressed composite slabs with inverted multi-ribs,"Half precast concrete slabs with inverted multi-ribs (Joint Advanced Slab, JAS), which enhance composite performance between slabs by introducing shear keys at connections between the slabs and improve structural performance by placing prestressing tendons and truss-type shear reinforcements, have recently been developed and applied in many construction fields. In this study, flexural and shear tests were performed to verify the structural performance of JAS members. Towards this end, two flexural specimens and four shear specimens were fabricated, and the presence of cast-in-place concrete and the location of the critical section were set as the main test variables. In addition, the flexural and shear performance of the JAS was quantitatively evaluated using a non-linear flexural analysis model and current structural design codes. Evaluation results confirmed that the flexural behavior of the JAS was almost similar to the behavior simulated through the non-linear flexural analysis model, and the shear performance of the JAS can also be estimated appropriately by using the shear strength equations presented in the current design codes. For the JAS with cast-in-place concrete, however, the shear strength estimation results differed significantly depending on the way that the shear contributions of the precast concrete unit and cast-in-place concrete were calculated. Based on the analysis results, this study proposed a design method that can reasonably estimate the shear strength of the composite JAS.",60027652,University of Seoul,Seoul,South Korea,['1706'],31.714285714285715,0.16125,0.4687500000000001,1

792,792,Dynamic partitioning supporting load balancing for distributed RDF graph stores,Various resource description framework (RDF) partitioning methods have been studied for the effcient distributed processing of a large RDF graph. The RDF graph has symmetrical characteristics because subject and object can be used interchangeably if predicate is changed. This paper proposes a dynamic partitioning method of RDF graphs to support load balancing in distributed environments where data insertion and change continue to occur. The proposed method generates clusters and subclusters by considering the usage frequency of the RDF graph that are used by queries as the criteria to perform graph partitioning. It creates a cluster by grouping RDF subgraphs with higher usage frequency while creating a subcluster with lower usage frequency. These clusters and subclusters conduct load balancing by using the mean frequency of queries for the distributed server and conduct graph data partitioning by considering the size of the data stored in each distributed server. It also minimizes the number of edge-cuts connected to clusters and subclusters to minimize communication costs between servers. This solves the problem of data concentration to specific servers due to ongoing data changes and additions and allows ecient load balancing among servers. The performance results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing partitioning methods in terms of query performance time in a distributed server.,60004739,Chungbuk National University,Cheongju,South Korea,['1701'],23.555555555555557,0.026124338624338623,0.443452380952381,1

795,795,"Behavioral intentions, actual behavior and the role of personality traits. Evidence from a Factorial Survey among Female Labor Market Re-entrants","Factorial surveys (FS) are used frequently to draw conclusions about behavior. However, in FS only behavioral intentions are measured and answering fictive situations are likely to be connected with individual personality traits. Therefore, it is unclear to what extent behavioral intentions as measured by FS and actual behavior are related. It is also unclear whether and how personality traits influence intentions and actual behavior. This paper addresses this subject matter by analyzing these research questions. The theory of planned behavior serves as the theoretical basis (Ajzen, 1991). The research questions are addressed with data from a factorial survey collected among 395 prospective female labor market re-entrants. They were asked about their willingness to accept lower wages if compensated by “positive” nonmonetary job characteristics. A follow-up study after one year also included information on actual behavior, i.e., whether the woman has found a job. The analysis reveals that women who are willing to accept “negative” job characteristics are more likely to re-enter employment, suggesting a high correlation between results from the factorial survey and actual behavior and thus external validity. Furthermore, personality traits only have a minor influence on behavioral intentions and behavior. This confounds previous non-experimental research results. However, some individual effects are different in the intentions and behavioral model, which also indicates differences between experimental and real-world settings.",60000765,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,Erlangen,Germany,['1706'],16.846153846153847,0.026157575757575758,0.4280848484848484,1

By using Improved Single Cleavage Semi-Circle (ISCSC) specimens and Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar equipment, experiments were conducted, with the fracture phenomenon and crack propagation of tight sandstone investigated. Meanwhile, the process of crack propagation behaviour was simulated. Moreover, with the experimental-numerical method, the crack propagation dynamic stress intensity factor (DSIF) was also calculated. Then, the crack propagation toughness of tight sandstone under different loading rates was investigated and illustrated elaborately. Investigation results demonstrate that ISCSC specimens can achieve the crack arrest position unchanged, and the numerical simulation could effectively deduce the actual crack propagation, as their results were well matched. During crack propagation, the crack propagation DSIF in the whole process increases with the rising loading rate, and so does the crack propagation velocity.

Computer programs (CP) are one of the newest objects of intellectual property. Neither the norms of copyright or patent law, nor attempts to develop separate legislation have enabled creating a legal mechanism that would not cause significant complaints from stakeholders. Problem Statement. An analysis of the historical factors that led to the choice of different approaches to the legal protection of computer programs enables to better understand the system in each country, to choose the most appropriate ways to acquire the rights and protection of these objects of intellectual property, to defend their property and non-property rights, and to look for new, more reasonable and efficient ways of solving problems in this field. Purpose. To study the world history of the formation and development of legal protection of computer software by the rules of copyright and patent law. Materials and Methods. Critical review of literary sources on intellectual property and computer science, comparative analysis of international and national legislation of various countries, study of judicial practice that has had the greatest impact on the practical solution to the problem of protecting computer programs. Results. The main stages in the history of the development and formation of ways of legal protection of computer programs have been identified and characterized. Intellectual property and computer sciences materials, international and national legislation of different countries, jurisprudence, the most important historical events and outstanding inventions in this field have been analyzed. The dominant position of the computer program copyright protection has been established not always to correspond with the rights and interests of their authors who increasingly support the introduction of alternati¬ve, patent and legal protection of computer programs by special legislation rather than by the precedent law.

In this work, we equip the adversarial network with a 'significance-aware information bottleneck (SIB)', to address the above problem. The new network structure, called SIBAN, enables a significance-aware feature purification before the adversarial adaptation, which eases the feature alignment and stabilizes the adversarial training course. In two domain adaptation tasks, i.e., GTA5 -> Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes, we validate that the proposed method can yield leading results compared with other feature-space alternatives.

800,800,Cover the violence: A novel deep-learning-based approach towards violence-detection in movies," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Movies have become one of the major sources of entertainment in the current era, which are based on diverse ideas. Action movies have received the most attention in last few years, which contain violent scenes, because it is one of the undesirable features for some individuals that is used to create charm and fantasy. However, these violent scenes have had a negative impact on kids, and they are not comfortable even for mature age people. The best way to stop under aged people from watching violent scenes in movies is to eliminate these scenes. In this paper, we proposed a violence detection scheme for movies that is comprised of three steps. First, the entire movie is segmented into shots, and then a representative frame from each shot is selected based on the level of saliency. Next, these selected frames are passed from a light-weight deep learning model, which is fine-tuned using a transfer learning approach to classify violence and non-violence shots in a movie. Finally, all the non-violence scenes are merged in a sequence to generate a violence-free movie that can be watched by children and as well violence paranoid people. The proposed model is evaluated on three violence benchmark datasets, and it is experimentally proved that the proposed scheme provides a fast and accurate detection of violent scenes in movies compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",60027884,Sejong University,Seoul,South Korea,['1706'],25.555555555555557,-0.05597826086956521,0.5068840579710144,0

The pseudo-AlInGaN barriers consist of two In0.16Ga0.84N(11 Å) sandwiched by three Al0.064Ga0.936N (15 Å). The equivalent indium and aluminum compositions in pseudo-AlInGaN barrier are 0.043 and 0.052, respectively, which can be calculated by volume ratio. For reference purpose, In0.16Ga0.84N/GaN MQWs was also used. To generate surface acoustic wave, interdigital patterns with 1 μm finger width were fabricated by e-beam lithography. The piezoelectric fields for GaN barrier and pseudo- Al0.043In0.052Ga0.905N barrier samples are found to be 1.5 MV/cm, 0.33 MV/cm from bias-PL. From μ-PL measurement for pseudo-Al0.043In0.052Ga0.905N barrier sample, we observed lowest luminescence intensity at 100 MHz and 13 dBm in radio frequency (RF) generator, which means that electron-hole recombination can be suppressed by SAWs. The Photocurrent measurement for pseudo-Al0.043In0.052Ga0.905N barrier sample was observed increasing around 2 orders of magnitude at 100 MHz when compare to GaN barrier sample.

Relative reflectance as a function of wavelength gives no insight into the fraction of the intensity of light that falls on a spider silk that will be backscattered/reflected into a solid angle such that it might result in it being visible to an oncoming insect, for example. We will report comparative results from measurements of the radial silks of four orb web weaving spider species. These species evolved at different times and/or to exploit different biological habits. One species is nocturnal. Combining the results of photoreflectance measurements and optical surface profiling studies shows how the geometry of the spider silks may have evolved to reduce the scattered/reflected light from the radial silk of certain species. The properties of certain spider silks as an optical material with low UV absorption also emerge from this study.",60028333,University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia,Sydney,Australia,['1706'],25.75,0.09928571428571428,0.4239285714285714,0

804,804,An efficient dynamic load balancing scheme based on nash bargaining in SDN,"Static multi-controller deployment architecture cannot adapt to the drastic changes of network traffic, which will lead to a load imbalance between controllers, resulting in a high packet loss rate, high latency, and other network performance degradation problems. In this paper, an efficient dynamic load balancing scheme based on Nash bargaining is proposed for a distributed software-defined network. Firstly, considering the connectivity of network nodes, the switch migration problem is transformed into a network mapping relationship reconstruction problem. Then, we establish the Nash bargaining game model to fairly optimize the two contradictory goals of migration cost and load balance. Finally, the model is solved by an improved firefly algorithm, and the optimal network mapping state is obtained. The experimental results show that this scheme can optimize the migration cost and load balance at the same time. Compared with the existing research schemes, the migration process of the switch is optimized, and, while effectively balancing the load of the control plane, the migration cost is reduced by 14.5%.",60138441,Tianjin Chengjian University,Tianjin,China,['1705'],23.714285714285715,0.16208333333333336,0.54,1

The primary benefit of this type of tactile display is its potential for high resolution. This paper presents the concept of the proposed system and human skin contact experiments to explore user perception challenges related to beam vibration during skin contact. The human skin contact experiments can be described in five phases: dried skin contact to metal beam tips, wet and soaped skin contact to metal beam tips, skin contact with a constraint, normal force measurement, and skin contact to the tips of silicone rubber beams attached to metal beam tips. Experimental results are analyzed to determine in what cases of skin contact the beams stop vibrating. It is found that the addition of silicone rubber beams allows the primary metal beams to continue vibrating while in contact with skin. Thus, the vibration response of a metal beam with silicone rubber beams is investigated for the better understanding of the effect of silicone rubber beams on the metal beam vibration.",60004372,Arizona State University Polytechnic Campus,Mesa,United States,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",26.571428571428573,0.11750000000000001,0.4741666666666667,0

It is generally agreed that by adding something fun to the learning process students become more engaged and, consequently, retain more knowledge. However, although the characteristics of video games facilitate the dynamics of the educational process it is necessary to plan a pedagogical project that includes delimitation of learning goals and profile of the addressees, the conditions of application of the educational project, and the methodologies of evaluation of the learning progress. This is how we can make a real difference between gamification and video game based learning. The paper addresses the design of an educational resource for special education needs (SEN) students that aims to help teach communicative skills related to prosody. The technological choices made to support the pedagogic issues that underlie the educational product, the strategies to convert learning content into playful material, and the methodology to obtain measures of its playability and effectiveness are described.

The models of discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) in free-space seawater channel are briefly described, and the performance of the four-state protocol and the eight-state protocol in asymptotic and finite-size cases is analyzed in detail. Simulation results illustrate that the more complex is the seawater composition, the worse is the performance of the protocol. For different types of seawater channels, we can improve the performance of the protocol by selecting different optimal modulation variances and controlling the extra noise on the channel. Besides, we can find that the performance of the eight-state protocol is better than that of the four-state protocol, and there is little difference between homodyne detection and heterodyne detection. Although the secret key rate of the protocol that we propose is still relatively low and the maximum transmission distance is only a few hundred meters, the research on CV-QKD over the seawater channel is of great significance, which provides a new idea for the construction of global secure communication network.",60017060,Central South University,Changsha,China,['1706'],31.0,0.04244318181818182,0.5318939393939394,0

815,815,High precision measurement of optical absorption in low-OH fused silica at 2 micron," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.The first detection of gravitational waves from a binary black hole inspiral by LIGO in September 2015 heralded the beginning of a new age in gravitational wave astronomy. The detection of a binary neutron inspiral in August 2017 and has now opened up a new era of multi-messenger astronomy. To increase the sensitivity of future gravitational wave detectors, a change to cryogenic silicon test masses and an increase in laser power may be required. Silicon is a compelling choice as it has high thermal conductivity at cryo-genic temperatures, which reduces temperature gradients generated by optical absorption. Additionally, at 123 K, its thermal expansion coefficient crosses zero. Thus, near this temperature, thermo-elastic distortion of the mirror surface should be drastically reduced, as would the effect of thermo-elastic noise due to thermodynamic temperature fluctuations. However, the adoption of silicon for the optical substrates would necessitate a shift of operating wavelength from 1064 nm to >1.3 μm where silicon is transparent. While potential wavelengths include ca. 1.55 μm and 2.0 μm, the longer wavelengths may be preferred due to lower scattering loss and coating absorption.",60009512,The University of Adelaide,Adelaide,Australia,['1706'],21.333333333333332,0.0555050505050505,0.44922979797979795,0

Convolutional Neural Networks with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM) can be applied in this business field, in order to generate workplace procedures. To overcome the problem of usefully acquiring and sharing specialist knowledge, we use CNN-SVM to examine features from video material concerning each work activity for further comparison with the instruction picture's features. (2) Methods: This paper uses literature studies and a selected workplace procedure: repairing a solid and using a fuel boiler as the benchmark dataset, which contains 20 s of training and a test video, in order to provide a reference model of features for a workplace procedure. In this model, the method used is also known as Convolutional Neural Networks with Support Vector Machine. This method effectively determines features for the further comparison and detection of objects. (3) Results: The innovative model for generating a workplace procedure, using CNN-SVM architecture, once built, can then be used to provide a learning process to the employees of manufacturing companies. The novelty of the proposed methodology is its architecture, which combines the acquisition of specialist knowledge and formalising and recording it in a useful form for new employees in the company. Moreover, three new algorithms were created: an algorithm to match features, an algorithm to detect each activity in the workplace procedure, and an algorithm to generate an activity scenario. (4) Conclusions: The effciency of the proposed methodology can be demonstrated on a dataset comprising a collection of workplace procedures, such as the repair of the solid fuel boiler.

In the present paper, we address mainly the self-similarity in the limit of early stage, as opposed to the latter one, and also consider the scaling functions that decay or grow algebraically, as opposed to the rapidly decaying functions such as Gaussian or error function. In particular, in the case of simple diffusion, our symmetry analysis shows a mathematical mechanism by which the rapidly decaying scaling functions are generated by other polynomial scaling functions. While the former is adapted to the self-similarity in the late-stage processes, the latter is adapted to the early stages. This paper sheds some light on the internal structure of the family of self-similarities generated by a simple diffusion equation. Then, we present an example of self-similarity for the late stage whose scaling function has power-law tail, and also several cases of self-similarity for the early stages. These examples show the utility of self-similarity to a wider range of phenomena other than the late stage behaviors with rapidly decaying scaling functions.",60123695,Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes,Paris,France,['1701'],27.428571428571427,0.008730158730158729,0.25861678004535144,1

The effectiveness and rationality of shaping such free forms and the creativeness in searching for the parametric forms require the application of their regular and symmetric models which have to be derived from the geometric and mechanical properties of the rationally transformed subsequent folds of these shells. Simplified smooth models used for engineering developments and accurate folded models implemented for scientific research have to be created by means of unconventional methods different from those presented in classical courses. Owing to the variety of the forms of the proposed innovative reference tetrahedrons and their parametric description, the algorithms developed by the authors have to be implemented in computer programs. The rationality of the transformed roof shells, revealed in the limitation of the level of the fold's initial stresses resulting from the shape transformation, and the attractiveness of these forms are achieved by the axial symmetry and contraction of each shell fold at its half-length.

Measurement of below-Threshold emission spectra identifies the bandgap as well as band-edge modes. The bandgap separation, which is a function of feedback coupling, increases with increasing depth. From within, the Bragg frequencies and their detuning from lasing frequencies can be determined. Moreover, with increasing depth, the threshold pumping density decreases exponentially to a saturation level, which is assigned to minimum device modal gain of certain value.

While optical fibers can provide spatial information along their length through distributed and multi-point sensing techniques, operation at such temperatures is an area of ongoing research and development. A challenge is that conventional optical fibers, fabricated with a chemically doped core, suffer dopant diffusion at these high temperatures, ultimately limiting their operating lifespan.

827,827,Identifying availability tactics to support security architectural design of microservice-based systems,"Microservices is an architectural style that considers systems as modular, customer-centric, independent, and scalable suite of services. In order to address security requirements in microservices-based systems, architects often must focus on critical quality attributes, such as availability, aiming at employing architectural solutions that provide design decisions that address key security concerns (also known as architectural tactics). Although current architectural tactics for availability offer an extensive catalog of alternatives to improve availability and security factors, new availability concerns (emerging from security microservices requirements) demand new or improved architectural tactics. In this article, we examined the source code and documentation of 17 open source microservices-based systems, identified 5 uses of availability tactics, and characterized them using a newly introduced descriptive template. We found that almost all (4 out of 5) tactics did focus on preventing faults rather than detecting, mitigating or recovering from them (which are the traditional tactics taxonomies' branches). This approach can be further used to systematically identify and characterize architectural tactics in existing microservices-based systems in other critical quality attributes concerning security, such as confidentiality and integrity.",60007087,Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María,Valparaíso,Chile,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",29.666666666666668,0.018939393939393936,0.5297979797979797,1

Existing work has shown how to exploit models of pushing to achieve a variety of tasks, including grasping under uncertainty, in-hand manipulation and clearing clutter. Such models, however, are approximate, which limits their applicability.Learning-based methods can reason directly from raw sensory data with accuracy, and have the potential to generalize to a wider diversity of scenarios. However, developing and testing such methods requires rich-enough datasets. In this paper we introduce Omnipush, a dataset with high variety of planar pushing behavior.In particular, we provide 250 pushes for each of 250 objects, all recorded with RGB-D and a high precision tracking system.

830,830,Semantic data management for a virtual factory collaborative environment," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Recent developments in the area of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and Internet of Things (IoT) are among the drivers for the emergence of the Industry 4.0 concept, setting new requirements for the architecture, technology, and design approaches of modern industrial systems. Industry 4.0 assumes a higher level of intelligence, and thus autonomy of the systems and subsystems, and a larger focus on the analysis of gathered data for further utilization. The Virtual Factory Open Operating System (vf-OS) project is intended to respond to some of these key challenges, in particular for the smart factory application domain. Complementarily, data and knowledge storage and processing are also in the scope of vf-OS. This article introduces the semantic management component of vf-OS, which aims to analyze the interrelations among stored entities, as well as to define the closeness among them to generate meaningful suggestions, which can be later used by other subsystems or operators in a user-friendly way. The semantic managing system makes use of non relational approaches, namely a graph database, which enables data to be represented as graphs for further semantic querying. The developed prototype and an illustrative application case are also presented.",60005315,Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias,Caparica,Portugal,['1706'],27.857142857142858,0.10302257266542982,0.4575525664811379,0
831,831,Privacy preserving image queries for camera localization,"Augmented/mixed reality and robotic applications are increasingly relying on cloud-based localization services, which require users to upload query images to perform camera pose estimation on a server. This raises significant privacy concerns when consumers use such services in their homes or in confidential industrial settings. Even if only image features are uploaded, the privacy concerns remain as the images can be reconstructed fairly well from feature locations and descriptors. We propose to conceal the content of the query images from an adversary on the server or a man-in-the-middle intruder. The key insight is to replace the 2D image feature points in the query image with randomly oriented 2D lines passing through their original 2D positions. It will be shown that this feature representation hides the image contents, and thereby protects user privacy, yet still provides sufficient geometric constraints to enable robust and accurate 6-DOF camera pose estimation from feature correspondences. Our proposed method can handle single- and multi-image queries as well as exploit additional information about known structure, gravity, and scale. Numerous experiments demonstrate the high practical relevance of our approach.",60026532,Microsoft Corporation,Redmond,United States,"['1712', '1707']",22.625,0.11154761904761905,0.6343849206349207,1
832,832,Feature selection of grey wolf optimizer based on quantum computing and uncertain symmetry rough set,"Considering the crucial influence of feature selection on data classification accuracy, a grey wolf optimizer based on quantum computing and uncertain symmetry rough set (QCGWORS) was proposed. QCGWORS was to apply a parallel of three theories to feature selection, and each of them owned the unique advantages of optimizing feature selection algorithm. Quantum computing had a good balance ability when exploring feature sets between global and local searches. Grey wolf optimizer could effectively explore all possible feature subsets, and uncertain symmetry rough set theory could accurately evaluate the correlation of potential feature subsets. QCGWORS intelligent algorithm could minimize the number of features while maximizing classification performance. In the experimental stage, k nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier and random forest (RF) classifier guided the machine learning process of the proposed algorithm, and 13 datasets were compared for testing experiments. Experimental results showed that compared with other feature selection methods, QCGWORS improved the classification accuracy on 12 datasets, among which the best accuracy was increased by 20.91%.

833,833,Maximal Augmented Zagreb Index of Trees with at Most Three Branching Vertices,"The Augmented Zagreb index of a graph G is defined to be AZI(G) = ∑uvϵE(G)(d(u) d(v)d(u) +d(v)-2)3, where E(G) is the edge set of G, d (u) and d(v) are the degrees of the vertices u and v of edge uv. It is one of the most valuable topological indices used to predict the structure-property correlations of organic compounds. It is well known that the star is the unique tree having minimal AZI among trees. However, the problem of finding the tree with maximal AZI is still open and seems to be a very difficult problem. A recent conjecture, posed in the recent paper [IEEE Access, vol. 6, pp. 69335-69341, 2018], states that the balanced double star is the tree with maximal AZI among all trees with n vertices, for all n ≥ 19. Let Ω(n,p) be the set of trees with n vertices and p branching vertices. In this paper we consider the maximal value problem of AZI over Ω(n,p). We first show that under a certain condition, the problem reduces to finding the maximal value of AZI over Ω1 (n,p), the set of trees in Ω(n,p) with no vertices of degree 2. Then we rely on this result to find the trees with maximal value of AZI over Ω (n,p), when p=2 and 3. In particular, we deduce that the conjecture holds for all trees with at most 3 branching vertices.",60055833,Universidad de Antioquia,Medellin,Colombia,['1700'],19.416666666666668,0.10466269841269842,0.4865079365079364,1

This research aimed to make contributions to the design of secure block cipher in the ideal cipher model whose underlying primitive is a family of n-bit to n-bit random permutations indexed by secret key. Our target construction of a secure block ciphers denoted as E[s] is built on a simple XOR operation and two block cipher invocations, under the assumptions that the block cipher in use is a pseudorandom permutation. One out of these two block cipher invocations produce a subkey that is derived from the secret key. It has been accepted that at least two block cipher invocations with XOR operations are required to achieve beyond birthday bound security. In this paper, we investigated the E[s] instances with the advanced proof technique and efficient block cipher constructions that bypass the birthday-bound up to 2n provable security was achieved. Our study provided new insights to the block cipher that is beyond birthday bound security.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,['1701'],24.857142857142858,0.11575757575757575,0.6907792207792209,1

The sensor we proposed is composed of two line-based interferometers, which are multiplexed with super luminescent diode (SLD), interference unit (IU) and SF respectively through wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) to obtain different wavelength disturbance signals generated by the same disturbance. Two signals with fixed time delay, determined by the position of the disturbance and extracted by signal correlation method, are obtained. Then the position of disturbance can be calculated by it. Experiments show that low-frequency noise has a great impact on the positioning results, and even leads to the failure of positioning. In this work, the influence of disturbance frequency and sampling rate on the accuracy of calculation results is analyzed, and two new processing methods is proposed. Firstly, we use bandpass filtering to eliminate the effects of these factors. Disturbances at different locations require different filtering ranges. We propose a method to determine the filter range by null-frequency, which can achieve higher positioning accuracy. Secondly, the sampling rate of 0.5 MHz is raised to 2.5 MHz by using spline interpolation method. The combination of these two methods can achieve higher accuracy and better reliability of positioning results. Experiments results show that the positioning accuracy of this method can be improved from 200 m to 40 m with the total length of SF is 40 km.",60009860,Fudan University,Shanghai,China,['1706'],21.916666666666668,0.14401913875598085,0.4796251993620414,0

In this meta-analysis paper, we reframe discussions from usability to the design of cognitive load in terms of learnability, goals-problem-solving and three types of cognition amidst intrinsic and extraneous load. We premise that cognitive-affective-social engagement arises from goal-based intentions, involving meaningful learning either directly or indirectly. Thus, first, design for germane load, then address intrinsic and extraneous loads. We premise that germane load/generative processing/learning can lead to excitatory neural circuits, crucial to the stimulation/maintenance of brain plasticity/develop a certain degree of compensatory networks. Second, we premise that prompting goal-based intentions, developing better problem-solving skills and distributing cognition may be more effective in reducing the scope of information processing, thus reducing extraneous cognitive load and releasing capacity for generative processing. Findings highlight that for interaction design, four factors, i.e., authentic relevance, playfulness, challenge and ""rewards"" contribute to meaningfulness/worthwhile goals.

837,837,Do phantom questions measure social desirability?," One way of handling the problem is to measure social desirability and to incorporate it into the statistical analysis. There are different techniques of measuring social desirability. We investigate and compare the performance of the well-known Crowne-Marlowe scale with the less common use of phantom questions. Up to now, there is only one study, which tests the comparative performance of both instruments (Randall & Fernandes 1991). In this paper we replicate the test and introduce a few innovations. In difference to the former study, we compare two short versions of the Crowne-Marlowe scale, the 10-items version as suggested by Clancy and Gove (1974) and a 10-items version suggested by Stocké (2014). First, we test both scales with respect to their internal consistency. Second, we investigate which of the two versions has the strongest impact on different sensitive behaviors (alcohol consumption, shoplifting, law compliance, and reported life satisfaction). Third, we construct 20 phantom questions, 10 with fictitious answering categories that can hardly be confused with existing things, and 10 where the fictitious categories resemble existing persons or sites. We then investigate whether the phantom questions pick up social desirability better than the Crowne-Marlowe scale. The study was conducted online with 365 student subjects. Our results indicate that the short version of the Crowne-Marlowe scale suggested by Clancy and Gove (1974) performs best. But none of our phantom questions or any combination of them is able to pick up social desirability.

The required light sources for these detectors are high power (200 W) with low intensity and frequency noise [1]. These requirements are currently met with the amplification of a monolithic single-frequency Nd:YAG non-planar-ringoscillator (NPRO) [2]. To improve the sensitivity of next generation detectors, cryogenic silicon test masses have been proposed to reduce the thermal coating noise. Laser sources near 2000 nm appear promising as they lie in the silicon transmission window and have reduced absorption in the amorphous silica coatings which reduces the heat-load on the cryogenically cooled mirrors [3]. High power thulium-doped fibre amplifiers provide broad emission in this wavelength range and have previously been demonstrated with high power and narrow linewidths [4].

A game-based evaluation study, using Kinaesthetic Learning Difficulties Diagnosis (Kin-LDD), was performed during the actual diagnosis procedure for the identification of learning difficulties. Kin-LDD is a serious game that provides a gesture-based interface and incorporates spatial and time orientation activities. These activities assess children’s cognitive attributes while they are using their motor skills to interact with the game. The aim of this work was to introduce the fun parameter to the diagnostic process, provide a useful tool for the special educators and investigate potential correlations between in-game metrics and the diagnosis outcome. An experiment was conducted in which 30 children played the game during their official assessment for the diagnosis of learning difficulties at the Center for Differential Diagnosis, Diagnosis and Support. Performance metrics were collected automatically while the children were playing the game. These metrics, along with questionnaires appropriate for children and post-session interviews were later analyzed and the findings are presented in the paper. According to the results: (a) children evaluated the game as a fun experience, (b) special educators claimed it was helpful to the diagnostic procedure, and (c) there were statistically significant correlations between in-game metrics and the category of learning difficulty the child was characterized with.",60067711,Hellenic Open University,Patra,Greece,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",24.333333333333332,-0.038558201058201055,0.432473544973545,0

844,844,Education and attachment: Guidelines to prevent school failure," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Portuguese schools have high student failure and early school leaving rates (Pordata, 2017) giving rise to a number of initiatives aimed at their reduction. The “Alternative Curricular Course” (ACC) promotes the learning of basic skills, specifically in Portuguese language and Mathematics, to support logical reasoning and artistic, vocational, and professional development. Its main goal is the fulfilment of compulsory schooling and the reduction of academic failure. Research based on attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969) suggests that different internal working models of attachment are associated with different characteristics of social, academic, emotional, and behavioural competencies that may interfere in the quality of relationships that young people establish in school, especially with teachers, and also influence their academic performance. This study evaluates the relationship between internal working models of students, their perceptions of the quality of their relationships with teachers, and their academic performance using three measures: (i) the “Inventory of Attachment in Childhood and Adolescence” (IACA) measure, (ii) the “Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment” (IPPA) measure—concerning the attachment to teacher”, and (iii) a socio-demographic questionnaire on a sample of 305 students from the 8th grade of regular education (RE) and the ACC. The results reveal that students on the ACC exhibit a less secure internal working model than students in RE, and that the perception of the quality of the student-teacher relationship, regarding the dimension of acceptance and understanding by the teachers, is associated with a better academic performance. These results align with those of other recent studies in support of the conclusion that the process of attachment has a significant influence on educational contexts, consistent with attachment and related theories.",60016979,Universidade da Madeira,Funchal,Portugal,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",39.142857142857146,0.046952380952380954,0.33167399267399267,0

GMs are defined by input and output space information transformations using context-based fuzzy C-means clustering. The input space information transformation is directly induced by the output space context. Usually, the output space context is evenly divided. In this paper, the linguistic context was flexibly divided by stochastically distributing data in the output space. Unlike most fuzzy models, this GM yielded information segmentation. Their performance is usually evaluated using the root mean square error, which utilizes the difference between the model's output and ground truth. However, this is inadequate for the performance evaluation of information innovation-based GMs. Thus, the GM performance was compared and analyzed using the linguistic context partitioning by selecting the appropriate performance evaluation method for the GM. The method was augmented by the coverage and specificity of the GMs output as the performance index. For the GM validation, its performance was compared and analyzed using the auto MPG dataset.

Various static and dynamic analysis methods are being introduced to detect and defend against these attacks. The malware that is detected by these methods includes advanced present threat (APT) attacks, which allow additional intervention by attackers. Such malware presents a variety of threats (DNS, C&C, Malicious IP, etc.) This threat information used to defend against variants of malicious attacks. However, the intelligence that is detected in this manner is used in the blocking policies of information-security systems. Consequently, it is difficult for staff who perform Computer Emergence Response Team security control to determine the extent to which cyberattacks such as malware are a potential threat. Additionally, it is difficult to use this intelligence to establish long-term defense strategies for specific APT attacks or implement intelligent internal security systems. Therefore, a decision-making model that identifies threat sources and malicious activities (MAs) that occur during the static and dynamic analysis of various types of collected malware and performs machine learning based on a quantitative analysis of these threat sources and activities is proposed herein.

855,855,Feature selection for blood glucose level prediction in type 1 diabetes mellitus by using the sequential input selection algorithm (SISAL),"Feature selection is a primary exercise to tackle any forecasting task. Machine learning algorithms used to predict any variable can improve their performance by lessening their computational effort with a proper dataset. Anticipating future glycemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) patients provides a baseline in its management, and in this task, we need to carefully select data, especially now, when novel wearable devices offer more and more information. In this paper, a complete characterization of 25 diabetic people has been carried out, registering innovative variables like sleep, schedule, or heart rate in addition to other well-known ones like insulin, meal, and exercise. With this ground-breaking data compilation, we present a study of these features using the Sequential Input Selection Algorithm (SISAL), which is specially prepared for time series data.

856,856,Low-complexity partial transmit sequence methods using dominant time-domain samples for multicarrier faster-than-Nyquist signaling," All rights reserved.In Multicarrier faster-than-Nyquist (MFTN) systems, one of the most important problems of MFTN signaling is high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, partial transmit sequence (PTS) method is adopted to resolve this problem, and we focus on reducing the computational complexity of it. First, the PTS method combined with alternative signal (AS) is introduced to overcome the overlapping structure of MFTN signaling. Then, due to the dominant time-domain samples of MFTN signaling are used, a new metric which can select dominant time-domain samples accurately is proposed. Based on that, two low-complexity PTS methods are proposed. To further reduce the computational complexity, by analyzing the position distribution of sample with peak power, part of the samples are removed from the procedure of calculating metric for selecting dominant time-domain samples. Simulation results confirm that the proposed low-complexity PTS methods can effectively reduce computational complexity without degrading the PAPR reduction performance.",60069734,Logistical Engineering University China,Chongqing,China,['1700'],21.714285714285715,0.22213636363636363,0.5436212121212122,0

859,859,"Chemometric evaluation of the link between acute toxicity, health issues and physicochemical properties of silver nanoparticles","The present study's objective is to focus on some developments in the field of statistical models of a complex system, like nanoparticles responses in the environmental media. An important problem that still needs to be studied and interpreted is the relations between physicochemical parameters of the nanoparticles like primary size, primary hydrophobic diameter, zeta potential, etc. with respective toxicity values. It holds true especially for silver nanoparticle systems due to their known bactericidal effect and wide distribution in practice. The present study deals with the data for physicochemical and toxicity parameters of 94 different silver nanoparticle systems in order to reveal specific relations between physicochemical properties and acute toxicity readings using multivariate statistical methods. Searching for these specific relationships between physicochemical parameters and toxicity responses is the novel element in the present study. This has focused our study toward developing a model that describes the relationship between physicochemical properties and toxicity of silver NPs based on a dataset gathered from the literature. It is shown that the systems studied could be divided into four patterns (clusters) of similarity depending not only on the physicochemical indicators related to particles size but also by their acute toxicity.

861,861,A closed-form localization algorithm and GDOP analysis for multiple TDOAs and single TOA based hybrid positioning,"Cellular communication systems support mobile phones positioning function for Enhanced-911 (E-911) location requirements, but the positioning accuracy is poor. The fifth-generation (5G) cellular communication system can use indoor distribution systems to provide accurate multiple time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and single time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements, which could significantly improve the indoor positioning ability. Unlike iterative localization algorithms for TDOA or TOA, the existing closed-form algorithms, such as the Chan-Ho algorithm, do not have convergence problems, but can only estimate position based on one kind of measurement. This paper proposes a closed-form localization algorithm for multiple TDOAs and single TOA measurements. The proposed algorithm estimates the final position result using three-step weighted least squares (WLSs). The first WLS provides an initial position for the last two steps. Then the algorithm uses two WLSs to estimate position based on heteroscedastic TDOA and TOA measurements. In addition, the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) of the proposed hybrid TDOA and TOA positioning has been derived. The analysis of GDOP shows that the proposed hybrid positioning has lower GDOP than TDOA-only positioning, which means the proposed hybrid positioning has a higher accuracy limitation than TDOA-only positioning. The simulation shows that the proposed localization algorithm could have better performance than closed-form TDOA-only positioning methods, and the positioning accuracy could approximate Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) when the TDOA measurement errors are small.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,['1706'],22.1,0.04642857142857143,0.4598370927318296,1
862,862,A review of pneumatic actuators used for the design of medical simulators and medical tools," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Simulators have been traditionally used for centuries during medical gestures training. Nowadays, mechatronic technologies have opened the way to more evolved solutions enabling objective assessment and dedicated pedagogic scenarios. Trainees can now practice in virtual environments representing various kind of patient and body parts including physio-pathologies issues. Gestures, to be mastered, vary according to each medical specialty (e.g., ultrasound probe orientations, or forceps installation during assisted delivery). Hence, medical students need kinesthetic feedback in order to significantly improve their learning capabilities. Gesture simulators require haptic devices with variable stiffness actuators. Existing solutions do not always fit the requirements because of their significant size. Contrary to electric actuators, pneumatic technology is low-cost, available off-the-shelf and offers a better mass–power ratio. However, it presents two main drawbacks: nonlinear dynamics and need for a compressed air supply. During the last decade, we have developed several haptic solutions based on pneumatic actuation (e.g., birth simulator, epidural needle insertion simulator) and, recently, in a joint venture with Prisme laboratory, a pneumatic probe master device for remote ultrasonography. This paper recalls literature scientific approaches on pneumatic actuation developed in the medical context and illustrated with the aforementioned applications to highlight the benefits.",60029689,Universite d'Orleans,Orleans,France,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",18.181818181818183,0.15289855072463768,0.31521739130434784,0
863,863,Cartographic visualization for indoor semantic wayfinding," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In recent years, pedestrian navigation assistance has been used by an increasing number of people to support wayfinding tasks. Especially in unfamiliar and complex indoor environments such as universities and hospitals, the importance of an effective navigation assistance becomes apparent. This paper investigates the feasibility of the indoor landmark navigation model (ILNM), a method for generating landmark-based routing instructions, by combining it with indoor route maps and conducting a wayfinding experiment with human participants. Within this context, three different cartographic visualization scenarios were designed and evaluated. Two of these scenarios were based on the implementation of the ILNM algorithm, with the concurrent effort to overcome the challenge of representing the semantic navigation instructions in two different ways. In the first scenario, the selected landmarks were visualized as pictograms, while in the second scenario, an axonometric-based design philosophy for the depiction of landmarks was followed. The third scenario was based on the benchmark approach (metric-based routing instructions) for conveying routing instructions to the users. The experiment showed that the implementation of the ILNM was feasible, and, more importantly, it was beneficial in terms of participants’ navigation performance during the wayfinding experiment, compared to the metric-based instructions scenario (benchmark for indoor navigation). Valuable results were also obtained, concerning the most suitable cartographic approach for visualizing the selected landmarks, while implementing this specific algorithm (ILNM). Finally, our findings confirm that the existence of landmarks, not only within the routing instructions, but also as cartographic representations on the route map itself, can significantly help users to position themselves correctly within an unfamiliar environment and to improve their navigation performance.",60025858,ETH Zürich,"Zurich ZH,",Switzerland,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",26.9,0.14625,0.5341666666666667,0

For these visualizations to achieve their aim, they must not only target people’s energy saving objectives but also support the necessary factors that help people to change their underlying energy consumption behavior. In this paper, we survey several categories of existing interactive energy visualizations and through a number of selected examples in each case, identify possible potentials for supporting any user behavior changes. For this survey, we have used the behavior change model originally proposed by B. J. Fogg, which defines three factors of motivation, trigger and ability. Our survey has shown that most existing interactive visualizations target the motivation factor, with some supporting trigger or ability and only a few dealing with all the three factors of the behavior change model.",60103653,Aalto University,Espoo,Finland,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",24.0,0.12884615384615386,0.5423076923076923,0

Bursts may also be a signal of topics that are of growing real-world interest. Since bursts can be caused by exogenous phenomena and are indicative of burgeoning popularity, leveraging cross platform social media data may be valuable for predicting bursts within a single social media platform. A Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model is proposed in order to capture the temporal dependencies and associations based upon activity information. The data used to test the model was collected from Twitter, Github, and Reddit. Our results show that the LSTM based model is able to leverage the complex cross-platform dynamics to predict bursts.

867,867,Envisioning intention-oriented brain-to-speech decoding,"The typical approach to decoding speech from the brain (using brain–machine interfaces) is to decode low-level linguistic units (e.g. phonemes, syllables) from motor articulation areas (e.g. premotor cortex) with the aim of assembling these low-level units into higher-level discourse. We propose that brain-to-speech decoding may benefit from adopting a functional view of language, which conceives of language as an instrumental tool for interacting with others’ intentions in order to fulfil one’s own intentions. This functional view of language motivates adopting usability (i.e. the decoder’s usefulness as a tool for achieving goals), in addition to decoding accuracy, as a criterion for assessing decoder performance. Decoders may achieve gains in usability by incorporating data about communicative situations and speaker intentions in order to generate and fill in speech act templates. We suggest that this intention-oriented, template-based, and functionally inspired view of brain-to-speech decoding may facilitate efforts to achieve naturalistic speech decoding.",60012957,University of Maryland School of Medicine,Baltimore,United States,['1702'],18.625,0.23333333333333334,0.55,1

Most of the existing research essentially considers the outline of linear protocols, using complex mathematical equations in various orders. In this work, however, we designed and developed an alternative nonlinear protocol based on simple and effective mathematical approaches. The designed protocol in this sense was modified from the Doubly Stochastic Quadratic Operators (DSQO) and was aimed at resolving consensus problems. Therefore, we called it Modified Doubly Stochastic Quadratic Operators (MDSQO). The protocol was derived in the context of coordinated systems to overcome the consensus issue related to multi-agent systems. In the process, we proved that by using the proposed nonlinear protocol, the consensus could be reached via a common agreement among the agents (average consensus) in a fast and easy fashion without losing any initial status. Moreover, the investigated nonlinear protocol of MDSQO realized the reaching consensus always as well as DSQO in some cases, which could not reach consensus.

869,869,Can skeuomorphic design provide a better online banking user experience for older adults?," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.With the prevalence of digital technologies and internet connectivity, combined with the reduction in footfall on high streets, banks have taken steps to move most of their customer base online. This has left many older adults behind, trying to keep up with the changes and having to learn to use sometimes complex online banking interfaces. In this work we investigate whether skeuomorphic design can create a more usable online banking system for older adults, compared to the more commonplace flat design. This work took a user-centered approach, beginning with interviews with older adults that were conducted to gather data to be used in the production of prototype user interfaces. Two prototypes were then created: a flat user interface and a skeuomorphic one. We evaluated these interfaces with 15 older adults, gathering a combination of data, including data from the System Usability Scale, observations, and interviews. Results of the experiments showed that our older users preferred the flat prototype to the skeuomorphic one, but raised some potentially useful guidelines for the design of future skeuomorphic user interfaces for older adults. A validation experiment with 17 younger adults (aged 20–25) also showed that the skeuomorphic interface was more usable for older adults than younger ones.",60032204,Sheffield Hallam University,Sheffield,United Kingdom,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",25.875,0.0942948717948718,0.32205128205128203,0

The development of the intellectual property law has been focused primarily on strengthening the protection of these rights. However, such enhanced protection leads to restrictions on the use of intellectual property. Therefore, it is necessary to find a proper balance. Problem Statement. The issues of legal protection of copyright and related rights shall be considered by the national legislator taking into account the international regulations. At present, the world has created a ramified system of internatio¬nal acts in this area, including, in certain conflicting aspects that require comprehensive consideration and, at the same time, created opportunities for maneuvering between the different norms embodied in different acts. Therefore, certain aspects of the legal regulation of copyright and related rights under 9 key international acts (Berne Convention, Universal Copyright Convention, Treaty on the International Registration of Audiovisual Works, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) - Treaty on Copyright Law and Performances and Phonograms, Rome Convention, Geneva Convention, Brussels Convention on the Distribution of Signals Carrying Programs Transmitted via Satellites, TRIPS Agreement) have been compared with each other and with the Ukrainian legislation in terms of optimization of legal regulation. Purpose. To generalize international legal regulation of copyright and related rights and to compare it with the Uk¬rainian legal regulation. Materials and Methods. The methods of documentary analysis and synthesis, comparative analysis, objective truth, etc. have been used. Results. The legislation of Ukraine absolutizes the protection of copyright and related rights. In the context of the international discourse on the liberalization of restrictions on the use of intellectual property, the Ukrainian legal regulation does not fully comply with the modern international trends. Conclusions. The absolutization of the protection of copyright and related rights does not automatically makes such protection consistent with the international standards. Recently, the world has developed an understanding of the need to harmonize the interests of authors (performers) with the interests of the society for access to the objects of these rights.",60008300,National Aviation University,Kiev,Ukraine,['1706'],17.263157894736842,0.08698979591836735,0.2962585034013605,1

In this analysis, a recent numeric-analytic technique, called the fractional residual power series (FRPS) approach, was successfully employed in obtaining eective approximate solutions to the Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation of the fractional sense. The proposed algorithm relies on a generalized classical power series under the Caputo sense and the concept of an error function that systematically produces an analytical solution in a convergent fractional power series form with accurately computable structures, without the need for any unphysical restrictive assumptions. Meanwhile, two illustrative applications are included to show the eciency, reliability, and performance of the proposed technique.

People who choose a smartphone for Internet-related tasks are different from people who mainly use a PC or tablet. Smartphone use is particularly high among the young and urban. We have to make web surveys attractive for smartphone completion in order not to lose these groups of smartphone users. In this paper we study how to encourage people to complete surveys on smartphones in order to attract hard-to-reach subgroups of the population. We experimentally test new features of a survey-friendly design: we test two versions of an invitation letter to a survey, a new questionnaire lay-out, and autoforwarding. The goal of the experiment is to evaluate whether the new survey design attracts more smartphone users, leads to a better survey experience on smartphones and results in more respondents signing up to become a member of a probability-based online panel. Our results show that the invitation letter that emphasizes the possibility for smartphone completion does not yield a higher response rate than the control condition, nor do we find differences in the socio-demographic background of respondents. We do find that slightly more respondents choose a smartphone for survey completion. The changes in the layout of the questionnaire do lead to a change in survey experience on the smartphone. Smartphone respondents need 20% less time to complete the survey when the questionnaire includes autoforwarding. However, we do not find that respondents evaluate the survey better, nor are they more likely to become a member of the panel when asked at the end of the survey.

Optical measurements were performed to determine the shift of the Bragg wavelength as a function of accumulated dose and relaxation time. To simulate real time conditions of a radiation dosimeter, the FBGs are examined through three consecutive radiation stages followed by very limited recovery times. We were able to obtain a Bragg wavelength shift with both sets of FBGs. The PCF-FBGs response included strong recovery after each irradiation compared to the STD-FBGs.

884,884,Unsupervised keyphrase extraction for web pages," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Keyphrase extraction is an important part of natural language processing (NLP) research, although little research is done in the domain of web pages. The World Wide Web contains billions of pages that are potentially interesting for various NLP tasks, yet it remains largely untouched in scientific research. Current research is often only applied to clean corpora such as abstracts and articles from academic journals or sets of scraped texts from a single domain. However, textual data from web pages differ from normal text documents, as it is structured using HTML elements and often consists of many small fragments. These elements are furthermore used in a highly inconsistent manner and are likely to contain noise. We evaluated the keyphrases extracted by several state-of-the-art extraction methods and found that they did not transfer well to web pages. We therefore propose WebEmbedRank, an adaptation of a recently proposed extraction method that can make use of structural information in web pages in a robust manner. We compared this novel method to other baselines and state-of-the-art methods using a manually annotated dataset and found that WebEmbedRank achieved significant improvements over existing extraction methods on web pages.",60010023,University of Groningen,Groningen,Netherlands,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",24.375,0.09236471861471861,0.5060389610389611,0

Detection of hydrogen gas, a renewable and clean source of energy, in the atmosphere is of great importance in maintaining safety at all stages of hydrogen production, storage and use. In this work, a novel conductometric sensor has been developed based on hybrid 2D nanostructured rGO doped with Pd nanoparticles (Pd/rGO) to evaluate its sensing performance towards hydrogen with different concentrations (up to 1%). Various sensing parameters including sensitivity, response/recovery time, stability, and low detection limit have been investigated throughout the experiment. We also evaluate performance of the developed sensors at different operating temperatures (room temperature up to 120°C). Material properties of hybrid Pd/rGO film including surface morphologies, crystallinity, molecular vibration, functional groups, and oxidation states are sufficiently analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), profilometer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy.

886,886,Actively tunable metalens array based on patterned phase change materials,"Recently, the metalens has been investigated for its application in many fields due to its advantages of being much smaller than a conventional lens and is compatible with nano-devices. Although metalenses have extraordinary optical performance, it is still not enough in some occasions such as wavefront detection for adaptive optics and display for large area applications. Using a metalens array is an ideal solution to solve these problems. Unfortunately, the common metalens array cannot be adjusted once it is fabricated, which limits its range of application. In this article, we designed an actively tunable metalens array for the first time by arranging the patterned phase change material Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) appropriately. For the metalens array designed at the wavelength of 4.6 μm, it had excellent broadband performance in the range from 4.5 μm to 5.2 μm. On the other hand, by tuning the phase state of GST, the focus and display of the metalens array can be controlled, acting as switching on or off. Furthermore, any graphics constructed with patterned focal spots can be achieved when the metalens array has sufficient secondary unit cells.

In order to promote the incorporation of perovskite into integrated devices, microscale color patterning flexibility is a very important step. Femtosecond (fs) laser fabrication has shown significant advantages of high spatial resolution, low surround damage, and high processing efficiency over the other laser fabrication. Compared to the state-of-art techniques, the straightforward fs-direct laser writing (fs-DLW) also has advantages of mask-free, simple one step, and contactless. Here, a specially designed formamidinium lead mixed-halide nanoplatelet (FAPb(BrxI1-x)3 NP) with gradient bandgap is fabricated by chemical vapor deposition method. Then, spatially resolved modulation of the fluorescence by fs-DLW is demonstrated on the as-grown NP. The fluorescence color is modulated from red to green under a controlled laser pulse, due to the replacement of iodide ions by bromide ions. Specifically, the as-grown NP (thickness800 nm) is with a gradual bromide-iodide composition along the depth, mainly exhibits an emission of 710-nm from the bottom iodine rich phase. After halide substitution induced by fs-DLW, new fluorescence peaks appear in the wavelength range of 540 to 700 nm, which is controlled by the fs-DLW conditions. The fluorescent color is spatially modulated from red to green, enabling microscale resolved multicolor emission, implying the potential applications in micro-encryption, sensors, multicolor displays, lasers, and light-emitting devices.",60030804,Swinburne University of Technology,Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],22.4,0.10341696182605271,0.5134750098386462,1

892,892,Target image mask correction based on skeleton divergence,"Traditional approaches to modeling and processing discrete pixels are mainly based on image features or model optimization. These methods often result in excessive shrinkage or expansion of the restored pixel region, inhibiting accurate recovery of the target pixel region shape. This paper proposes a simultaneous source and mask-images optimization model based on skeleton divergence that overcomes these problems. In the proposed model, first, the edge of the entire discrete pixel region is extracted through bilateral filtering. Then, edge information and Delaunay triangulation are used to optimize the entire discrete pixel region. The skeleton is optimized with the skeleton as the local optimization center and the source and mask images are simultaneously optimized through edge guidance. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and point-cloud regularization verification are subsequently employed to provide the optimal merging strategy and reduce cumulative error. In the regularization verification stage, the model is iteratively simplified via incremental and hierarchical clustering, so that point-cloud sampling is concentrated in the high-curvature region. The results of experiments conducted using the moving-target region in the RGB-depth (RGB-D) data (Technical University of Munich, Germany) indicate that the proposed algorithm is more accurate and suitable for image processing than existing high-performance algorithms.",60103821,Zhejiang Sci-Tech University,Hangzhou,China,['1703'],22.77777777777778,0.18777777777777777,0.4955555555555555,1

An experimental verification of the shued complex evolution metropolis algorithm (SCEM-UA) for identifying the optimal parameters of structural systems and estimating their uncertainty is presented. First, the estimation framework is theoretically developed. The SCEM-UA algorithm is employed to search through feasible parameters' space and to infer the posterior distribution of the parameters automatically. The resulting posterior parameter distribution then provides the most likely estimation of parameter sets that produces the best model performance. The algorithm is subsequently validated through both numerical simulation and shaking table experiment for estimating the parameters of structural systems considering the uncertainty of available information. Finally, the proposed algorithm is extended to identify the uncertain physical parameters of a nonlinear structural system with a particle mass tuned damper (PTMD). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can eectively estimate parameters with uncertainty for nonlinear structural systems, and it has a stronger anti-noise capability.

909,909,"Perception System Design for Low-Cost Commercial Ground Robots: Sensor Configurations, Calibration, Localization and Mapping","For commercially successful ground robots, high degree of autonomy, low manufacturing and maintenance cost, as well as minimized deployment limitations in different environments are essential attributes. To deliver an 'anywhere deployable' product, it is impractical to rely on one single sensor or one single piece of algorithm to overcome all related challenges. Instead, the entire robotic system should be dedicated designed, including the choices of sensors, processors, algorithm integration for various functionality, and so on.This paper presents our design of perception system for commercial ground robots, which is able to operate in most common environments. The designed system is equipped with low-cost sensors and processors. The first key contribution of this paper is the design of the robotic sensory system, which includes a monocular camera, a 2D laser range finder (LRF), wheel encoders, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our sensory system can be built at a cost of as low as 100. Furthermore, the selected sensors provide complementary characteristics for perception of both robot ego-motion and its surrounding environments, which are the prerequisites for 'anywhere' deployment. The second key contribution of this paper is that a complete set of technologies is proposed based on our sensor systems, including sensor calibration (factory calibration and online calibration), localization (environmental exploring and re-localization), as well as mapping.

910,910,Nonparametric tensor completion based on gradient descent and nonconvex penalty,"Existing tensor completion methods all require some hyperparameters. However, these hyperparameters determine the performance of each method, and it is diffcult to tune them. In this paper, we propose a novel nonparametric tensor completion method, which formulates tensor completion as an unconstrained optimization problem and designs an effcient iterative method to solve it. In each iteration, we not only calculate the missing entries by the aid of data correlation, but consider the low-rank of tensor and the convergence speed of iteration. Our iteration is based on the gradient descent method, and approximates the gradient descent direction with tensor matricization and singular value decomposition. Considering the symmetry of every dimension of a tensor, the optimal unfolding direction in each iteration may be different. So we select the optimal unfolding direction by scaled latent nuclear norm in each iteration. Moreover, we design formula for the iteration step-size based on the nonconvex penalty. During the iterative process, we store the tensor in sparsity and adopt the power method to compute the maximum singular value quickly. The experiments of image inpainting and link prediction show that our method is competitive with six state-of-the-art methods.",60017179,Shantou University,Shantou,China,['1701'],19.0,0.033333333333333326,0.5375,1
912,912,Submicron simultaneous ir and raman microscopy (ir+raman): Breakthrough developments in optical photothermal ir (o-ptir) combined with raman provide new capabilities," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.We introduce a new approach to infrared microspectroscopy-Optical-Photothermal Infrared (O-PTIR) Spectroscopy. Based on the principles of the photothermal effect (in response to IR radiation), we describe and illustrate how the novel use of an optical probe (532nm laser) enables significant enhancements in IR micro-spectroscopy, with ∼20x improvement in spatial resolution compared to traditional IR microscopes (FTIR or direct QCL). Furthermore, this configuration enables the generally preferred and practical reflection (far-field) mode analysis without exhibiting any scatter artefacts and poor SNR of traditional systems, with O-PTIR reflection spectra being equivalent to FTIR transmission spectra. Due to the unique systems architecture, namely, the use of a visible probe beam to extract IR spectroscopic information, we show how this same visible laser can be used simultaneously as a Raman excitation source, thus delivering IR and Raman microspectroscopy from the same spot at the same time with the same spatial resolution. As a performance proof, IR spatial resolution of 400nm across a polymer interface has been obtained, together with 900nm single polymeric particle detection from a microplastics model system from a dried saline solution. Reflection mode fiber analysis of 10 micron and 800nm fibers shows reflection spectra are unaffected by fiber diameter to produce high quality FTIR-Transmission mode comparable data. Finally, we demonstrate live cell (epithelial cheek cells) IR spectroscopic imaging analysis in water with submicron intracellular resolution.",121346304,PHOTOTHERMAL SPECTROSCOPY CORP.,Santa Barbara,United States,['1706'],33.42857142857143,0.024314935064935067,0.4729415584415584,0
913,913,Creating big time crystals with ultracold atoms," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.We report progress towards realizing discrete time crystals using a BEC of potassium-39 atoms bouncing on an oscillating mirror. In the absence of interactions, each bouncing atom performs classical motion in which there are resonant islands in phase space located around periodic orbits whose periods match an integral multiple s of the driving period T of the mirror. If all the atoms are prepared in a single wave-packet, in the absence of interactions they tunnel to neighbouring wave-packets on a timescale determined by the driving amplitude and period of the oscillating mirror. In the presence of a sufficiently strong attractive interaction, the Floquet eigenstates of the periodic system become Schrödinger cat-like states, so that measurement of the position of just a single atom is sufficient to break the timetranslation symmetry and cause the system to collapse into one of the s wave-packets bouncing with period sT. Such a system allows dramatic breaking of discrete time translation symmetry where the symmetry-broken state evolves with a period typically s=40 times longer than the driving period and does not decay. This system provides also a suitable platform for demonstrating a wide range of condensed matter phenomena in the time domain.",60030804,Swinburne University of Technology,Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],34.5,0.06539115646258503,0.37227891156462584,0

917,917,Graph theory approach to the vulnerability of transportation networks,"Nowadays, transport is the basis for the functioning of national, continental, and global economies. Thus, many governments recognize it as a critical element in ensuring the daily existence of societies in their countries. Those responsible for the proper operation of the transport sector must have the right tools to model, analyze, and optimize its elements. One of the most critical problems is the need to prevent bottlenecks in transport networks. Thus, the main aim of the article was to define the parameters characterizing the transportation network vulnerability and select algorithms to support their search. The parameters proposed are based on characteristics related to domination in graph theory. The domination, edge-domination concepts, and related topics, such as bondage-connected and weighted bondage-connected numbers, were applied as the tools for searching and identifying the bottlenecks in transportation networks. Furthermore, the algorithms for finding the minimal dominating set and minimal (maximal) weighted dominating sets are proposed. This way, the exemplary academic transportation network was analyzed in two cases: stationary and dynamic. Some conclusions are presented. The main one is the fact that the methods given in this article are universal and applicable to both small and large-scale networks.

918,918,A novel neural network-based method for medical text classification,"Medical text categorization is a specific area of text categorization. Classification for medical texts is considered a special case of text classification. Medical text includes medical records and medical literature, both of which are important clinical information resources. However, medical text contains complex medical vocabularies, medical measures, which has problems with high-dimensionality and data sparsity, so text classification in the medical domain is more challenging than those in other general domains. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a unified neural network method. In the sentence representation, the convolutional layer extracts features from the sentence and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BIGRU) is used to access both the preceding and succeeding sentence features. An attention mechanism is employed to obtain the sentence representation with the important word weights. In the document representation, the method uses the BIGRU to encode the sentences, which is obtained in sentence representation and then decode it through the attention mechanism to get the document representation with important sentence weights. Finally, a category of medical text is obtained through a classifier. Experimental verifications are conducted on four medical text datasets, including two medical record datasets and two medical literature datasets. The results clearly show that our method is effective.",60023813,Shanghai University,Shanghai,China,['1705'],18.636363636363637,0.11044973544973545,0.3353615520282187,1

However, ECG signals are susceptible to be contaminated with various noises, which affect the application value of ECG signals. In this paper, we propose an ECG signal de-noising method using wavelet energy and a sub-band smoothing filter. Unlike the traditional wavelet threshold de-noising method, which carries out threshold processing for all wavelet coefficients, the wavelet coefficients that require threshold de-noising are selected according to the wavelet energy and other wavelet coefficients remain unchanged in the proposed method. Moreover, The sub-band smoothing filter is adopted to further de-noise the ECG signal and improve the ECG signal quality. The ECG signals of the standardMIT-BIH database are adopted to verify the proposed method usingMATLAB software. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed using Signal-To-Noise ratio (SNR), Mean Square Error (MSE) and percent root mean square difference (PRD). The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can effectively remove noise from the noisy ECG signals in comparison to the existing methods.",60001338,Changsha University of Science and Technology,Changsha,China,['1706'],21.625,-0.010000000000000009,0.5,0

Meanwhile, considering the large chattering phenomenon caused by high switching gains, a composite integral terminal sliding mode control method based on disturbance observer is proposed to reduce chattering phenomenon.

923,923,Visual search performance and strategy for three-dimensional visualization systems: Impact of radiologist experience,"The visual search performance of radiologists is systematically challenged due to the use of flat-panel displays when viewing multi-slice images. Three-dimensional visualization of information is expected to facilitate visual search for radiologists. However, as the differences in user performance, depending on radiologist experience, have not yet been assessed for real three-dimensional images, it is difficult to estimate the usability of new visualization systems for radiologists with different amounts of professional search experience. In this study, we aimed to determine how three-dimensional visual search is affected by radiologist experience and the physical properties of stimuli. Radiologists, residents, and medical students accomplished visual search tasks with varying set sizes and target-distractor similarities. Search items were presented on multiple display planes and image manipulation was conducted using a computer keyboard. We compared the search outcome and strategy among three groups of participants. All three groups submitted a similar number of correct responses depending on target-distractor similarity. However, in contrast to radiologists and residents, it took a considerably longer time for students to find the targets. The major differences were evident in search strategy when comparing the image manipulations of radiologists with those of residents and students. Our results demonstrated that experienced radiologists' search performance benefited from seeing the entire three-dimensional view of an image, whereas residents and students focused instead on reducing the amount of information and searched in a selective manner. These findings should be taken into account when planning the implementation of new workstations with three-dimensional visualization in radiology.",60071043,University of Latvia,Riga,Latvia,['1706'],20.666666666666668,0.05728305785123967,0.3387249114521842,1

926,926,Radiative processes of two accelerated entangled atoms near boundaries,"By considering the interaction between a two-atom system and the vacuum massless scalar field in the viewpoint of an instantaneously inertial observer, we study the rates of transition of a uniformly accelerated two-atom system in the symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state near a reflecting boundary and in a cavity, respectively. We find that both the downward transition |ψ± 〉→|gAgB〉 and the upward transition |ψ± 〉→|eAeB〉 occur for the accelerated two-atom system, as in sharp contrast with the case of a static two-atom system, in which the upward transition can never happen. Similar to the rates of transition of atoms immersed in a thermal bath with the FDU temperature, both the downward transition rate and the upward transition rate are characterized by the Plank factor (e2πω0/a-1)-1. This character of the transition rates is very different from the other radiative properties of the accelerated two-atom system, such as the resonance interatomic energy, for which the revisions of the effects of uniform acceleration are never characterized by such a factor. We show with analytical and numerical results that both the downward transition and the upward transition processes can be effectively manipulated by the atomic non-inertial motion and by the presence of boundaries. By comparing the upward transition rate with the downward transition rate, we discover that, when ω0 ≫ a with ω0 and a being the energy space and the proper acceleration of the two-atom system, the disentanglement caused by the upward transition is negligible, while, if ω0 ≪ a, the disentanglement caused by the upward transition becomes as important as that caused by the downward transition.",60031419,Ningbo University,Ningbo,China,['1701'],43.666666666666664,0.10320512820512821,0.5080769230769231,1

The detailed spectral and temporal behaviour arising from the processes causing the extreme spectral broadening remains of interest particularly where users require temporal stability for specific visible wavelengths generated by a supercontinuum source. The theoretical gravity-like potential model requires NIR Raman self-frequency shifted solitons in the anomalous dispersion region of the fibre to be phase matched with short wavelength dispersive waves travelling in the normal dispersion region of the fibre. This is difficult to probe in the fundamental EM mode of the host fibre as competing wavelength generating and spreading non-linear processes obscure results. Here, specific high order EM modes excited in the fibre generate a spectrally sparse supercontinuum which was investigated using polarization and spatio-spectral mapping to provide unequivocal phase matching evidence supporting the gravity-like trapping model. Further, polarization measurements reveal that the input polarization state is scrambled due to non-linear effects within the fibre during supercontinuum generation, having implications for interferometry using supercontinua.",60010571,"University of Newcastle, Australia",Callaghan,Australia,['1706'],29.166666666666668,0.03833333333333334,0.4999019607843138,0

To begin with, the whole network is divided into communities with different granularity by the Louvain algorithm. Secondly, the method of nodes importance analysis based on topological potential theory is extended from the network to the community structure, and the internal nodes of the community are classified into three types, namely important nodes, relatively important nodes, and fringe nodes. Furthermore, a compression algorithm for the community structure is designed to realize the compression of the network by retaining important nodes and merging fringe nodes. Finally, the compression network is laid out by the traditional force-directed layout method. Experimental results show that, compared with the compression layout methods of a complex network based on degree or PageRank, the method in this paper can retain the integrated community composition and its internal structure, which is convenient for users to effectively analyze the topology structure of a complex network.",122799884,Space Engineering University,Beijing,China,['1705'],32.714285714285715,0.06263736263736262,0.5524725274725275,1

In short, the measurement problem is the conflict between the evolution of the wavefunction described by Schrödinger's equation and the apparent collapse of the wavefunction after a measurement is done. The Wigner's friend paradox illustrates the conflict be-tween the two rules.

Wigner is a super-observer who is able to measure the laboratory his friend is in and also as-sign a quantum state.

937,937,Reducing redundant alarms in the pediatric ICU," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Physiologic monitors generate alarms to alert clinicians to signs of instability. However, these monitors also create alarm fatigue that places patients at risk. Redundant alarms have contributed to alarm fatigue without improving patient safety. In this study, our specific aim was to decrease the median percentage of redundant alarms by 50% within 6 months using the Model for Improvement. Our primary outcome was to lower the percentage of redundant alarms. We used the overall alarm rate per patient per day and code blue events as balancing metrics. We completed three Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles and generated run charts using standard industry criteria to determine the special cause. Ultimately, we decreased redundant alarms from a baseline of 6.4% of all alarms to 1.8%, surpassing our aim of a 50% reduction. Our overall alarm rate, one of our balancing metrics, decreased from 137 alarms/patient day to 118 alarms/patient day during the intervention period. No code blue events were determined to be related to incorrect setting of alarms. Decreasing redundant alarms is safe and feasible. Following a reduction in redundant alarms, more intensive alarm reduction methods are needed to continue to reduce alarm fatigue while keeping patients safe.",60030440,Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center,Cincinnati,United States,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",16.416666666666664,0.012244897959183673,0.28554421768707483,0
938,938,Grey wolf algorithm and multi-objective model for the manycast RSA problem in EONs,"Manycast routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) in elastic optical networks (EONs) has become a hot research field. In this paper, the mathematical model and high efficient algorithm to solve this challenging problem in EONs is investigated. First, a multi-objective optimization model, which minimizes network power consumption, the total occupied spectrum, and the maximum index of used frequency spectrum, is established. To handle this multi-objective optimization model, we integrate these three objectives into one by using a weighted sum strategy. To make the population distributed on the search domain uniformly, a uniform design method was developed. Based on this, an improved grey wolf optimization method (IGWO), which was inspired by PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization, PSO) and DE (Differential Evolution, DE), is proposed to solve the maximum model efficiently. To demonstrate high performance of the designed algorithm, a series of experiments are conducted using several different experimental scenes.

939,939,Optical fiber transmission quality analysis based on FPGA," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.With the development of high-speed digital system, high-speed serial data transmission is widely used and the FPGA containing high-speed serial transceiver is also widely used. The high-speed serial interface of Xilinx's FPGA includes GTP, GTX, GTH and other high-speed transceivers with different transmission rate. The physical transmission speed of these transceivers can reach tens of Gbps. These low-level high-speed transceivers can support a variety of top-level transmission protocols, such as SRIO, PCIE, SATA, optical fiber and so on. Among these top-level transmission protocols, optical fiber transmission has the longest transmission distance and is widely used in various scenarios. Optical fiber transmission has three advantages. Firstly, its transmission capacity is very large and it can support ultralong distance transmission, one line optical fiber transmission rate can easily reach several Gbps. Secondly, optical fiber communication has strong anti-electromagnetic interference characteristics, which can ensure the quality of data transmission. Thirdly, optical fiber transmission uses light wave for data transmission and the light wave transmitted in the optical fiber cannot run out, so there is no radiation and it is difficult to eavesdrop.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1706'],21.0,0.06351190476190476,0.42375000000000007,0
940,940,Object Proposal Algorithms in the Wild: Are they Generalizable to Robot Perception?,"The recent emergence of object proposal algorithms in the computer vision community shows great promise to addressing difficult problems in robotic such as object discovery and salient object detection. However, it is difficult to determine how these algorithms actually perform for real-world robot vision applications, because the standard evaluation protocol uses datasets which do not adequately account for real-world noise (motion blur, occlusion, etc.). We evaluated several state-of-the-art object proposal algorithms using naturalistic datasets from the robotics community, and found a substantial performance drop across all algorithms. This suggests that many object proposal algorithms are not as generalizable as the computer vision literature purports, which can have a significant impact on how they are applied to robotics. We also conducted a study on how each algorithm is influenced by specific kinds of real-world robot vision challenges, including variable brightness, gamma correction, Gaussian blur, and Gaussian noise. Our results provide insight into certain weaknesses of object proposal algorithms, which can be used to gauge how they might be suitable for different robotics applications.

943,943,Exploring travelers' characteristics affecting their intention to shift to bike-sharing systems due to a sophisticated mobile app," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Many cities have already installed bike-sharing systems for several years now, but especially in recent years with the rise of micro-mobility, many efforts are being made worldwide to improve the operation of these systems. Technology has an essential role to play in the success of micro-mobility schemes, including bike-sharing systems. In this paper, it is examined if a state-of-the-art mobile application (app) can contribute to increasing the usage levels of such a system. It is also seeking to identify groups of travelers, who are more likely to be affected by the sophisticated app. With this aim, a questionnaire survey was designed and addressed to the users of the bike-sharing system of the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, as well as to other residents of the city. Through a descriptive analysis, the most useful services that an app can provide are identified. Most importantly, two different types of predictive models (i.e., classification tree and binary logit model) were applied in order to identify groups of users who are more likely to shift to or to use the bike-sharing system due to the sophisticated app. The results of the two predictive models confirm that people of younger ages and those who are not currently users of the system are those most likely to be attracted to the system due to such an app. Other factors, such as car usage frequency, education, and income also appeared to have slight impact on travelers' intention to use the system more often due to the app.",113905829,Information Technologies Institute/Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH),Thessaloniki,Greece,['1703'],28.11111111111111,0.15694444444444444,0.4947222222222222,0

The CVE discussed is a reconstruction of the European Parliament in Brussels developed using the REVERIE (Real and Virtual Engagement In Realistic Immersive Environment) framework. REVERIE is a framework designed to support the creation of CVEs populated by ECAs capable of natural human-like behaviour, physical interaction and engagement. The ECA provides a tour of the virtual parliament and participates in the learning activity as an intervention mechanism to engage students. The ECA is capable of immediacy behaviour (verbal and non-verbal) and interactions to support a dialogic learning scenario. The design of the ECA is grounded on a theoretical framework that addresses the required characteristics of the ECA to successfully support collaborative learning. In this paper, we discuss the Heuristic Evaluation of the REVERIE ECA which revealed a wealth of usability problems that led to the development of a list of design recommendations to improve their usability, including its immediacy behaviours and interactions. An ECA capable of effectively creating rapport should result in more positive experiences for participants and better learning results for students in dialogic learning scenarios.

The aim of this study was to characterize the quality of the indoor air environment of the Co-Ops supermarkets in Kuwait based on investigation of CO2, CO, NO2, H2S, TVOCs, and NMHC. On-site measurements were conducted to evaluate these parameters in three locations at the selected Co-Ops, and the perceived air quality (PAQ) was determined to quantify the air's pollutants as perceived by humans. Moreover, the indoor air quality index (AQI) was constructed for the selected locations, and the ANOVA test was used to analyze the association between the observed concentrations among these environmental parameters. At least in one spot at each Co-Op, the tested environmental parameters exceeded the threshold limit set by the environmental agencies. The PAQ for Co-Op1,2, and 3 are 1.25,1.00, and 0.75 respectively.

At the same time, the energy eciency optimization problem of the system is structured, where optimization issues related to time allocation factors and power allocation are established. For the FD dual-antenna and the FD single-antenna energy harvesting system, energy eciency function is proven to be a concave function over the time-switch factor, and the optimal time-switching factor is theoretically obtained using the Lambert function. Then, according to the given value range of the optimal time switching factor, the optimal power distribution scheme is obtained by analyzing the derivative function of the system energy eciency and using the properties of the Lambert function. The time-switching factor and transmission power are optimally selected at the wireless power supply FD relay. Results reveal that the performance of energy eciency of the dual-antenna energy harvesting at the FD relay outperforms that of the single-antenna.

952,952,Robust CFAR detection for multiple targets in K-distributed sea clutter based on machine learning,"For K-distributed sea clutter, a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) is crucial as a desired property for automatic target detection in an unknown and non-stationary background. In multiple-target scenarios, the target masking effect reduces the detection performance of CFAR detectors evidently. A machine learning based processor, associating the artificial neural network (ANN) and a clustering algorithm of density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), namely, DBSCAN-CFAR, is proposed herein to address this issue. ANN is trained with a symmetrical structure to estimate the shape parameter of background clutter, whereas DBSCAN is devoted to excluding interference targets and sea spikes as outliers in the leading and lagging windows that are symmetrical about the cell under test (CUT). Simulation results verified that the ANN-based method provides the optimal parameter estimation results in the range of 0.1 to 30, which facilitates the control of actual false alarm probability. The effectiveness and robustness of DBSCAN-CFAR are also confirmed by the comparisons of conventional CFAR processors in different clutter conditions, comprised of varying target numbers, shape parameters, and false alarm probabilities. Although the proposed ANN-based DBSCAN-CFAR processor incurs more elapsed time, it achieves superior CFAR performance without a prior knowledge on the number and distribution of interference targets.",60016835,Beijing Institute of Technology,Beijing,China,['1701'],29.142857142857142,-0.012857142857142885,0.5626984126984127,1

In recent years, many types of data are used for credit scoring to compensate for the lack of credit history data. Whether social network information can be used to strengthen financial institutions' predictive power has received much attention in the industry and academia.

Three machine learning algorithms-random forest, AdaBoost, and LightGBM-were constructed to demonstrate the predictive performance of social network information.

However, there are many scientific and practical benefits of studying laterality in ungulate livestock.

Increasingly more studies are also focused on associations with age, sex, personality, health, stress, production and performance. Although the full potential of research on laterality in ungulate livestock is not yet exploited, findings have already shed new light on central issues in cognitive and emotional processing and laid the basis for potentially useful applications in future practice, e.g., stress reduction during human-animal interactions and improved assessments of health, production and welfare.

It shows the generation performance of a wind turbine. It plays vital roles in wind power forecasting, wind energy potential estimation, wind turbine selection, and wind turbine condition monitoring.

Although researchers have been extensively studying shape-changing user interfaces, relevant research on its various design aspects—including tools and methods—remains limited. Prototyping shape-changing interfaces often requires sophisticated equipment and knowledge, which makes this sphere of design unwelcoming for designers with limited resources and technical knowledge (e.g., design students). In this study, we propose ClothSurface—a simple and low-cost prototyping tool to design for shape displays—and explore its use through a series of design sessions.

964,964,Strengthening engagement in science understanding with learning trails," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology has developed a learning concept for school classes in science centres named “learning trails”. In this concept, groups of students perform a series of thematically related experiments with installations in the science centre. The learning trails are designed to support the generic learning outcomes for science centre visits. We argue that the previously developed Engagement Profile can be used to translate exhibit properties into both media forms and generic learning outcomes for such learning concepts. Further, we implemented the learning trails in two modes: one mode used paper-based content to guide the students, while the other mode supported the use of tablet PCs where engaging content is triggered when the students approach the location of an experiment in the learning trail. We studied the engagement factors of the learning trails and observed how school classes use these. In a study with 113 students from lower secondary school (age 16), they answered short questionnaires that were integrated into the implementation of the learning trails. While the concept of the learning trails was evaluated positively, we could not find significant differences in how engaging the two implemented modes were.",60080168,Norsk Teknisk Museum,Oslo,Norway,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",24.75,0.07848484848484848,0.3863636363636364,0

However, nonlinear effects of non-optical origin, such as those observed in acoustical and mechanical systems, are many orders of magnitude stronger than optical nonlinearities, and therefore they can be induced with energy that is much lower than that of a laser pulse. Here, we experimentally confirm our theoretical prediction of the possibility to convert giant acoustic and capillary wave nonlinearities into optical signals, thereby effectively reproducing the result of a conventional nonlinear-optical interaction. We excite highly nonlinear capillary Faraday waves on the surface of a thin layer of ethanol and we reflect a beam of low-power, incoherent light from these waves to produce an optical frequency comb.

966,966,Handcrafted versus CNN features for ear recognition,"Ear recognition is an active research area in the biometrics community with the ultimate goal to recognize individuals effectively from ear images. Traditional ear recognition methods based on handcrafted features and conventional machine learning classifiers were the prominent techniques during the last two decades. Arguably, feature extraction is the crucial phase for the success of these methods due to the difficulty in designing robust features to cope with the variations in the given images. Currently, ear recognition research is shifting towards features extracted by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have the ability to learn more specific features robust to the wide image variations and achieving state-of-the-art recognition performance. This paper presents and compares ear recognition models built with handcrafted and CNN features. First, we experiment with seven top performing handcrafted descriptors to extract the discriminating ear image features and then train Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on the extracted features to learn a suitable model. Second, we introduce four CNN based models using a variant of the AlexNet architecture. The experimental results on three ear datasets show the superior performance of the CNN based models by 22%. To further substantiate the comparison, we perform visualization of the handcrafted and CNN features using the t-distributed Stochastic Neighboring Embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique and the characteristics of features are discussed. Moreover, we conduct experiments to investigate the symmetry of the left and right ears and the obtained results on two datasets indicate the existence of a high degree of symmetry between the ears, while a fair degree of asymmetry also exists.",60018830,"South Valley University, Faculty of Science",Qena,Egypt,['1701'],25.7,0.18578095238095238,0.5093142857142858,1

This work shows that a SLM 620 nm laser is firstly achieved using a standing-wave diamond Raman resonator with intracavity second harmonic generation (SHG). In addition to the benefits of the spatial hole burning-free gain medium [1], SHG provides a valuable additional mechanism for increasing gain competition and therefore enhancing SLM stability. Nascent secondary modes experience double the nonlinear loss in the SHG crystal due to the role of sum frequency generation with the primary mode [2]. A further feature of the current external standing-wave cavity design is that the cavity is non-resonant at the pump frequency, thereby allowing the laser to be pumped without mutual control of the wavelength and cavity length and by using multi-longitudinal-mode (MLM) lasers with a spacing different to the free-spectral-range of the diamond Raman laser.",60019544,Macquarie University,Sydney,Australia,['1706'],34.4,0.04000000000000001,0.41888888888888887,0

In predictions, there are always majority and minority classes, and in most cases it is difficult to capture the members of item belonging to the minority classes. This anomaly is traceable to the designs of the predictive algorithms because most algorithms do not factor in the unequal numbers of classes into their designs and implementations. The accuracy of most modeling processes is subjective to the ever-present consequences of the imbalanced classes. This paper employs the variance ranking technique to deal with the real-world class imbalance problem. We augmented this technique using one-versus-all re-coding of the multi-classed datasets.

An excellent meta-heuristic algorithm has two symmetric search capabilities: local search and global search. In this paper, an improved Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is developed by embedding the cross-entropy (CE) method into the original BOA. Based on a co-evolution technique, this new method achieves a proper balance between exploration and exploitation to enhance its global search capability, and effectively avoid it falling into a local optimum.

We assume possibly unbounded costs and a non-stationary exponential form in the discount factor which depends of on a rate, called the discount rate. Given an initial discount rate the evolution in next steps depends on both the previous discount rate and the sojourn time of the system at the current state. The new results provided here are the existence and the approximation of optimal policies for this class of discounted Markov control model with non-stationary rates and the horizon is finite or infinite.

Indeed, chalcogenide fibers can be transparent from the visible up to 12-15 μm, depending on their compositions. The IR signatures of most molecules, including biomolecules, are located in this spectral domain, which allows in situ, non-invasive and real-Time detection of gaz or organics molecules. Indeed, chalcogenide glasses can present a high non-linear coefficient (n2), 100 to 1000 times larger than for silica glass, depending on the composition. An original way to obtain fibers is to design microstructured optical fibers (MOFs). These fibers present unique optical properties thanks to the high degree of freedom in the design of their geometrical structure. Various chalcogenide MOFs operating in the mid-IR range have been elaborated in order to associate the high nonlinear properties of these glasses and the original MOF properties. Different glass compositions and different designs have been achieved depending on the intended application. Indeed, chalcogenide MOFs might lead to new devices with unique optical properties in the Mid-IR domain like multimode or endlessly single mode transmission of light, small or large mode area fibers, non-linear properties for wavelength conversion or generation of supercontinuum sources. In this work, a supercontinuum from 2 to 10 μm, with an average power of 15mW, has been obtained in a chalcogenide MOF by pumping with a supercontinuum generated in a fluoride fiber.",60030553,Universite de Rennes 1,Rennes,France,['1706'],24.6,0.13797854319593447,0.49330321852060977,0

In order to investigate the topological characteristics of power grids, this paper proposes the use of evolutionary algorithms for community detection using modularity density measures on networks representing supergrids in order to discover densely connected structures. Two evolutionary approaches (generational genetic algorithm, GGA+, and modularity and improved genetic algorithm, MIGA) were applied. The results obtained in two large networks representing supergrids (European grid and North American grid) provide insights on both the structure of the supergrid and the topological differences between different regions. Numerical and graphical results show how these evolutionary approaches clearly outperform to the well-known Louvain modularity method. In particular, the average value of modularity obtained by GGA+ in the European grid was 0.815, while an average of 0.827 was reached in the North American grid.

If these variables are correlated with survey estimates, the estimates will benefit from improved precision. With ESS, unbiased estimation of the standard errors of survey estimates is possible, provided that sampling strata membership is identified on the survey dataset. With ISS this is not possible and usual practice is to invoke an approximation that tends to result in systematic over-estimation of standard errors. This can be perceived as a disadvantage of ISS. However, this article demonstrates, both theoretically and through a simulation study, that true standard errors can be smaller with ISS and argues that this advantage may be more important than the ability to obtain unbiased estimates of the standard errors.

The occurrences of ECG arrhythmia alarms among these patients were examined. We found 151 arrhythmia alarms that were generated in 11 patients after comfort care was initiated: 72% were audible, 21% were manually muted, and 7% had an unknown audio label. Level of alarm: 33% crisis, 58% warning, 1% message, and 8% were labeled unknown. Our report shows that ECG monitoring was commonly maintained during the EOL care. Since the goal of care during this phase is for both patient and family comfort, it is important for the clinicians to weigh the benefits versus harms of the continuous ECG monitoring.",60023691,"University of California, San Francisco",San Francisco,United States,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",19.11111111111111,0.0,0.6428571428571429,0
989,989,Towards a deep submicron CMOS image sensor on a standard FDSOI process,"Lab-on-chip is a very promising point-of-care technology, where the specimen is placed directly on a CMOS chip for imaging without the use of any labels or chemicals and with no intervening optical components. However, lab-on-chip technologies developed so far have been limited by the existing pixel size of CMOS image sensors. To be able to accurately resolve small biological samples, the sensor pixel size must be less than the size of the object under examination. For example, bacteria range from 500nm to 5μm and viruses from 30nm to 300nm and thus require image sensors with nanoscale dimensions. However, reducing the size of an image sensor is challenging. Light sensitivity greatly reduces at and below the optical diffraction limit due to increasingly poorer coupling. In addition, CMOS image sensors typically use a refractive microlens that will not scale due to diffraction limits below around 1.4 μm. Further, conventional colour filters are made of absorptive dyes or pigments that do not work at nanometer thicknesses.",60026553,University of Melbourne,Parkville,Australia,['1706'],20.375,0.12425770308123252,0.5161764705882353,1
990,990,Response of natural muscovite to a single femtosecond laser pulse,"Muscovite is a naturally occurring crystalline mineral, a mica, with a unique layered structure with planes of low cleavage energy spaced by ∼1.3 nm in the crystal structure. It is a dielectric insulator. Freshly cleaved muscovite surfaces are extremely flat, clean and used in many technical applications of the material. Previous laser ablation study of mica using ultraviolet, nanosecond duration pulses, led to a poor finish at the process sites (K. Rubahn et.al., J. Appl. Phys. 86(5), 2847, 1999). Interest in laser processing of the material, other than CO2 laser cutting of mica sheets, was subsequently, and not surprisingly, curtailed. Here-in we report the morphologies of the laser processed site affected by a single, ∼150 fs duration, 800nm wavelength, 6 micron spotsize laser pulse focussed on the surface of a mica substrate. A systematic sequence of the morphology as the fluence of the single pulse is increased is obtained. Optical surface profiling and field emission secondary electron microsocopy are used to characterise the site morphology. Time of flight secondary ion mass specroscopy has been used to map the redistribution of key elements at the process site. Muscovite emerges as a fascinating material in its response to a femtosecond laser pulse. Useful marking without creation of debris beyond the footprint of the laser spotsize is achieved at a flunece as low as 2.4 J/cm2. There is evidence of plasticity and cavitation within the sequence of morphologies found.",60028333,University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia,Sydney,Australia,['1706'],14.75,0.010551948051948042,0.4270562770562771,1
991,991,The longitudinal item count technique: A new technique for asking sensitive questions in surveys," As alternative, some have proposed using the Item Count Technique (ICT). The problem with ICT methods is that these can have low statistical efficiency, but also do not provide an indicator of the behavior at the respondent level. We propose a new variant of the ICT to overcome these issues: the Longitudinal Item Count Technique (LICT). Instead of administering different lists (one including the sensitive item and one without) to two random groups in a single survey, the LICT administers both lists to each respondent, but at different survey waves. The sensitive attribute can be estimated as the difference within individuals across waves. Like the ICT, the LICT can be extended to a two-list version. In this paper we discuss the assumptions, implementation, limitations, and ethical implications of this novel technique, and present application of the method in the Understanding Society Innovation Panel, estimating the prevalence of the gay, lesbian, and bisexual population in the United Kingdom. In this first application, the LICT in some ways appeared to provide better estimates than the traditional ICT, but also provided some inconsistency in estimates.

993,993,Application and evaluation of surrogate models for radiation source search,"Surrogate models are increasingly required for applications in which first-principles simulation models are prohibitively expensive to employ for uncertainty analysis, design, or control. They can also be used to approximate models whose discontinuous derivatives preclude the use of gradient-based optimization or data assimilation algorithms. We consider the problem of inferring the 2D location and intensity of a radiation source in an urban environment using a ray-tracing model based on Boltzmann transport theory. Whereas the code implementing this model is relatively efficient, extension to 3D Monte Carlo transport simulations precludes subsequent Bayesian inference to infer source locations, which typically requires thousands to millions of simulations. Additionally, the resulting likelihood exhibits discontinuous derivatives due to the presence of buildings. To address these issues, we discuss the construction of surrogate models for optimization, Bayesian inference, and uncertainty propagation. Specifically, we consider surrogate models based on Legendre polynomials, multivariate adaptive regression splines, radial basis functions, Gaussian processes, and neural networks.

To quantitatively evaluate a tumor's malignancy from brain magnetic resonance imaging, this study proposed a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Gliomas from a multi-center database (The Cancer Imaging Archive) composed of a total of 30 grade 2, 43 grade 3, and 57 grade 4 gliomas were used for the training and evaluation of the proposed CAD. Using transfer learning to fine-tune AlexNet, a DCNN, its internal layers, and parameters trained from a million images were transferred to learn how to differentiate the acquired gliomas. Data augmentation was also implemented to increase possible spatial and geometric variations for a better training model. The transferred DCNN achieved an accuracy of 97.9% with a standard deviation of 1% and an area under the receiver operation characteristics curve (Az) of 0.9991 ± 0, which were superior to handcrafted image features, the DCNN without pretrained features, which only achieved a mean accuracy of 61.42% with a standard deviation of 7% and a mean Az of 0.8222 ± 0.07, and the DCNN without data augmentation, which was the worst with a mean accuracy of 59.85% with a standard deviation 16% and a mean Az of 0.7896±0.18.

This paper presents a systematic review of Accessible Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs) in inclusive music practice. History of research concerned with facilitating inclusion in music-making is outlined, and current state of developments and trends in the field are discussed. Although the use of music technology in music therapy contexts has attracted more attention in recent years, the topic has been relatively unexplored in Computer Music literature. This review investigates a total of 113 publications focusing on ADMIs. Based on the 83 instruments in this dataset, ten control interface types were identified: tangible controllers, touchless controllers, Brain–Computer Music Interfaces (BCMIs), adapted instruments, wearable controllers or prosthetic devices, mouth-operated controllers, audio controllers, gaze controllers, touchscreen controllers and mouse-controlled interfaces. The majority of the AMDIs were tangible or physical controllers. Although the haptic modality could potentially play an important role in musical interaction for many user groups, relatively few of the ADMIs (15.6%) incorporated vibrotactile feedback.

A symmetrical depletion-type Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and driver amplifier are intended for electro-optical (E/O) integrated transmitters. The optical divider and combiner of MZM are designed based on the self-imaging theory and then simulated with EM software. In order to verify the correctness of the theory and material properties used in the simulation, a short test (prototype) MZM of 1.9 mm length is produced and measured. It shows an extinction ratio of 19 dB and half-wave voltage-length product of Vπ L = ~1.5 V•cm. Based on these results, the construction of the segmented modulator with several driver amplifier units is defined. The designed driver amplifier unit provides a bandwidth of more than 30 GHz, saturated output power of 6 dBm (output voltage of Vpp = 1.26 V), and matching better than-15 dB up to 35 GHz; it dissipates 170 mW of power and occupies an area of 0.4 x 0.38 mm2. The optical-electrical (O/E) receiver consists of a Ge-photodiode, transimpedance amplifier (TIA), and passive optical structures that are integrated on a single chip.

The optical fluorescence enhancement experimental results are obtained using custom made IR confocal microscope to measure integrated PL of up to a factor of 20 compared to bulk material.

We contribute to both of these by measuring five transitions from the 23P2 state, improving on Martin's measurements with an order of magnitude greater precision, and making the first observation of the spin-forbidden 23P2 → 51D2 transition in Helium.

A new nonlinear coupling control method based on improved energy is proposed in this paper. We define coupled control signal among trolley, hook and payload. An improved energy storage function is established based on the new coupling control signal. Consequently, a nonlinear anti-swing controller is constructed straightforwardly, and the closed-loop system stability is subject to strict mathematics analysis by Lyapunov and LaSalle' s theorem. Moreover, the new energy function based on the coupling behaving between the trolley motion and the payload swing leads to the improved control performance. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed method has better performance than traditional controllers. It not only effectively suppresses the swing of the load and the hook, but also precisely controls the displacement of the trolley. It has strong robustness to the displacement of the payload, the change of the gantry crane parameters and the external disturbance.",60119040,The State Key Laboratory of Rolling and Automation,Shenyang,China,['1701'],18.3,0.12259358288770053,0.5699197860962566,1
1004,1004,Shock waves asymmetry in a symmetric nozzle,"The results of the experimental research on the symmetry of supersonic flow in a symmetric convergent-divergent nozzle are presented. The investigations were focused on the fact that for some flow conditions the flow in a precisely symmetric nozzle becomes asymmetric. Starting from a specific value of Mach number, the flow becomes asymmetric in terms of shock wave-foot geometry on both sides of a symmetric nozzle. The evolution of the abovementioned asymmetry has been analysed for Mach number value ranging from M = 1.26 to M = 1.59 with the nozzle opening angle of up to 6.5° on each side. The presented results indicate that for the same flow parameters as Mach number and Reynolds number, and for the same geometry of the nozzle, different λ-foot size is formed at each wall. This unexpected behaviour is responsible for the flow asymmetry. Numerical simulations carried out earlier confirm the appearance of shock wave asymmetry. The side in which the asymmetry takes place is accidental, as the full symmetry of simulation mesh and experiment setup was secured. In numerical simulation the asymmetry follows always the same direction. In experiments the direction of asymmetry happens alternatively without any apparent reason.

1006,1006,Partial pre-emphasis for pluggable 400 g short-reach coherent systems,"Pre-emphasis filters are used to pre-compensate for the transmitter frequency response of coherent systems to mitigate receiver noise enhancement. This is particularly essential for low-cost, low-power coherent transceivers due to having an extremely bandlimited transmitter. However, the pre-emphasis filter also increases the signal peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), thus posing a higher effective number of bits (ENoB) requirement for the arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). In this paper, we first numerically study the PAPR impact of partial pre-emphasis filters. We show that with partial pre-emphasis, an ENoB reduction from 5 to 4.5 bits is attainable at the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) out of the AWG. Next, we experimentally investigate the overall performance penalty of partial pre-emphasis in a 50 Gbaud 16QAM coherent system.

A long short-term memory-deep neural network (LSTM-DNN) algorithm is proposed for gate detection. Compared with the traditional threshold algorithm and the LSTM, the proposed algorithm has higher detection accuracy for different walking speeds and different test subjects. During the identification process, the acceleration signals obtained from the acceleration sensors were normalized to ensure that the different features had the same scale.

1009,1009,A hybrid active filter using the backstepping controller for harmonic current compensation,"This document presents a new hybrid combination of filters using passive and active elements because of the generalization in the use of non-linear loads that generate harmonics directly affecting the symmetry of energy transmission systems that influence the functioning of the electricity grid and, consequently, the deterioration of power quality. In this context, active power filters represent one of the best solutions for improving power quality and compensating harmonic currents to get a symmetrical waveform. In addition, given the importance and occupation of the transmission network, it is necessary to control the stability of the system. Traditionally, passive filters were used to improve energy quality, but they have endured problems such as resonance, fixed remuneration, etc. In order to mitigate these problems, a hybrid HAPF active power filter is proposed combining a parallel active filter and a passive filter controlled by a backstepping algorithm strategy. This control strategy is compared with two other methods, namely the classical PI control, and the fuzzy logic control in order to verify the eectiveness and the level of symmetry of the backstepping controller proposed for the HAPF. The proposed backstepping controller inspires the notion of stability in Lyapunov's sense. This work is carried out to improve the performance of the HAPF by the backstepping command.

1010,1010,Application of the gravitational search algorithm for constructing fuzzy classifiers of imbalanced data,"The presence of imbalance in data significantly complicates the classification task, including fuzzy systems. Due to a large number of instances of bigger classes, instances of smaller classes are not recognized correctly. Therefore, additional tools for improving the quality of classification are required. The most common methods for handling imbalanced data have several disadvantages. For example, methods for generating additional instances of minority classes can worsen classification if there is a strong overlap of instances from different classes. Methods that directly modify the fuzzy classification algorithm lead to a decline in the interpretability of the model. In this paper, we study the efficiency of the gravitational search algorithm in the tasks of selecting the features and tuning the term parameters for fuzzy classifiers of imbalanced data. We consider only data with two classes and apply the algorithm based on extreme values of classes to construct models with a minimum number of rules. In addition, we propose a new quality metric based on the sum of the overall accuracy and the geometric mean with the presence of a priority coefficient between them.",60010892,Tomsk State University of Control Systems and Radioelectronics,Tomsk,Russian Federation,['1701'],20.11111111111111,0.05603016774891775,0.5346218885281385,1
1011,1011,An optical fiber microprobe for surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensing with enhanced signal-to-background ratio,"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a highly sensitive and versatile analytical technique that can be implemented on an optical fiber platform for use in challenging environments. This work has sought to address a major factor limiting the use of optical fibers for SERS analytical applications, namely the silica Raman background generated inside the fiber can make it difficult to detect the target analyte. Two different approaches were investigated to address this problem. Firstly, double clad fiber (DCF) was found to increase the collection of Raman scattered signal from the analyte, giving up to twelve-fold improvement in the signal-to-background ratio (SBR). Secondly, a prototype microfilter was manufactured by femtosecond laser machining and attached directly to the DCF tip. Its performance in rejecting background signal was then evaluated. When taking the lengths of the optical fibers into account, the filtered DCF microprobe delivers 7.0 SBR.cm, while the bare DCF probe provided 3.0 SBR.cm. Therefore, the microfilter assembly more than doubled the performance of the SERS probe and, with further optimization in future, it shows great promise for ultra-compact SERS and Raman optical fiber probes.",123924419,ARC Training Centre in Biodevices,Hawthorn,Australia,['1706'],22.75,0.12403846153846154,0.49038461538461536,1

1014,1014,Modified advanced encryption standard algorithm for information security,"The wide acceptability of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the most efficient of all of the symmetric cryptographic techniques has further opened it up to more attacks. Efforts that were aimed at securing information while using AES is still being undermined by the activities of attackers This has further necessitated the need for researchers to come up with ways of enhancing the strength of AES. This article presents an enhanced AES algorithm that was achieved by modifying its SubBytes and ShiftRows transformations. The SubBytes transformation is modified to be round key dependent, while the ShiftRows transformation is randomized. The rationale behind the modification is to make the two transformations round key dependent, so that a single bit change in the key will produce a significant change in the cipher text. The conventional and modified AES algorithms are both implemented and evaluated in terms avalanche effect and execution time. The modified AES algorithm achieved an avalanche effect of 57.81% as compared to 50.78 recorded with the conventional AES. However, with 16, 32, 64, and 128 plain text bytes, the modified AES recorded an execution time of 0.18, 0.31, 0.46, and 0.59 ms, respectively. This is slightly higher than the results obtained with the conventional AES.

But it still has many shortcomings in theory and application.

The optical properties are typically observed on the macroscopic scale. To broaden their application, fabrication and char-acterization of conducting polymers on the nanoscale thickness are required. In this study microscale volume poly(3,4-ethylenedioxytiophene)-Tosylate (PEDOT:Tos) layers are fabricated at the tip of a single mode optical fibre without the need for intermediate layers such as Indium Tin Oxide. This allows for optical interrogation (primarily at 1550 nm) of the properties and behaviour of PEDOT:Tos below thicknesses of 500 nm. The optical response (transmission and back-reflection) of the PEDOT:Tos obtained by exposure to different oxidant solu-tion is measured. The effect of different oxidant solution on conductivity, thermal conductivity and degradation time will be examined.

However, this can lead to inaccurate and untimely diagnoses, since an infection might be present without obvious symptoms. This would commonly require removal of any dressing that might be present, which can cause further pain to the patient. Therefore, there is a need for more precise methods of detecting infections, with minimal effects to the patient. Comparison of temperature differences between infected tissue and healthy tissue shows an increase ranging from 3-4 °C, while normal skin has a temperature gradient of ±1 °C. Hence, monitoring temperature of wounds can be used to detect the presence of an infection. Nanodiamonds (NDs) containing negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centres are capable of monitoring changes in temperature with minimal influence by environmental factors such as pH, ion concentration or molecular interaction. This study looks at encapsulating these NDs into silk fibres for use as a wound dressing that can monitor temperature changes in the wound, without requiring the removal of the dressing. To further enhance the wound healing and anti-bacterial properties, curcumin was also incorporated into the silk fibres. Curcumin is one of the active ingredients in turmeric and is known to significantly enhance wound healing through its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. This study used this curcumin-nanodiamond-silk hybrid wound dressing to investigate the healing capabilities and temperature sensing properties for use as a wound dressing.",60011362,RMIT University,Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],22.454545454545453,0.05125,0.47625,1

In this work, we propose a novel approach towards automatically learning object categorization taking into consideration learning object usage information. We use a multi-label learning approach since each learning object might be associated with multiple categories. We have developed a methodology with three main stages allowing us to firstly select the most suitable set of text features from learning objects metadata, secondly selecting how much historical learning object usage information can enhance classification performance, and finally selecting the best multi­label classification algorithms with our data.

1023,1023,Extracting production rules for cerebrovascular examination dataset through mining of non-anomalous association rules," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Today, patients generate a massive amount of health records through electronic health records (EHRs). Extracting usable knowledge of patients' pathological conditions or diagnoses is essential for the reasoning process in rule-based systems to support the process of clinical decision making. Association rule mining is capable of discovering hidden interesting knowledge and relations among attributes in datasets, including medical datasets, yet is more likely to produce many anomalous rules (i.e., subsumption and circular redundancy) depends on the predefined threshold, which lead to logical errors and aects the reasoning process of rule-based systems. Therefore, the challenge is to develop a method to extract concise rule bases and improve the coverage of non-anomalous rule bases, i.e., one that not only reduces anomalous rules but also finds the most comprehensive rules from the dataset. In this study, we generated non-anomalous association rules (NAARs) from a cerebrovascular examination dataset through several steps: obtaining a frequent closed itemset, generating association rule bases, subsumption checking, and circularity checking, to fit production rules (PRs) in rule-based systems. Toward the end, the rule inferencing part was performed by PROLOG to obtain possible conclusions toward a specific query given by a user.

The proposed system employs cost-effective alternative motion capture combined with the system’s immersive 3D virtual gait analysis clinic.

Several systems have been devised to detect driver fatigue symptoms, such as measuring physiological parameters, which can be uncomfortable, or using a video or infrared camera pointed at the driver’s face, which in some cases, may cause privacy concerns for the driver. Usually these systems are expensive, therefore a brief discussion on low-cost fatigue detection systems is presented, followed by a proposal for a non-intrusive low-cost prototype, that aims to detect driver fatigue symptoms.

Previous studies have shown that to improve prediction accuracy, more heterogeneous measurements provide better results. So what other factors should be added into the prediction model? Traditional prediction methods mainly use the arrival time and the distance between stations, but do not make full use of dynamic factors such as passenger number, dwell time, bus driving efficiency, etc. We propose a novel approach that takes full advantage of dynamic factors. Our approach is based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The experimental results indicate that a variety of prediction algorithms (such as Support Vector Machine, Kalman filter, Multilayer Perceptron, and RNN) have significantly improved performance after using dynamic factors. Further, we introduce RNN with an attention mechanism to adaptively select the most relevant input factors. Experiments demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of RNN with an attention mechanism is better Than RNN with no attention mechanism when there are heterogeneous input factors.

1031,1031,Reinforcement learning based query routing approach for P2P systems,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have offered users an efficient way to share various resources and access diverse services over the Internet. In unstructured P2P systems, resource storage and indexation are fully distributed among participating peers. Therefore, locating peers sharing pertinent resources for a specific user query is a challenging issue. In fact, effective query routing requires smart decisions to select a certain number of peers with respect to their relevance for the query instead of choosing them at random. In this respect, we introduce here a new query-oriented approach, called the reinforcement learning-based query routing approach (RLQR). The main goal of RLQR is to reach high retrieval effectiveness as well as a lower search cost by reducing the number of exchanged messages and contacted peers. To achieve this, the RLQR relies on information gathered from previously sent queries to identify relevant peers for forthcoming queries. Indeed, we formulate the query routing issue as the reinforcement learning problem and introduce a fully distributed approach for addressing it. In addition, RLQR addresses the well-known cold-start issue during the training stage, which allows it to improve its retrieval effectiveness and search cost continuously, and, therefore, goes quickly through the cold-start phase. Performed simulations demonstrate that RLQR outperforms pioneering query routing approaches in terms of retrieval effectiveness and communications cost.",60104697,Northern Border University,Arar,Saudi Arabia,['1705'],21.5,0.15832833832833831,0.5410639360639361,1

Frequency response function (FRF) analyses were used to identify the resonant frequencies and corresponding modes of the different FEM models, and the obtained results were compared with experimental data to get the model validation. Subsequently, modal-based frequency forced response analyses were performed to consider the loads acting during the real operating conditions of the engine. Finally, the impact on vibrations at the mounts, produced by an additional bracket connecting the engine block and gearbox, was also investigated. Both the full and reduced FEM model demonstrated and reproduced with high accuracy the vibration response at the engine mounts, providing a satisfactory agreement with the vibrations measured experimentally.

This study proposes the use of a probabilistic time-dependent FMEA (TD-FMEA) approach to overcome limitations encountered during implementation of traditional FMEA approaches. To this end, the proposed method defines the risk priority metric (RPM) as a priority decision value. RPM corresponds to the product of the expected loss and occurrence rate of the failure-cause. By assuming exponential and case functions for each occurrence and detection time instant, the expected loss corresponding to each failure-cause can be evaluated.

1036,1036,Photon counting statistics of a microwave cavity coupled with double quantum dots," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The statistical properties of photon emission counting, especially the waiting time distributions (WTDs) and large deviation statistics, of a cavity coupled with the system of double quantum dots (DQDs) driven by an external microwave field were investigated with the particle-number-resolved master equation. The results show that the decay rate of the WTDs of the cavity for short and long time limits can be effectively tuned by the driving external field Rabi frequency, the frequency of the cavity photon, and the detuning between the microwave driving frequency and the energy-splitting of the DQDs. The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction.

1037,1037,Tailoring directional scattering of second-harmonic generation from (111)-GaAs nanoantennas," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.The group of zincblende III-V compound semiconductors, especially (100)-grown AlGaAs and GaAs, have recently been presented as promising materials for second harmonic generation (SHG) at the nanoscale. However, major obstacles to push the technology towards practical applications are the limited control over directionality of the SH emission and especially zero forward/backward radiation. In this work we provide both theoretically and experimentally a solution to these problems by presenting the first SHG nanoantennas made from (111)-GaAs embedded in a low index material. These nanoantennas show superior forward directionality compared to their (100)-counterparts. Most importantly, it is possible to manipulate the SHG radiation pattern of the nanoantennas by changing the pump polarization without affecting the linear properties and the total nonlinear conversion efficiency.",60029507,Friedrich Schiller Universität Jena,Jena,Germany,['1706'],26.2,0.09947478991596638,0.469187675070028,0
1038,1038,Surface topography-based positioning accuracy of maxillary templates fabricated by the CAD/CAM technique for orthognathic surgery without an intermediate splint,"Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-based maxillary templates can transfer a surgical plan accurately only when the template is positioned correctly. Our study aimed to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the CAD/CAM-based template for maxillary orthognathic surgery using dry skulls. After reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual skull model, a surface-based surgical template for Le Fort I osteotomy was designed and fabricated using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology. To determine accuracy, the deviation of the template between the planned and the actual position and the fitness of the template were evaluated. The mean deviation was 0.41 ± 0.30 mm in the medio-lateral direction, 0.55 ± 0.59 mm in the antero-posterior direction, and 0.69 ± 0.59 mm in the supero-inferior direction. The root mean square deviation between the planned and the actual position of the template was 1.21 ± 0.54 mm. With respect to the fitness of the template, the mean distance between the inner surface of the template and the underlying bone surface was 0.76 ± 0.24 mm. CAD/CAM-based templates showed precise positioning and good fitness. These results suggest that surface topography-based CAD-CAM templates can be considered as an alternative solution in replacing the traditional intermediate splints for the transfer of surgical plans.",60007215,Chonnam National University,Gwangju,South Korea,['1706'],22.333333333333332,0.00798611111111111,0.5774305555555556,1
1039,1039,Principle of exhausting trademark rights: Challenges and prospects,". All rights reserved.The exhaustion of trademark rights should be recognized as a special case of the free use of a trademark and a peculiar restriction of the trademark holder’s monopoly with respect to the already sold goods. However, the use of a trademark should be restricted in accordance with the requirements of strict necessity, avoiding the deception of consumers regarding the legal and economic relations between the parallel importer and the trademark holder. Based on analyzing the European judicial practice, it has been concluded about limiting the principle of the trademark rights exhaustion in order to prevent unfair competition in the goods market. The holder’s right to prohibit the sale of goods this holder entered into the civil circulation and marked with their trademark, if this happens for legitimate reasons, in particular, when changes are made to the goods and cause the quality deterioration or a risk of deceiving the consumer, has been proved. The use of this approach is explained by the need to maintain the business reputation of the rights holder. After putting the original goods into civil circulation by the rights holder, the parallel importer has the right to resell them, but does not have the right to impersonate the holder of the trademark that individualizes the goods entered into circulation. In order to maintain the balance of rights and legitimate interests of rights holders and parallel importers, it has been suggested to prohibit the parallel import of goods to a certain country if the rights holder has entered into a license agreement under the exclusive license with a specific business entity in that country.",60032982,Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation,Moscow,Russian Federation,['1700'],33.625,0.13167989417989417,0.37546296296296294,1

All rights reserved.In the Southeast agroclimatic area of the Nizhniy Novgorod region, the evolutionary formation and functioning of 51 parasitic systems have been retrospectively established, the co-actants of which, in addition to their pathogens, were productive and nonproductive domestic and wild animals. For the entire depth of retrospection (82 years), eleven nozologic units of contagious pathologies in the animals in the region (21.6%) were found dominant in terms of both the number of epizootic foci and the number of infected animals (rabies, dictyocaulosis, infectious atrophic rhinitis, classical pig plague, piroplasmosis, salmonellosis, swine eruption, anthrax, fascioliasis, blackleg, and contagious aphtha). Their share in the nosologic profile of infectious pathology in animals was 241 epizootic outbreaks (68.5% of the total number of the epizootic foci of infectious diseases in animals in the region at the depth of retrospection). At the same time, over the entire period of retrospection, 13 nosologic units in the studied area have been identified once, no extension of the boundaries of their epidemic manifestations has been identified, and the carry-over of the pathogen of these infectious diseases beyond the primary epizootic focus has been prevented. Relapses of their epizootic phenomena in the region have also been prevented. Ten nosologic units of contagious pathology in animals (18%) in the total pathology in the animals in the studied area during the entire period of retrospection have been identified twice (chicken typhoid, pig and cattle taeniasis, pig metastrongylosis, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, chicken ascaridiasis, cattle parainfluenza, Nosema disease).In the study zone, potential danger of spontaneous emergence and spreading of contagious diseases in animals (anthrax, blackleg, bovine tuberculosis, fascioliasis, classic and African swine fever, piroplasmosis, echinococcosis, and rabies) has also been identified. Schematic models of the potential threat of the epizootic component of the biological hazards in the region have been built.

1044,1044,Highly efficient modulation of upconversion luminescence at a millisecond timescale," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.The highly efficient modulation of the luminescence from upconversion nanoparticles combined with graphene oxide in a thin film was achieved at a millisecond timescale through the photochemical reduction of graphene oxide under UV irradiation. The experimental design comprised the integration of the upconversion nanoparticles with graphene oxide to form a reproducible and scalable thin film. This design enabled convenient testing of the sample with a home-built optical system setup comprising an UV CW laser at 375 nm for the photochemical reduction of graphene oxide and a near-infrared CW laser at 980 nm for the excitation of the upconversion nanoparticles. The recovery of the graphene-like structure through the photochemical reduction of graphene oxide was accompanied by a variation in the absorption coefficient of the thin film, which enabled super-quenching of the luminescence from the upconversion nanoparticles under near-infrared excitation with values of up to ∼90%. Further, the instantaneous reduction in the intensity upon UV irradiation offered decreased modulation time of upconversion luminescence down to milliseconds at microwatt-level power. Optical patterning was successfully produced in the thin film: representations of a leaf, the Sydney Opera House and a kangaroo were fabricated in the thin film and recovered by raster scanning the sample. The resulting patterns had high spatial resolution for upconversion luminescence modulation down to the diffraction limit for the considered wavelengths.

1050,1050,Symmetry breaking: Balancing asymmetries," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon where a system characterized by certain symmetries can evolve into a state that does not exhibit those symmetries. SSB underpins many fundamental phenomena, including phase transitions in meta-materials or Bose-Einstein condensates, the emergence of the Nambu-Goldstone and Higgs modes of crucial importance in particle physics, or bifurcations in lasers, and could have significant applications, especially in photonics. Physical systems however often exhibit deviations from perfect symmetry because of naturally occurring imperfections. How small asymmetries affect SSB-related dynamics is therefore an important problem. Surprisingly, this has barely been considered in experiments, and even then restricted to situations with only one asymmetry parameter. Here, we report spontaneous breaking of a mirror symmetry in an optical experiment with two controllable asymmetry parameters. Specifically, we explore how controlled asymmetries affect the range of co-existence of two homogeneous states (HSs) with different polarizations in a driven Kerr resonator, and discover that different asymmetries can compensate for each other. In particular, we show that we can restore a standard pitchfork-like response characteristics of SSB under asymmetric conditions.",60138556,Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire Carnot de Bourgogne,Dijon,France,['1706'],23.75,0.18242630385487527,0.5713151927437642,0

In this paper, we proposed a human visual perception-based multi-exposure fusion image quality assessment method by considering the related perceptual features (i.e., color, dense scale invariant feature transform (DSIFT) and exposure) to measure the quality degradation accurately, which is closely related to the symmetry principle in human eyes. Firstly, the L1 norm of chrominance components between fused images and the designed pseudo images with the most severe color attenuation is calculated to measure the global color degradation, and the color saturation similarity is added to eliminate the influence of color over-saturation. Secondly, a set of distorted images under different exposure levels with strong edge information of fused image is constructed through the structural transfer, thus DSIFT similarity and DSIFT saturation are computed to measure the local detail loss and enhancement, respectively. Thirdly, Gauss exposure function is used to detect the over-exposure or under-exposure areas, and the above perceptual features are aggregated with random forest to predict the final quality of fused image.

It is based on the multiple real dominant pole method, applicable to both standard and series PID control. In the latter case it may be generalized by using binomial nth order filters. These offer filtering properties scalable in a much broader range than those allowed by a standard controller. It is shown that in terms of a modified total variance, controllers with higher order binomial filters allow a significant reduction of excessive control effort due to the measurement noise. When not limited by the sampling period choice, a significant performance increase may be achieved by using third order filters, which can be further boosted using higher order filters. Furthermore, all of the derived tuning procedures keep the controller design sufficiently simple so as to be attractive for industrial applications.

Because of the rapid development of image acquisition which will increase the image size, and in turn requires bigger storage space. JPEG has been considered as the most famous and applicable algorithm for image compression; however, it has shortfalls for some image types. Hence, new techniques are required to improve the quality of reconstructed images as well as to increase the compression ratio. The work in this paper introduces a scheme to enhance the JPEG algorithm. The proposed scheme is a new method which shrinks and stretches images using a smooth filter. In order to remove the blurring artifact which would be developed from shrinking and stretching the image, a hyperbolic function (tanh) is used to enhance the quality of the reconstructed image. Furthermore, the new approach achieves higher compression ratio for the same image quality, and/or better image quality for the same compression ratio than ordinary JPEG with respect to large size and more complex content images. However, it is an application for optimization to enhance the quality (PSNR and SSIM), of the reconstructed image and to reduce the size of the compressed image, especially for large size images.",60071164,Mustansiriyah University,Baghdad,Iraq,['1703'],22.88888888888889,0.19688311688311688,0.508538961038961,0

1061,1061,A multi-subpopulation bat optimization algorithm for economic dispatch problem with non-essential demand response," All rights reserved.In this paper, we propose a new economic dispatch model with random wind power, demand response and carbon tax. The specific feature of the demand response model is that the consumer’s electricity demand is divided into two parts: necessary part and non-essential part. The part of the consumer’s participation in the demand response is the non-essential part of the electricity consumption. The optimal dispatch objective is to obtain the minimum total cost (fuel cost, random wind power cost and emission cost) and the maximum consumer’s non-essential demand response benefit while satisfying some given constraints. In order to solve the optimal dispatch objective, a multi-subpopulation bat optimization algorithm (MSPBA) is proposed by using different search strategies. Finally, a case of an economic dispatch model is given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the established mathematical model and proposed algorithm. The economic dispatch model includes three thermal generators, two wind turbines and two consumers.

Ukrainian gas transmision system (GTS) as a part of the whole oil and gas complex takes the important role in energy security of the state. Taking into consideration the aging and physical deterioration procesess, a lot of attentionn today is paid to the question of ensuring GTS relaible operation and maintenance. Problem Statement. All innovations and technicaogical achievements, implemented into GTS are impossible without a detailed study of productivity of GTS facilities, the costs for implementing the new standards, and the costs for eliminating the emergency situations' consequences. Purpose. Assessment and evaluation of data on efficiency of Ukrainian GTS, based on the implementation of new standards on technical diagnostics and control (TDC), influencing significantly on the operation of GTS facilities. Materials and Methods. For the analysis, we chose the complex mathematical model, allowing to determine the qualitative relationship between the productivity of GTS facilities, the costs of implementing new standards for technical diagnostics and control, and the costs for eliminating the consequences of economic, environmental and other impacts. Besides the expert evaluation method and numerical Runge-Kutt methods were applied for practical use of the proposed model. Results. The efficiency of GTS operation, according to the proposed model, depends on the costs, spent for the implementation of standards. Among the benefits for increasing of standards expenditures are the growth of emergency response funding, which tends to decreasing in timely manner. Calculation results showed the adequacy of the proposed experts' assessment model according to the question of objectivity, impartiality and consistency of expert opinions. Conclusions. The complex of mathematical calculations maintained the qualitative picture of the relationship between selected characteristics.

For the measurement of distance of two surfaces, the positioning method is the key for realizing high precision. A practical method with nanometer positioning precision is introduced in consideration of the complexity of positioning laser sources of the traditional methods and new methods. The surface positioning is realized by the combination of laser interference and white light interference. In order to verify the method, a 0.1 mm height step is made, and an experiment system based on the method is established. The principle and the basic theory of the method are analyzed, and the measures to enhance the repeatability from optical and mechanical factors and signal processing methods are presented. The experimental result shows that the surface positioning repeatability is in the order of 10 nm. The measurement uncertainty evaluation shows that the standard uncertainty is 21 nm for a 0.1 mm step.

A superposition approach combining with the solution structure theorems is used to get a solution for equation of hyperbolic heat conduction. In this solution, a complex origin problem is divided into, different, easier subproblems which can actually be integrated to take the solution of the first problem. The first problem is split into three sub-problems by setting the term of heat generation, the initial conditions, and the boundary condition with specified value in each sub-problem. This method provides a precise and convenient solution to the equation of non-Fourier heat conduction. The results show that at low times (t = 0.1) up to about r = 0.4, the contribution of T1 and T3 dominate compared to T2 contributing little to the overall temperature.

For that purpose, Lyapunov-like functions and interval analysis are combined in a novel manner. To demonstrate the proposed techniques for enclosing invariant sets, the systems examined in this paper are controlled via sliding mode techniques with subsequently enclosing the invariant sets by an interval based set inversion technique.

The acceleration of their differentiation should be beneficial to their clinical application. Therefore, a conductive polypyrrole (PPy)-made electrical stimulation (ES) device was fabricated to provide direct-current electric field (DCEF) treatment, and its effect on osteo-differentiation of hDPSCs was investigated in this study. To determine the optimal treating time, electrical field of 0.33 V/cm was applied to hDPSCs once for 4 h on different days after the osteo-induction. The alizarin red S staining results suggested that ES accelerated the mineralization rates of hDPSCs. The quantification analysis results revealed a nearly threefold enhancement in calcium deposition by ES at day 0, 2, and 4, whereas the promotion effect in later stages was in vain. To determine the ES-mediated signaling pathway, the expression of genes in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family and related receptors were quantified using qPCR. In the early stages of osteo-differentiation, the mRNA levels of BMP2, BMP3, BMP4, and BMP5 were increased significantly in the ES groups, indicating that these genes were involved in the specific signaling routes induced by ES.

1090,1090,Optomechanical micro-structures for single-crystal diamond," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.The optomechanical interaction between photonic and phononic waves in micron scale devices is increasingly becoming important for ultrasensitive force and mass sensing applications. Diamond is an exception material for the coupling of optical and mechanical modes because of the low absorption in visible spectrum and high mechanical modulus. To generate optomechanical coupling it is essential to achieve mechanical resonances in the GHz range. Previous work has shown that it is possible to achieve acoustic band gaps at such high frequencies by high-order band gaps which exploit periodic structures with novel topologies. In this work we investigate how the topology and geometry of the periodic structures influence the photon and phonon mode-confinement as well as the optomechanical coupling. By changing the topology and geometry of a unit cell structure based the properties of the targeted Bloch mode, both the resonant mode frequencies and the bandwidth can be tuned. The design method is able to achieve structures with quite large gap sizes for out-of-plane wave, in-plane wave, and the combined waves, which introduces more controllable mechanical modes in the cavity designs in diamond for strong coupling effects.",60030804,Swinburne University of Technology,Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],27.857142857142858,0.18935374149659862,0.5559693877551021,0

Frequency variation in the VCO has been achieved by changing the capacitance of the output node with the use of an IMOS varactor comprised of two NMOS transistors connected in parallel. The VCO circuit uses a CMOS inverter and output frequency tuning that has been attained by varying the back-gate voltage (Vsb) and source/drain voltage (Vct) of the IMOS varactor. Supply voltage variations from 1 V to 3 V achieves a tuning range from 0.280 GHz to 1.163 GHz along with power dissipation of 0.003 mW to 3.290 mW. Source/drain voltage (Vct) variations from 0.1 V to 1.5 V achieve a tuning range of 0.685 GHz to 0.816 GHz along with power dissipation of 0.465 mW. Furthermore, the frequency varies from 0.810 GHz to 0.843 GHz with back-gate voltage (Vsb) tuning of the IMOS varactor. The results were obtained with different IMOS varactor widths and various combinations of supply voltages to achieve output frequency, power dissipation as well as phase noise. The VCO shows a phase noise of-102.81 dBc/Hz@1MHz and a figure of merit (FoM) is-162.10 dBc/Hz.

Conflicts are increasingly asymmetrical, networked, urbanized and open to the global publicities because of internet global connections and especially global access to the social media. The public-driven network-based global possibility to online communication means threats and the nature of conflict to become “hybrid.” “Hybrid warfare” challenges the standard way of waging military operations.

1099,1099,Willingness of online panelists to perform additional tasks,"People’s willingness to share data with researchers is the fundamental raw material for most social science research.

Less is known about people’s willingness to share these other kinds of data. In this study, we aim to: 1) provide information about the willingness of people to share different types of data; 2) explore the reasons for their acceptance or refusal, and 3) try to determine which variables affect the willingness to perform these additional tasks. We use data from a survey implemented in 2016 in Spain, in which around 1,400 panelists of the Netquest online access panel were asked about their hypothetical willingness to share different types of data: passive measurement on devices they already use; wearing special devices to passively monitor activity; providing them with measurement devices and then having them self-report the results; providing physical specimens or bodily fluids (e.g. saliva); others. Open questions were used to follow up on the reasons for acceptance or refusal in the case of the use of a tracker. Our results suggest that the acceptance level is quite low in general, but there are large differences across tasks and respondents. The main reasons justifying both acceptance and refusal are related to privacy, security and trust.

1101,1101,An analysis of the dynamical behaviour of systems with fractional damping for mechanical engineering applications,"Fractional derivative models are widely used to easily characterise more complex damping behaviour than the viscous one, although the underlying properties are not trivial. Several studies about the mathematical properties can be found, but are usually far from the most daily applications. Thus, this paper studies the properties of structural systems whose damping is represented by a fractional model from the point of view of a mechanical engineer. First, a single-degree-of-freedom system with fractional damping is analysed. Specifically, the distribution of the poles and the dynamic response to several excitations is studied for different model parameter values highlighting dissimilarities from systems with conventional viscous damping. In fact, thanks to fractional models, particular behaviours are observed that cannot be reproduced by classical ones. Finally, the dynamics of a machine shaft supported by two bearings presenting fractional damping is analysed. The study is carried out by the Finite Element method, deriving in a system with symmetric matrices. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are obtained by means of an iterative method, and the effect of damping is visualised on the mode shapes. In addition, the response to a perturbation is computed, revealing the influence of the model parameters on the resulting vibration.",60006565,Universidad de Deusto,Bilbao,Spain,['1701'],19.7,0.08928571428571429,0.367989417989418,1

We succeeded in establishing an innovative preparation procedure to reproducibly obtain powder pellet samples with an ideal Lambertian scattering behavior. As a result, a procedure based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was developed that allows for (i) performing reproducible and artifact-free, high-quality measurements as well as (ii) a thorough optical analysis using Monte Carlo and Mie scattering simulations yielding the absorption spectrum in the visible spectral range. The procedure is valid for the particular case of powders that can be compressed into thick, non-translucent pellets and neither requires embedding of the dielectric (nano-)powders within an appropriate host matrix for measurements nor the use of integrating spheres. The reduced spectroscopic procedure minimizes the large number of sources for errors, enables an in-depth understanding of non-avoidable artifacts and is of particular advantage in the field of material sciences, i.e., for getting first insights to the optical features of a newly synthesized, pure dielectric powder, but also as an inline inspection tool for massively parallelised material characterization.",60009731,Universität Osnabrück,Osnabruck,Germany,['1706'],40.4,0.2708369408369408,0.5772077922077922,0

1104,1104,A new version of the item count technique for asking sensitive questions: Testing the performance of the person count technique,"This paper presents empirical evidence on a recent advancement of the item count technique (ICT, a survey technique for asking sensitive questions), namely, the person count technique (PCT; Grant, Moon, & Gleason, 2014). PCT utilizes person lists instead of lists of filler questions, as is the case in the classic ICT design. This simplifies the questioning procedure, but leads to some methodological challenges such as floor and ceiling effects. The main part of this paper presents empirical evidence stemming from an experimental postal survey in Germany (N = 580) investigating how well PCT performs as compared to standard direct questioning (DQ) with regard to alleviating misreporting for questions on attitudes towards refugees. PCT prevalence estimates for hostile attitudes towards refugees are significantly higher than DQ estimates for one item, and non-significantly higher for three items. Although not consistently significant, the differences are substantial, amounting to a threefold increase of the proportion of respondents expressing negative attitudes towards refugees. Even though the findings are not unequivocally in favor of PCT, this new ICT variant still deserves consideration in the future and warrants further development.

1105,1105,Multi-aspect embedding for attribute-aware trajectories,"Motivated by the proliferation of trajectory data produced by advanced GPS-enabled devices, trajectory is gaining in complexity and beginning to embroil additional attributes beyond simply the coordinates. As a consequence, this creates the potential to define the similarity between two attribute-aware trajectories. However, most existing trajectory similarity approaches focus only on location based proximities and fail to capture the semantic similarities encompassed by these additional asymmetric attributes (aspects) of trajectories. In this paper, we propose multi-aspect embedding for attribute-aware trajectories (MAEAT), a representation learning approach for trajectories that simultaneously models the similarities according to their multiple aspects. MAEAT is built upon a sentence embedding algorithm and directly learns whole trajectory embedding via predicting the context aspect tokens when given a trajectory. Two kinds of token generation methods are proposed to extract multiple aspects from the raw trajectories, and a regularization is devised to control the importance among aspects. Extensive experiments on the benchmark and real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed MAEAT compared to the state-of-the-art and baseline methods. The results of MAEAT can well support representative downstream trajectory mining and management tasks, and the algorithm outperforms other compared methods in execution time by at least two orders of magnitude.",60030904,Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1701'],25.375,0.003159340659340656,0.43764390371533235,1

1107,1107,Chasing hard-to-get cases in panel surveys: Is it worth it?," This article examines whether this effort is justified within a panel survey setting. It considers three questions: (i) are hard-to-get cases that are interviewed different from other interviewed cases? (ii) do cases that require a lot of effort in one survey wave require a lot of effort in all waves? and (iii) can easy-to-get cases be re-weighted to eliminate biases arising from not interviewing hard-to-get cases? Using data from a large nationally representative household panel survey, we find that hard-to-get cases are distinctly different from easy-to-get cases, suggesting that failure to obtain interviews with them would likely introduce biases into the sample. Further, being hard-to-get is mostly not a persistent state, meaning these high cost cases are not high cost every year. Simulations confirm that removing hard-to-get cases introduces biases, and these biases lead to an understatement of the extent of change experienced by the population. However, we also find that under one of five fieldwork curtailment strategies considered, the bias in population estimates that would arise if the hard-to-get cases were not pursued can be corrected by applying weights. Nevertheless, this conclusion only applies to the curtailment strategy involving the smallest decline in sample size. Biases associated with curtailment strategies involving larger sample size reductions, and hence greatest cost savings, are not so easily corrected.",60119186,Melbourne Institute,Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],31.0,0.08740896358543418,0.6774649859943978,0

Our algorithm features bilateral filtering as a replacement for the Gaussian function used in the original Retinex algorithm. Operation of the technique is as follows. To begin, we deduced the mathematical model for an improved bilateral filtering function based on the spatial domain kernel function and the pixel difference parameter. The input RGB image was subsequently converted into the Hue Saturation Intensity (HSI) color space, where the reflection component of the intensity channel was extracted to obtain an image whose edges were retained and are not affected by changes in brightness. Following reconversion to the RGB color space, color images of this reflection component were obtained at different resolutions using Gaussian pyramid down-sampling. Each of these images was then processed using the improved Retinex algorithm to improve the contrast of the final image, which was reconstructed using the Laplace algorithm. Results from experiments show that the proposed algorithm can enhance image contrast effectively, and the color of the processed image is in line with what would be perceived by a human observer.",60088077,Putian University,Putian,China,['1703'],25.25,0.121875,0.425,0

1115,1115,A pareto-based hybrid whale optimization algorithm with tabu search for multi-objective optimization,"Multi-Objective Problems (MOPs) are common real-life problems that can be found in different fields, such as bioinformatics and scheduling. Pareto Optimization (PO) is a popular method for solving MOPs, which optimizes all objectives simultaneously. It provides an effective way to evaluate the quality of multi-objective solutions. Swarm Intelligence (SI) methods are population-based methods that generate multiple solutions to the problem, providing SI methods suitable for MOP solutions. SI methods have certain drawbacks when applied to MOPs, such as swarm leader selection and obtaining evenly distributed solutions over solution space. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a recent SI method. In this paper, we propose combining WOA with Tabu Search (TS) for MOPs (MOWOATS). MOWOATS uses TS to store non-dominated solutions in elite lists to guide swarm members, which overcomes the swarm leader selection problem. MOWOATS employs crossover in both intensification and diversification phases to improve diversity of the population.

1118,1118,Adaptive Proxy-Based Controller of an Active Ankle Foot Orthosis to Assist Lower Limb Movements of Paretic Patients,"This paper deals with the control of an active ankle foot orthosis (AAFO) for paretic patients. State of the art methods using an AAFO try to track a predefined trajectory of the ankle joint while guaranteeing the wearer's safety in the presence of a large tracking error. Combining the wearer's safety and tracking accuracy is generally difficult to achieve at the same time, hence a trade-off should be found. Proxy-based sliding mode control (PSMC) offers great performances in both position tracking and safety guarantee. However, its tracking performance is subject to the influences of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances that generally occur during walking. This paper introduces an adaptation interaction method to the basic PSMC with an online adaptation of the proportional, integral and derivative parameters. At the same time, a gait phase-based ankle reference generation algorithm was proposed to adjust the joint reference trajectory in real time. The experiments using the AAFO show better tracking results with respect to basic PSMC while guaranteeing the safety.",60025066,Université Paris-Est Créteil,Creteil,France,"['1712', '1706']",20.75,0.07602040816326532,0.35799319727891155,1
1119,1119,Information processing and overload in group conversation: A graph-based prediction model," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Based on analyzing verbal and nonverbal features of small group conversations in a task-based scenario, this work focuses on automatic detection of group member perceptions about how well they are making use of available information, and whether they are experiencing information overload. Both the verbal and nonverbal features are derived from graph-based social network representations of the group interaction. For the task of predicting the information use ratings, a predictive model using random forests with verbal and nonverbal features significantly outperforms baselines in which the mean or median values of the training data are predicted, as well as significantly outperforming a linear regression baseline. For the task of predicting information overload ratings, the multimodal random forests model again outperforms all other models, including significant improvement over linear regression and gradient boosting models. However, on that task the best model is not significantly better than the mean and median baselines. For both tasks, we analyze performance using the full multimodal feature set versus using only linguistic features or only turn-taking features. While utilizing the full feature set yields the best performance in terms of mean squared error (MSE), there are no statistically significant differences, and using only linguistic features gives comparable performance. We provide a detailed analysis of the individual features that are most useful for each task. Beyond the immediate prediction tasks, our more general goal is to represent conversational interaction in such a way that yields a small number of features capturing the group interaction in an easily interpretable manner. The proposed approach is relevant to many other group prediction tasks as well, and is distinct from both classical natural language processing (NLP) as well as more current deep learning/artificial neural network approaches.",60103055,University of the Fraser Valley,Abbotsford,Canada,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",28.8,0.14339430894308944,0.5210365853658535,0

This technique offers a real scientific opportunity to generate three-dimensional optical components. The chalcogenide glasses are of great interest since they possess a transparency window from the visible up to the midinfrared range. Moreover, they also have high optical non-linearity and high photosensitivity that facilitate the inscription of permanent refractive index modification. In this presentation, an original method based on both the filamentation phenomenon and a point-by-point technique will be described. The written waveguide is of multicore type and consists in parallel channels of positive ▵n placed parallel to each other on a hexagonal or a circular mesh. The performances in terms of optical losses at both 1.55 μm and 4.55 μm measured in such photowritten buried infrared waveguide are very competitive. This writing technique is particularly suitable for the design of single mode waveguide for wavelengths ranging from the visible up to the mid-infrared since the geometry of the inscription and the amplitude of the refractive index modification can be easily adapted.

In this study, we designed a wearable interface to render the location of specific targets with private and non-intrusive tactile cues. Three experimental studies were completed to design and evaluate the tactile code and the device. In the first study, four different tactile codes (single stimuli or trains of pulses rendered either in a Cartesian or a Polar coordinate system) were evaluated with a head pointing task. In the following studies, the most efficient code, trains of pulses with Cartesian coordinates, was used on a bracelet located on the wrist, and evaluated during a visual search task in a complex virtual environment. The second study included ten subjects with a simulated restrictive field of view (10◦). The last study consisted of proof of a concept with one visually impaired subject with restricted peripheral vision due to glaucoma. The results show that the device significantly improved the visual search efficiency with a factor of three.

1125,1125,NIR performance comparison of Bi/Er and Yb/Er co-doped fibres as pumped at 808 nm and 830 nm," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.State-of-The-Art optical fiber communication system reaches to transmission capacity from tens to hundreds of Tb/s. The massive capacity crunch has sparked concerns regarding available bandwidth and constantly increasing optical data traffic. Certainly, one way is to broaden the spectral transmission range beyond the narrow gain band of current erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). Either side of Erbium across low-loss transmission window (1.5μm) shown promising results with optical fibres codoped with rare-earth-doped materials such as bismuth/thulium. Hence, it is of crucial importance to develop broadband optical amplifier to fully utilize the uncovered spectral regions with proper choice of pump wavelength(s)/Laser diodes. Here we have compared the performances of Bismuth/Erbium and Ytterbium/Erbium co-doped fibres as pumped to 808nm to one as pumped at 830nm. The pumping excitation conditions and spectral characteristics in BEDF and EYDF are explored to maximize the lasing efficiency. Using equivalent conditions and same section of Bi/Er codoped fiber, an enhanced broadband emission with FWHM ∼ 149 nm is observed in Bi active centers (BAC) related to Si around ∼1420nm under 808nm excitation as compared to 830nm with its FWHM ∼ 125nm at an input power of ∼ 55.5 mW. At maximum power, under 808nm pumping, a well-known peak emission of Er3+ at 1536nm noticeably increased due to reabsorption of BAC-Si (∼1420nn) with the ratio ∼ 1.7 between Er3+ and BAC-Si emission peaks. On the contrary, emission peak of the BAC-Si revealed higher with the ratio of ∼ 1.5 than that of Er3+ by 830nm pumping. Afterward, we observed Yb3+ emission at 1040nm and 980 nm using Yb/Er codoped fiber with both pumps at same power. Using 808nm pumping, an extended emission band around ∼ 1230 nm appeared namely BAC-Al while the other emission bands associated with BAC-Si (∼ 1480nm) and Er3+ (∼1536nm) shown similar emission bands with high emission peaks compared to 830nm pump at equivalent pump powers. Furthermore, the emission peak of the BAC-Si is about the same level as that of Er3+ with ratio of RBi/Er∼ 1.1 under 808nm pumping while 830 nm pump showed the ∼ 5.25 ratio between the emission peaks of BAC-Si and Er3+. We believe that this side-by-side comparison of two pumps and two home-made fabricated codoped fibres could be useful as a promising strategy for the next-generation WDM passive optical networks employing single broadband amplifier and tunable fiber laser covering 1000-1800nm telecommunication bands.",60028333,University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia,Sydney,Australia,['1706'],28.714285714285715,0.042780952380952385,0.4213619047619047,0
1126,1126,A granularity-based intelligent tutoring system for zooarchaeology," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper presents a tutoring system which uses three different granularities for helping students to classify animals from bone fragments in zooarchaeology. The 3406 bone remains, which have 64 attributes, were obtained from the excavation of the Middle Palaeolithic site of El Salt (Alicante, Spain). The coarse granularity performs a five-class prediction, the medium a twelve-class prediction, and the fine a fifteen-class prediction. In the coarse granularity, the results show that the first 10 most relevant attributes for classification are width, bone, thickness, length, bone fragment, anatomical group, long bone circumference, X, Y, and Z. Based on those results, a user-friendly interface of the tutor has been built in order to train archaeology students to classify new remains using the coarse granularity. A pilot has been performed in the 2019 excavation season in Abric del Pastor (Alicante, Spain), where the automatic tutoring system was used by students to classify 51 new remains. The pilot experience demonstrated the usefulness of the tutoring system both for students when facing their first classification activities and also for seniors since the tutoring system gives them valuable clues for helping in difficult classification problems.",60108713,"Eurecat, Technology Centre of Catalonia",Barcelona,Spain,['1706'],27.571428571428573,0.10995670995670996,0.4982683982683982,0

1128,1128,Implementation of artificial intelligence for classification of frogs in bioacoustics,"This research presents the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) for classification of frogs in symmetry of the bioacoustics spectral by using the feedforward neural network approach (FNNA) and support vector machine (SVM). Recently, the symmetry concept has been applied in physics, and in mathematics to help make mathematical models tractable to achieve the best learning performance. Owing to the symmetry of the bioacoustics spectral, feature extraction can be achieved by integrating the techniques of Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and mentioned machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, neural network, and so on. At the beginning, the raw data information for our experiment is taken from a website which collects many kinds of frog sounds. This in fact saves us collecting the raw data by using a digital signal processing technique. The generally proposed system detects bioacoustic features by using the microphone sensor to record the sounds of different frogs. The data acquisition system uses an embedded controller and a dynamic signal module for making high-accuracy measurements. With regard to bioacoustic features, they are filtered through the MFCC algorithm. As the filtering process is finished, all values from ceptrum signals are collected to form the datasets. For classification and identification of frogs, we adopt the multi-layer FNNA algorithm in machine learning and the results are compared with those obtained by the SVM method at the same time. Additionally, two optimizer functions in neural network include: scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) and gradient descent adaptive learning rate (GDA). Both optimization methods are used to evaluate the classification results from the feature datasets in model training. Also, calculation results from the general central processing unit (CPU) and Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) processors are evaluated and discussed. The effectiveness of the experimental system on the filtered feature datasets is classified by using the FNNA and the SVM scheme.

So far, studies have focused on tuning the IR plasmonic properties for the realization of functional devices, ranging from biosensors to smart windows. However, the utilization of the transparency band where the permittivity approaches zero still remains largely unexplored. Here, we show preliminary results which indicates an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) behavior at optical frequencies of NaxWO3 which arises from the minimization of the total scattering cross-section. Additionally, as a proof of concept, we explore this material for sensing applications and we establish a performant optical sensor with sensitivity of 150 nm/RIU and showing a threefold enhancement with respect to traditional Au nanospheres. The peculiar sensing mechanism is investigated both experimentally and theoretically by means of electrodynamic and first principle calculations.

In particular, we examined a quantum field theoretical propagator which was derived from string theory when compactified at the T-duality self-dual radius and which is closely related to the path integral duality. Our focus was on the hydrogen ground state energy and the 1S1/2-2S1/2 transition frequency, as they are the most precisely explored properties of the hydrogen atom.

The fan-out type is the fastest growing advanced packaging platform. Re-Distribution Layers (RDL) are mainly structures in which the wafer lines are redistributed. In the process of RDL the residual film thickness in nanometers after Chemical-Mechanical Planarization (CMP) step and the depth of RDL structure are mainly the parameters should be measured to ensure the yield rate. In this research, we demonstrate an optical system design of microscope type spectral reflectometry which is based on finite microscope system with reflective objective. The advantage of finite microscope system is less optical components, which leads to less UV and NIR attenuation for the purpose of thin film (∼5 nm) and thick film (∼100 μm) measurement. Adjustable illumination angle design is also included. The illumination light incident on the sample are designed as parallel as possible for increasing the reflective light rays from bottom of RDL. The spot size of measurement area is ∼13 μm in diameter. Meanwhile, the corresponding algorithm including thin film interference model fitting and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for high density RDL analysis are presented.

1138,1138,Supersymmetric NJL-type model for a real superfield composite,"The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is a classic theory for the strong dynamics of composite fields and symmetry breaking. Supersymmetric versions of the NJL-type models are certainly of interest too. Particularly, the case with a composite (Higgs) chiral superfield formed by two (quark) chiral superfields has received much attention. Here, we propose a prototype model with a four-chiral-superfield interaction, giving a real superfield composite. It has a spin-one composite vector field with properties being somewhat similar to a massive gauge boson of spontaneously broken gauge symmetry. As such, it is like the first supersymmetric analog to non-supersymmetric models with spin-one composites. The key formulation developed here is the picture of quantum effective action as a superfield functional with parameters like constant superfields, having explicit supersymmetric and Grassmann number dependent supersymmetry breaking parts. Following the standard non-perturbative analysis for NJL-type models, the gap equation analysis shows plausible signature of dynamical supersymmetry breaking which is worth more serious analysis. With an extra superfield model Lagrangian included, comparison between the models and their non-supersymmetric counterparts is discussed, illustrating the notion of supersymmetrization is nontrivial in the setting.",60024666,National Central University Taiwan,Chung-Li,Taiwan,['1701'],20.333333333333332,0.1303312629399586,0.41035196687370584,1
1139,1139,Embodied engagement with narrative: A design framework for presenting cultural heritage artifacts," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.An increasing number of museum exhibits incorporate multi-modal technologies and interactions; yet these media divert visitors’ attention away from the cultural heritage artifacts on display. This paper proposes an overarching conceptual structure for designing tangible and embodied narrative interaction with cultural heritage artifacts within a museum exhibit so that visitors can interact with them to comprehend their cultural context. The Tangible and Embodied Narrative Framework (TENF) consists of three spectra (diegetic vs. non-diegetic, internal vs. external, and ontological vs. exploratory) and, considering how different interactions map along these three spectra, can guide designers in the way they integrate digital media, narrative, and embodiment. In this paper, we examine interactive narrative scholarship, existing frameworks for tangible and embodied interactions, and tangible and embodied narrative projects. We then describe the design of the TENF and its application to the pilot project, Mapping Place, and to the case study project, Multi-Sensory Prayer Nuts. The findings indicate that embodied engagement with artifacts through a narrative role can help visitors (1) contextualize the meaning of artifacts and (2) make personalized connections to the artifacts. Based on this work, we suggest design recommendations for tailoring the use of the TENF in the cultural heritage domain: simulate cultural practices, associate visitors with cultural perspectives, and provide simultaneous digital feedback. We conclude by describing future directions for the research, which include generating other possible projects using the TENF; collaborating with other designers and museum professionals; and exploring applications of the TENF in museum spaces.",60030838,Ryerson University,Toronto,Canada,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",22.727272727272727,0.02333333333333333,0.2116666666666667,0

1141,1141,Time reversal of optical waves," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.Wave propagation is a linear process in the time domain in the absence of loss. This property has been exploited over the past 20 years for wave control through highly disordered media. Let's consider a short pulse propagating through a disordered system. If the field associated to the pulse is recorded and played backwards, the wave is focused back to the source at a single delay. This time reversal control has been evidenced for low frequency waves such as acoustics, water waves and microwaves. Over the last decade, partial spatiotemporal control of optical waves has been demonstrated by means of spatial light modulators. However full optical time reversal remains elusive. In this paper, we demonstrate time reversal of optical waves with a device that can manipulate independently amplitude and phase of 90 spatial and polarization modes, over 4 THz of bandwidth and 20 ps of delay. For the first time we demonstrate arbitrary control of all the degrees of freedom: spatial (amplitude and phase), polarization, spectral and temporal after propagation through a multimode fiber. This new ability to control and manipulate at will optical waves opens promising opportunities for linear and nonlinear optical phenomena, such as imaging and optical communications.",60031004,University of Queensland,Brisbane,Australia,['1706'],21.0,0.05065447710184553,0.3438858509911141,0

1154,1154,Sovereign and private money in the modern money and credit system,". All rights reserved.The purpose: The purpose of the article is to identify the causes and consequences of parallel (hybrid) circulation of public (sovereign) and private money in national economic systems. The sovereign money is created as a result of credit operations and transactions on repurchasing assets (bonds) carried out by central banks. This money is in operation in payment systems of central banks. The private money is created during credit operations of commercial banks and credited to their clients’ accounts. The parallel circulation of sovereign and private money results from the development of the money and credit system that ensures, firstly, credit activities, and, secondly, settlements between business entities. The results: The result of study include identifying the specifics and areas of developing the parallel (hybrid) circulation of sovereign and private money substantiated by institutional changes in modern monetary systems, in particular, the emergence of payment systems of central banks and the introduction of Basel standards for the activities of commercial banks. Such changes resulted from the development of money and credit relations in the digital economy that predetermined the acceleration of monetary settlements between business entities. In the modern economy, changes in the ratio of sovereign and private money volumes can have impact on the formation of interest and exchange rates. Main conclusions: The division of money supply formed in the modern economy into sovereign and private money has caused, firstly, the increase in the specialization of monetary system institutions form money supply, and, secondly, has concentrated interbank settlements in the payment system of the central bank in order to ensure stability and guaranteed payments. The current trend in the development of sovereign and private money is to strengthen its integration and interdependence resulting in the intensification of their flows and the correlation of the interest rates set by central banks and the interest rates formed in the interbank lending market, as well as the increasing influence of sovereign and private money supply on the dynamics of foreign exchange rates. The subject: The subject of the work is a hybrid circulation of public and private money. In the modern money and credit system, there is an active interaction between the sovereign money of the central bank and the private money of commercial banks. The determination of the characteristics of the money and credit policy in the context of hybrid circulation of sovereign and private money is a necessary condition for this policy efficiency. The hybrid circulation of sovereign and private money considerably complicates the achievement of the following traditional objectives of the money and credit policy: To form money supply, to ensure the balance between demand for money and money supply, and to maintain interest rates that are adequate to profitability in the real sector, as well as the stability of the exchange rate.",60032982,Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation,Moscow,Russian Federation,['1700'],31.066666666666666,0.0375,0.2818333333333333,1
1155,1155,High-resolution molecular spectroscopy and biological applications," Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.The rapid measurement of gas concentrations is beneficial to a broad range of applications, including pollution monitoring, high-precision spectroscopy, and medical breath analysis. Optical frequency combs (OFCs) are a near-ideal optical interrogation source for molecular spectroscopy, combining broadband light with high frequency-precision and dense spectral sampling, characteristics which also allow short measurement times. A spectrometer based on a virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) is used to unravel the comb into a high-resolution transmission spectrum, with the returned spectra rapidly fitted with a detailed spectral model for concentration extraction of CO2. We demonstrate an accuracy of 0.5% and 12% for concentration measurements of 12C16O2 and 13C16O2 respectively, with the measured isotopic ratio in excellent agreement with that expected from their natural abundances. Precision of the concentration measurements is also high, at 0.03% and 1.24% for 12C16O2 and 13C16O2 respectively. The measurement technique is also verified to be highly linear for concentrations ranging over three orders of magnitude. The spatial and temporal coherence of OFCs additionally enables the use of the full range of performance-enhancing optical techniques including resonant enhancement. Here we demonstrate the use of a multi-pass Herriott cell to enhance the effective measurement path length, which allows the continuous optical measurement of CO2 production during the respiration of baker's yeast in a closed system.

The fibre was fabricated using lead-silicate glass and the rod-intube fibre drawing technique. The thin glass rod of ∼1 mm diameter was first coated with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centreenriched diamond particles of ∼1 μm diameter, and subsequently inserted into the glass outer tube. This rod-in-Tube assembly was drawn down to fibre, with the diamond particles distributed at the fused interface between rod and tube. We experimentally coupled 532 nm continuous-wave laser into a 30-cm-length fibre piece from the fibre endface, and examined the photoluminescence (PL) properties of the fibre from both the side of the fibre and the output end of the fibre. PL mapping results showed that the glass-embedded NV emitters showed bright and photostable fluorescence, demonstrating characteristic NV centre zero phonon line emission. Moreover, the mapping result obtained at the output end of fibre indicated that the transmitted NV fluorescence was coupled into the propagation modes of the fibre. By using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from the NV ensemble along the fibre, we demonstrate detection of local magnetic fields via longitudinal excitation and side collection.

These fibers conceived as embedded beams on the surface are allowed to be deformed in a three-dimensional space and are endowed with resistance to stretching, shearing, bending, and twisting. A finite element analysis directly derived from a variational formulation was performed for some explanatory tests to illustrate the behavior of the newly introduced material. Specifically, we considered tests on: (1) bias extension; (2) compressive; (3) shear; and (4) torsion. The numerical results are discussed to some extent.

In this paper, we propose a superpixel-wise fuzzy clustering technique modified by edges, followed by level set evolution (SFCME-LSE), for automatic border extraction in 40 MHz IVUS images. The contributions are three-fold. First, the usage of superpixels suppresses the influence of speckle noise in ultrasound images on the clustering results. Second, we propose a region of interest (ROI) assignment scheme to prevent the segmentation from being distracted by pathological structures and artifacts. Finally, the contour is converged towards the target boundary through LSE with an appropriately improved edge indicator. Quantitative evaluations on two IVUS datasets by the Jaccard measure (JM), the percentage of area difference (PAD), and the Hausdorff distance (HD) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SFCME-LSE method. SFCME-LSE achieves the minimal HD of 1.20 ± 0.66 mm and 1.18 ± 0.70 mm for the MAB and LIB, respectively, among several state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available dataset.",60009860,Fudan University,Shanghai,China,['1706'],22.5,0.17099999999999999,0.44733333333333336,0

The Nordic walking (NW) training may contribute to reducing the asymmetry in upper and lower limb movements in people with PD. We compared the effects of 11 weeks of NW aerobic training on asymmetrical variables of gait in subjects with mild PD. Fourteen subjects with idiopathic PD, age: 66.8 ± 9.6 years, and Hoehn and Yard stage of 1.5 points were enrolled. The kinematic analysis was performed pre and post-intervention. Data were collected at two randomized walking speeds (0.28 m-s-1 and 0.83 m-s-1) during five minutes on the treadmill without poles. The more affected and less affected body side symmetries (threshold at 5% between sides) of angular kinematics and spatiotemporal gait parameters were calculated. We used Generalized Estimating Equations with Bonferroni post hoc (α = 0.05). Maximal flexion of the knee (p = 0.007) and maximal abduction of the hip (p = 0.041) were asymmetrical pre and became symmetrical post NW intervention. The differences occurred in the knee was less affected and the hip was more affected.

However, like other information processing entities, organisations are subject to the limitations of information evolution. These limitations are caused by the combinatorial challenges associated with information processing, and by the trade-offs and shortcuts driven by selection pressures. This paper applies the principles of information evolution to organisations and uses them to derive principles about organisation design and organisation change. This analysis shows that information evolution can illuminate some of the seemingly intractable difficulties of organisations, including the effects of organisational silos and the difficulty of organisational change. The derived principles align with and connect different strands of current organisational thinking.

1174,1174,Tuning the properties of flash-reduced graphene oxide electrodes for supercapacitor applications,"Graphene-based porous materials have attracted broad attentions in supercapacitor (SC) applications, due to the high conductivity and large surface area. The most widely used approach to fabricate graphene-based porous electrode materials is the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The reduction process significantly affects the properties of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), including the conductivity, surface chemistry and the porosity. Therefore, the control the reduction process is of great importance to produce high performance electrode materials. In this paper, we explore the control of the electrical conductivity and surface chemistry of flash reduced GO material, which depends on the reduction degree. The reduction degree is tuned by varying the energy of a camera flash used to reduce the GO. The reduction degree is characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We find the high reduction degree (low oxygen content) is beneficial to achieve high electrical conductivity, however, the overall specific capacitance becomes lower. As a result, we can see that electrode surface chemistry is more dominant than its electrical conductivity in enhancing SC specific capacitance.",60031630,Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus,Kuching,Malaysia,['1706'],19.11111111111111,0.17917410714285717,0.42819196428571427,1

We measured FA (one dimensional and one meristic traits) in the recognized bioindicators-ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae). Beetles were sampled in a vast area (four provinces of Russia with the spectrum of the studied sites, which differed in anthropogenic impact, vegetation, and landscape features). On the basis of such measurements (4673 specimen) we created a data base. Subsequent ANOVA showed, that FA was species-specific (out of six species investigated it was expressed in five ones), sex-biased (males had higher levels of FA), and were affected practically by all environmental factors. Besides significant species-sex and factors-sex interactions were found. So, when employing FA as an indicator of stress, overall biological and ecological variation in species-indicator must be investigated before.

1176,1176,A new approach for grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system sizing considering harmonic contents of smart home appliances," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Even renewable energy sources provide several advantages, especially from an environmental point of view, where the world has faced great challenges in the last few decades; several negative issues also exist regarding the integration of renewable resources-based power production units in electric power systems. One of the main problems related to pivotal renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, etc., is their stochastic and uncontrollable nature in terms of power production. Therefore, this stochasticity in the supply side of the power system may pose many challenges for system operators. This issue is also problematic for smaller applications where the stochastic production by a main resource, such as a roof-top photovoltaic system, and load demand may not match perfectly at each time instant and therefore should be compensated by additional resources such as battery-based energy storage systems. Herein, the economic considerations to ensure minimum costs for such a hybrid system design are vital so as to increase the penetration of such systems. Therefore, the optimal sizing and planning of hybrid systems have recently gained increasing importance to enhance power system operation in the context of the smart grid paradigm. From a different perspective, harmonics are one of the most important power quality problems in system operations caused by widespread integration of power electronic loads with non-linear characteristics that should be considered. Thus, a new approach for grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system sizing is provided. In order to determine optimal capacities for photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) units for covering residential consumer demand, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based formulation is presented. The main objective is minimizing total costs of the system consisting of investment, capital and maintenance cost functions. A daily power curve is created accurately with real measurements of non-linear loads considering harmonic contents of smart home appliances in Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey. In addition, real radiation and temperature values are used in PV production as well as dynamic pricing schemes for realistic evaluations. Moreover, optimal sizing results are compared for both the harmonic-based power curve and rated power curve in terms of satisfying objective function.",60019963,Yildiz Technical University,Istanbul,Turkey,['1706'],27.153846153846153,0.14360956503813652,0.438260152545867,0

A key limiter in achieving a full integrated on a chip design is the lack of broadband waveguide-based detectors, with no designs or experimental broadband devices having been demonstrated to date. Simulation and analysis conducted in this work has produced for the first time, practical graphene-based waveguide detector designs that can be made with existing and improved MIR waveguide technology. Using Rsoft FemSIM with high resolution graded gridding to accurately capture the effects in single layer graphene; extensive, and time consuming, parametrised simulations have been carried out for different waveguide designs to understand the design space available and optimise the absorption of light in graphene coated chalcogenide waveguides. The accuracy of the optical modelling and the values for the graphene material model were verified by modelling experimentally reported devices in the NIR region to ensure there is a close match to the measured points. Geometry (height, width), wavelength, waveguide type (Channel, Rib), Monolayer, bilayer and multilayer graphene layouts were the core variables investigated as functions of the waveguide core refractive index and top and bottom cladding indices. Fig. 1 give the examples of fully-etched waveguide design. Additionally, different materials as buffer/spacer layers to compress the field or to try and locate the graphene in a higher field region were also trialled. The results were contour graphs of absorption versus width and height for the fundamental mode at 10 different wavelengths with different Top/Bottom cladding index contrasts, from which it is possible to design wideband detectors.",60008950,Australian National University,Canberra,Australia,['1706'],28.8,0.15421768707482994,0.5525850340136055,0

By applying a production method, she found little evidence for the hypothesis that balance is favorable for the aesthetical appreciation of pictures. Instead, she observed that other construction principles competing with balance, such as bilateral symmetry and closeness, were applied. The aim of the present study was to repeat some of Puffer's experiments with modern methods and to examine whether her results are replicable. In two experiments, we also found little to no evidence for balance. Moreover, as in Puffer's study, participants used closeness and bilateral symmetry as principles.

Air floating transportation is one of the key technologies for the cost-effective development of bucket foundation. To predict the dynamic behavior of large-diameter tripod bucket foundation (LDTBF) supported by an air cushion and a water plug inside every bucket in waves, three 1/25-scale physical model tests with different bucket spacing were conducted in waves; detailed prototype foundation models were established using a hydrodynamic software MOSES with a draft of 4.0 m, 4.5 m, and 5.0 m and with a water depth of 10.0 m, 11.25 m, and 12.5 m. The numerical and experimental results are consistent for heaving motion, while exhibiting favorable agreement for pitching motion. The results show that the resonant periods for heaving motion increased with increasing draft and water depth. The maximum amplitude for heaving motion first decreased and then increased with the increase of water depth and spacing between the buckets. The maximum amplitude for pitching motion first decreased and then increased with increasing water depth but decreased with increasing spacing between the buckets. The wider the spacing between the bucket foundations, the larger the heave response amplitude operators (RAOs). Simply improving the pitch RAOs by increasing the spacing between bucket foundations is limited and negatively affects motion performance during the transportation of LDTBF.",60019533,Tianjin University,Tianjin,China,['1706'],25.333333333333332,-0.02008928571428572,0.46726190476190477,0

A biofilm is comprised of cells embedded in an extracellular matrix that holds them close together and keeps the biofilm attached to the colonized surface. This predominant lifestyle and its main regulation pathway, namely quorum-sensing (QS), have been shown to induce specific bioactive metabolites.

To this end, we first propose to learn the boundary as an additional semantic class to enable the network to be aware of the boundary layout.

Furthermore, we propose a boundary-aware feature propagation (BFP) module to harvest and propagate the local features within their regions isolated by the learned boundaries in the UAG-structured image. The proposed BFP is capable of splitting the feature propagation into a set of semantic groups via building strong connections among the same segment region but weak connections between different segment regions.

In this paper we introduce the notion of mapping-based knowledge base (MKB) to formalize the situation where both the extensional and the intensional level of the ontology are determined by suitable mappings to a set of data sources. This allows for making the intensional level of the ontology as dynamic as the extensional level traditionally is. To do so, we resort to the meta-modeling capabilities of higher-order description logics, in particular the description logic Hi(DL-LiteR), which allows seeing concepts and relations as individuals, and vice versa. The challenge in this setting is to design efficient algorithms for answering queries posed to MKBs. Besides the definition of MKBs, our main contribution is to prove that answering instance queries posed to MKBs expressed in Hi(DL-LiteR) can be done efficiently.",60032350,Università degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza,Rome,Italy,['1705'],29.833333333333332,0.10997474747474749,0.47607323232323223,1

In this article, the main options for electrifying a high speed AC railway are reviewed from an electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) perspective. Firstly, the trend of increasing the usage of electrified trains to replace conventional diesel locomotives is pointed out. On this basis, the significance of considering EMC in the railway environment is explained, with a view to preventing the malfunction of the railway system. Secondly, different electrification options are introduced, namely the rail-return, booster-transformer and auto-transformer systems. The benefits and drawbacks of each electrification option are considered based on the interference level to the trackside railway signaling and telecommunication systems. The discussion of each electrification system is verified using electromagnetic simulations. By comparing the different electrification schemes, it is shown that the auto-transformer system has better EMC performance and delivers higher power to the train.",123923115,Eurofins York Ltd,York,United Kingdom,"['1712', '1711', '1705']",17.75,0.16838095238095238,0.48638095238095236,1

1193,1193,Efficient vanishing point detection for driving assistance based on visual saliency map and image segmentation from a vehicle black-box camera,"Techniques for detecting a vanishing point (VP) which estimates the direction of a vehicle by analyzing its relationship with surrounding objects have gained considerable attention recently. VPs can be used to support safe vehicle driving in areas such as for autonomous driving, lane-departure avoidance, distance estimation, and road-area detection, by detecting points in which parallel extension lines of objects are concentrated at a single point in a 3D space. In this paper, we proposed a method of detecting the VP in real time for applications to intelligent safe-driving support systems. In order to support safe driving of autonomous vehicles, it is necessary to drive the vehicle with the VP in center of the road image in order to prevent the vehicle from moving out of the road area while driving. Accordingly, in order to detect the VP in the road image, a method of detecting a point where straight lines intersect in an area where edge directional feature information is concentrated is required. The visual attention model and image segmentation process are applied to quickly identify candidate VPs in the area where the edge directional feature-information is concentrated and the intensity contrast difference is large. In the proposed method, VPs are detected by analyzing the edges, visual-attention regions, linear components using the Hough transform, and image segmentation results in an input image. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed method could be applied to safe-driving support systems.",60104027,Sejong cyber university,Seoul,South Korea,['1701'],29.75,0.1986772486772487,0.4357142857142858,1

All rights reserved.Image restoration is a process of reconstructing the image that not only enhancing information, texture and brightness but also removing the noise for restoring the original image. To obtain the best restored image multiresolution based compressive sensing (CS) methodology was implemented, this enhancing approach has the characteristics of enhances an image at different compressive ratios using iterative procedure and results compared between iterations and performance parameter. PSNR (Peak Signal Noise Ratio) is the observing performance parameter for different ratio levels of the image, RMSE, SSIM are the other factors. Our approach results in strong sparse representation to pursue from patch-based sparse compressive sensing (PSCS). PSCS is an adaptive approach to multiresolution analysis, patch sparsest matching for compressive sensing to remove noise and enhances the image restoration possibility.

1195,1195,Fabry-Perot interferometric fibre optic temperature sensor with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coating, Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.A novel polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coated fiber-optic Fabry-Perot interferometric (FFPI) sensor for temperature measurement is proposed and experimentally validated. The sensor head consists of a PVDF thin film formed by the phase inversion process via immersion precipitation at the freshly cleaved endface of a single mode telecommunications optical fibre. The resin polyvinyl butryl (butvar) was used as a cross-linker to promote good adhesion between the optical fibre glass and PVDF in order to reduce operational coupling loss. Sensor operation is demonstrated by shifts of the FFPI reflection spectra and its performance was analysed through measurement of optical thickness or path difference with temperature variation. Experimental data shows that the thermal expansion effect of the PVDF coating is more dominant than its thermo-optic effect. The proposed sensor exhibits an exponential response over 21 to 160 °C inside a tube furnace with a sensitivity that spans between 1.6 nm/°C and 7.5 nm/°C.,60111859,"Victoria University Melbourne, Institute of Sustainable Industries and Liveable Cities",Melbourne,Australia,['1706'],26.666666666666668,0.15357142857142855,0.4705357142857143,0

This is particularly important when analyzing systems which exhibit strong nonlinear response with multiple emission pathways. In this work, we calculate and analyze in details correlations of light emitted from two such canonical nonlinear optical systems, one incorporating Kerr nonlinear medium, and another exhibiting optomechanical coupling between light and quantized motion of a generic mechanical oscillator. We compare their single-and two-photon emission characteristics by employing a recently developed framework that allows us to calculate the frequency-resolved g(2) correlations between emitted photons with two arbitrary frequencies. Our analysis shows a rich landscape of bunching and antibunching associated with multi-photon emission events, and reveals the distinctive temporal characteristics of such processes. This new understanding provides a new asset to characterize and exploit nonlinear phenomena in Kerr and optomechanical systems in future experiments.",60103735,CSIC UPV Centro de Fisica de Materials CFM,Donostia-San Sebastian,Spain,['1706'],28.166666666666668,0.14339225589225588,0.4398569023569023,0

This paradigm is aimed at addressing the loss of important side information which typically occurs during the abstraction process that models real-world problems as computational problems. We use two measures for the diversity of such a collection: the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances, and the minimum pairwise Hamming distance. We show that both problems are fixed-parameter tractable in k + r for both diversity measures. A key ingredient in our algorithms is a (problem independent) network flow formulation that, given a set of 'base' solutions, computes a maximally diverse collection of solutions.

1198,1198,Autonomous Kinetic Invariants of Linear Chemical Reactions,"Abstract: A method has been developed for calculating the exact autonomous kinetic invariants of multistage linear chemical reactions occurring in a gradientless isothermal reactor via any number of elementary stages and involving an arbitrary number of reagents within the framework of mass-action law. These invariants are functions that remain strictly constant throughout the reaction (i.e., are time-independent), although they depend on the nonequilibrium reagent concentrations measured in two experiments with different initial conditions (dual experiments). For the dynamic models of linear reactions, one can always find general and particular analytical solutions expressed explicitly in terms of the initial conditions. The idea of the method is based on choosing the initial conditions that allow the nonequilibrium reagent concentrations to be expressed in terms of constant kinetic parameters (stage rate and flow rate constants). An applicability criterion of the method was formulated. The number of different invariants was shown to be equal to the number of reagents. The relations obtained in this study were used to investigate the relaxation properties of multistage linear reactions occurring in closed and open isothermal systems. The invariant curves found for these reactions were compared with the concentration curves measured in two nonequilibrium experiments throughout the transition process. For these reactions, the time dependences of the invariants remained strictly constant, while the reagent concentrations continuously changed (including nonmonotonously) during the reaction. The results give new insight into the relaxation of linear chemical reactions and can be used to solve the inverse problems of chemical kinetics under the conditions of an isothermal perfect-mixing reactor.",60011928,Chuvash State University,Cheboksary,Russian Federation,['1706'],25.6,0.06015151515151516,0.3627272727272726,1

In this paper, we study the behavior of teleoperators of mobile robotic telepresence systems to determine whether they adhere to spatial formations when navigating to groups. This work uses a simulated environment in which teleoperators are requested to navigate to different groups of virtual agents. The simulated environment represents a conference lobby scenario where multiple groups of Virtual Agents with varying group sizes are placed in different spatial formations. The task requires teleoperators to navigate a robot to join each group using an egocentric-perspective camera. In a second phase, teleoperators are allowed to evaluate their own performance by reviewing how they navigated the robot from an exocentric perspective. The two important outcomes from this study are, firstly, teleoperators inherently respect F-formations even when operating a mobile robotic telepresence system. Secondly, teleoperators prefer additional support in order to correctly navigate the robot into a preferred position that adheres to F-formations.",60008141,Örebro Universitet,Orebro,Sweden,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",21.875,0.11410256410256411,0.4384615384615384,0

Research on the materiality of boardgames has highlighted the inherent material aspects to this analog form of play and how these are relevant for the design of digital play. In this work, we analyze the inherent material qualities and related experiences of boardgames, and speculate how these might shift in remote manifestations. Based on that, we depict three lenses of designing for remote tangible play: physicality, agency, and time. These lenses present leverage points for future designs and illustrate how the digital and the physical can complement each other following alternative notions of hybrid digital–physical play. Based on that, we illustrate the related design space and discuss how boardgame qualities can be translated to the remote space, as well as how their characteristics might change. Thereby, we shed light on related design challenges and reflect on how designing for shared physicality can enrich dislocated play by applying these lenses.",60002963,Universitat Salzburg,Salzburg,Austria,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",23.857142857142858,0.016176470588235296,0.2554621848739496,0

In this paper, reversible marker automata on two-dimensional tapes are defined, and their accepting capability is investigated. It is shown that an irreversible deterministic k-marker automaton is simulated by reversible deterministic one with the same number of markers. Therefore, the constraint of reversibility does not decrease its accepting power. It is also shown that a reversible nondeterministic k-marker automaton is simulated by reversible deterministic one with the same number of markers. Therefore, adding nondeterminism to reversible ones does not increase their accepting power. By above, these three models are equivalent. We give concrete conversion procedures for these two cases.

Researchers have supported that movement-based interaction afforded by emerging embodied digital educational games may heighten even more immersion and learning. However, there is lack of empirical research warranting these claims. This case study has investigated the impact of high-embodied digital educational game, integrated in a primary school classroom, on children’s immersion and content knowledge about nutrition (condition1 = 24 children), in comparison to the impact of a low-embodied version of the game (condition2 = 20 children). Post-interventional surveys investigating immersion indicated that there was difference only on the level of engagement, in terms of perceived usability, while children’s learning gains in terms of content knowledge did not differ among the two conditions. Interviews with a subset of the children (n = 8 per condition) resulted in the identification of (a) media form, (b) media content and (c) context-related factors, which provided plausible explanations about children’s experienced immersion.

Based on the spatial distribution, the physical feature of transient heat conduction and the periodic property of structure, a special feature of temperature responses caused by the moving heat source is illustrated. Then, combined with the superposition principle of linear system, within a small time-step, computation of results corresponding to the whole structure excited by the Gaussian heat source is transformed into that of some small-scale structures. Lastly, the precise integration method (PIM) is used to solve the temperature responses of each small-scale structure efficiently and accurately. Findings: Within a reasonable time-step, the heat source applied on a unit cell can only cause the temperature responses of a limited number of adjacent unit cells. According to the above feature and the periodic property of a structure, the contributions caused by the moving heat source for the most of time-steps are repeatable, and the temperature responses of the entire periodic structure can be obtained by some small-scale structures. Originality/value: A novel numerical method is proposed for analysing moving heat source problems, and the numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method is much more efficient than the traditional methods, even for larger-scale problems and multiple moving heat source problems.",60020661,University of Liverpool,Liverpool,United Kingdom,['1706'],29.5,0.16726190476190475,0.47863756613756614,1

This approach leverages image compression technology that has been developed and proven over many years of R&D, standardization, and wide deployment. In our approach, the X,Y,Z coordinates of lidar scan points are quantized, packed into one or more 2-D images, and subsequently compressed by an image codec. In addition, lidar scan points are re-ordered to optimize spatial prediction and compression efficiency. We have obtained initial results on automotive lidar data scans using several compression engines. Results using PNG and JPEG-LS and using very simple packing techniques show significant compression gains over traditional lidar data coding methods.",60033010,Intel Corporation,Santa Clara,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",20.833333333333332,0.125,0.3535714285714286,0

At all of the three pressures, a three-dimensional surface oxide film with the Rh2O3 stoichiometry was formed on the foil surface starting from a temperature of 150°C. As the interaction temperature was increased at an NO2 pressure of 10–6 mbar, the film thickness d initially increased to reach a maximum of ~2.0 nm at 350°C and then decreased due to the decomposition of Rh2O3 to the metal. At pressures of 10–5 and 10–4 mbar, a monotonic increase in d up to 3.0 or 4.7 nm, respectively, was observed in a temperature range of 150–450°C. In the case of the interaction with the participation of molecular oxygen at a pressure of 10–4 mbar and temperatures of 30–450°C, the Rh foil surface was not oxidized.

1225,1225,Audio legends: Investigating sonic interaction in an augmented reality audio game," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Augmented Reality Audio Games (ARAG) enrich the physical world with virtual sounds to express their content and mechanics. Existing ARAG implementations have focused on exploring the surroundings and navigating to virtual sound sources as the main mode of interaction. This paper suggests that gestural activity with a handheld device can realize complex modes of sonic interaction in the augmented environment, resulting in an enhanced immersive game experience. The ARAG “Audio Legends” was designed and tested to evaluate the usability and immersion of a system featuring an exploration phase based on auditory navigation, as well as an action phase, in which players aim at virtual sonic targets and wave the device to hit them or hold the device to block them. The results of the experiment provide evidence that players are easily accustomed to auditory navigation and that gestural sonic interaction is perceived as difficult, yet this does not affect negatively the system’s usability and players’ immersion. Findings also include indications that elements, such as sound design, the synchronization of sound and gesture, the fidelity of audio augmentation, and environmental conditions, also affect significantly the game experience, whereas background factors, such as age, sex, and game or music experience, do not have any critical impact.",60013925,Ionian Panepistimion,49100 Corfu,Greece,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",34.666666666666664,-0.0014705882352941124,0.4873249299719889,0

In the hydrogenation of acetylene in excess ethylene, PdIn/Al2O3 had significantly higher selectivity of ethylene formation (~86%) than monometallic Pd/Al2O3 (~35%).

1227,1227,Gas evolution and the effects on ionic transport inside the lithium-ion battery,"Purpose: Gas evolution within lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) gives rise to safety concerns that question their applicability. The gas evolution is not only the result but also the inducement of performance deterioration of LIBs. In this paper, the growth characteristics and dynamic behavior of gas bubble on the electrode surface are studied, and the interference mechanism of gas evolution on Li-ion diffusion or Li-ion conduction within LIBs is discussed and validated by the numerical simulations. Design/methodology/approach: First, the mathematical models and simulation method are established. The growth and flow of gas bubble in the serpentine channel on electrode surface, which results from the gas-liquid flow and the effects of surface tension, is modeled by using the multi-phase Navier-Stokes and the volume of fluid method. Integrating Butler–Volmer and Fick’s law, the mathematical model of ions transport in the electrochemical cell is set-up. Second, the motion of gas bubble is tracked, and the variations of bubble shape and characteristic parameters with time are obtained by the computed fluid dynamics (CFD) method. Findings: Based on the CFD results, the battery models and electrochemical simulations are carried out to analyze the ionic transport characteristics. The results show that the microstructural morphology such as the serpentine channel shape and size on electrode surface are important aspects for the gas bubble growth and the local ionic transport. Li ions significantly accumulate at one side of the gas obstacle, hindering the ionic diffusion normally. When the gas bubble blocks the electrolyte, the passage of ions from the positive to the negative is interrupted, and the open circuit zone of the electrochemical cell is formed. Originality/value: The gas evolution within LIBs is not only a result but also an inducement of its performance deterioration. The primary issues in this study are the growth characteristics and dynamic behavior of gas bubble on the electrode surface, providing the knowledge for the interference mechanism of gas evolution on ionic transport and ultimately leads to significant increase of battery resistance.",60025441,Nanjing Tech University,Nanjing,China,"['1712', '1706', '1703']",25.153846153846153,0.08230027548209366,0.4626721763085399,1

1229,1229,Prediction of who will be next speaker and when using mouth-opening pattern in multi-party conversation," Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.We investigated the mouth-opening transition pattern (MOTP), which represents the change of mouth-opening degree during the end of an utterance, and used it to predict the next speaker and utterance interval between the start time of the next speaker’s utterance and the end time of the current speaker’s utterance in a multi-party conversation. We first collected verbal and nonverbal data that include speech and the degree of mouth opening (closed, narrow-open, wide-open) of participants that were manually annotated in four-person conversation. A key finding of the MOTP analysis is that the current speaker often keeps her mouth narrow-open during turn-keeping and starts to close it after opening it narrowly or continues to open it widely during turn-changing. The next speaker often starts to open her mouth narrowly after closing it during turn-changing. Moreover, when the current speaker starts to close her mouth after opening it narrowly in turn-keeping, the utterance interval tends to be short. In contrast, when the current speaker and the listeners open their mouths narrowly after opening them narrowly and then widely, the utterance interval tends to be long. On the basis of these results, we implemented prediction models of the next-speaker and utterance interval using MOTPs. As a multimodal-feature fusion, we also implemented models using eye-gaze behavior, which is one of the most useful items of information for prediction of next-speaker and utterance interval according to our previous study, in addition to MOTPs. The evaluation result of the models suggests that the MOTPs of the current speaker and listeners are effective for predicting the next speaker and utterance interval in multi-party conversation. Our multimodal-feature fusion model using MOTPs and eye-gaze behavior is more useful for predicting the next speaker and utterance interval than using only one or the other.",60025555,Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation,Tokyo,Japan,"['1705', '1706', '1709']",29.7,0.02449494949494949,0.35681818181818187,0

It was shown that the alkali metals decreased the reforming rate, whereas the rate was scarcely influenced by the alkaline earth ones. Carbon deposition was also more markedly retarded by the alkali metals than the alkaline earth ones. It was revealed that one of the essential roles of the basic additives was to reduce the ability of cobalt for methane decomposition through a partial covering of the active sites. Another effect was to modify acid-base properties of the catalyst surface toward higher basicity thus increasing adsorption of acidic CO2. Abundance of adsorbed CO2 on the catalyst should be an unfavorable condition for decomposition of methane and consequently, carbon formation was further suppressed. It was also suggested that carbon gasification rate was not significantly influenced by the additives.",60024621,National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,Tokyo,Japan,['1706'],22.0,-0.08708333333333333,0.5199999999999999,1

The effect of the degree of substitution of La for Sr on the physicochemical (phase composition and textural characteristics) and catalytic properties of oxides in the oxidative condensation of methane at temperatures of 700–800°C were studied. It was found that multiphase Sr2 – xLaxTiO4 samples with the degree of substitution x = 0.8–1.8 were most active and selective in the test reaction; this was likely related to the presence of lanthanum oxide and strontium oxide impurities in them, their optimum distribution over the surface, and the specific surface area.",60026991,Boreskov Institute of Catalysis SB RAS,Novosibirsk,Russian Federation,['1706'],36.333333333333336,0.17777777777777778,0.5875,1

The value of TC can be measured due to the fact that the diffraction spot will appear a bright high intensity when the TC is equal to the diffractive grating spoke number, and otherwise the central intensity remains doughnut-like structure. Meanwhile, the rotated direction of the twist fringes is opposite with the grating, therefore the sign of TC can be distinguished. Moreover, in addition to discussing the light beam illuminates the geometric center of the grating, the beam misalignment condition is also considered. In this case, the magnitude and sign of TC can be simultaneously determined by the number and orientation of the bright spots, respectively. The experimental results indicate that this scheme is robust and effective because the GCPSSG shows good tolerance to environment vibration and beam misalignment for the TC diagnostics, which is anticipated to be useful for optical communication.",60025578,Xidian University,Xi'an,China,['1705'],29.166666666666668,0.23566666666666666,0.4076666666666667,1
1239,1239,Realization of high-intensity focusing ultrasound pressure and detection of sound field,"In the ultrasound field, the parameters of the therapeutic sound field can't trace to the source, or be directly measured. In order to solve this problem, this paper builds a system to obtain high-intensity focusing ultrasound pressure and detect sound field. High-intensity ultrasound pressure is detected directly by laser scanning technology. This technology overcomes the disadvantages of needlelike or thin-film hydrophone, whose tolerance is low, invasive detection influences the ultrasound field, and limited size brings the amendment average effect. Firstly, the general principle to measure the ultrasound pressure is proposed. The optical interference method is adopted to put a thin film coated with gold into the ultrasound field. When the thickness of the thin film is much smaller than the wavelength of the ultrasound, the vibration velocity of the thin film can be obtained by laser vibrometer, then the sound pressure of the same position can be calculated accordingly. Secondly, the configuration of the system is clearly shown, including the hardware and software. The system can realize scanning the ultrasound field, and obtain the characteristics parameters. Finally, the achieved target is introduced. The range of frequency is from 0.5 MHz to 60 MHz with 10 MPa@1 MHz peak-to-peak sound pressure value.

1247,1247,"Shape memory alloy based caudal fin for a robotic fish: Design, fabrication, control and characterization",A bio-mimetic fin embedded with shape memory alloy (SMA) wires has been developed. The design of the bio-mimetic fin is based on the musculature of a cuttlefish fin. The musculature of cuttlefish is studied. SMA is chosen as an actuator among the other smart material for its low actuation voltage and high power to weight ratio. A stepwise fabrication process of a bio-mimetic fin has been described for consistency and better performance. A series of tensile tests have been conducted to optimize the annealing temperature and the required pre-straining of the SMA wire actuating the developed fin. The optimum annealing temperature and the required pre-straining has been found to be 410ºC and 4-6% respectively. The details of the heat treatment process followed have also been described. The maximum bending angle of 60ºhas been obtained for the developed bio-mimetic fin. The developed bio-mimetic fin has been integrated into a fish-inspired robotic structure to validate the capability of the developed biomimetic fin. The developed robotic fish can perform subcarangiform locomotion. The robot is capable of swimming in the forward direction as well as turning swimming mode. A control scheme for forward and turning swimming mode has been described. The developed robot is untethered and controlled wirelessly.

1274,1274,Estimation and closed-loop control of COG/ZMP in biped devices blending CoP measures and kinematic information,"The zero moment point (ZMP) and the linearized inverted pendulum model linking the ZMP to the center of gravity (COG) have an important role in the control of the postural equilibrium (balance) of biped robots and lower-limb exoskeletons. A solution for balance real time control, closing the loop from the joint actual values of the COG and ZMP, has been proposed by Choi. However, this approach cannot be practically implemented: While the ZMP actual value is available from the center of pressure (CoP) measured under the feet soles, the COG is not measurable, but it can only be indirectly assessed from the joint-angle measures, the knowledge of the kinematics, and the usually poorly known weight distribution of the links of the chain. Finally, the possible presence of unknown external disturbance forces and the nonlinear, complex nature of the kinematics perturb the simple relationship between the ZMP and COG in the linearized model. The aim of this paper is to offer, starting from Choi's model, a practical implementation of closed-loop balance control fusing CoP and joint-angle measures, eliminating possible inconsistencies. In order to achieve this result, we introduce a model of the linearized inverted pendulum for an extended estimation, not only of COG and ZMP, but also of external disturbances. This model is then used, instead of Choi's equations, for estimation and balance control, using H∞ theory.

1279,1279,For the affective aesthetics of contemporary music video," All rights reserved.Drawing on the ongoing dialogue between current music video scholarship and a cultural turn to affect, this article argues for an approach to affective aesthetics that focuses on both the aesthetically and theoretically generative work of affects within the music videos' audiovisual forms and their performative mechanisms. Through a close analysis of 'National Anthem' by Lana Del Rey (dir. A. Mandler, 2012) and Baauer's 'Day Ones' (dir. H. Murai, 2016), it examines anachronistic strategies through which contemporary music video performs political history, encompassing both past events and their mediation. While Mandler's video generates nostalgia through the combination of archival media materiality, trip-hop tunes, and the narrative loop, mutually reshaping Kennedy's 1960s and the Obama era, Murai's piece plays out the ironic reenactment that actualises the remote past through the affective perspective of anger enacted by the existential lyrics, dark beats, and anachronistic imagery of violence, merging the American Revolutionary War with suburban hip-hop reality. Opening up past events to the contemporary affects that shape audiovisual forms and trigger a transhistorical experience, both videos compel us to rethink the force of music video affects as neither emotional, nor representational, but rather performative.",60003367,Univerzita Palackého v Olomouci,Olomouc,Czech Republic,['1704'],24.25,-0.06666666666666667,0.25833333333333336,0
1280,1280,"A priori estimates of attraction basins for nonlinear least squares, with application to Helmholtz seismic inverse problem","In this paper, we provide an a priori optimizability analysis of nonlinear least squares problems that are solved by local optimization algorithms. We define attraction (convergence) basins where the misfit functional is guaranteed to have only one local - and hence global - stationary point, provided the data error is below some tolerable error level. We use geometry in the data space (strictly quasiconvex sets) in order to compute the size of the attraction basin (in the parameter space) and the associated tolerable error level (in the data space). These estimates are defined a priori, i.e. they do not involve any least squares minimization problems, and only depend on the forward map. This methodology is applied to the comparison of the optimizability properties of two methods for the seismic inverse problem for a time-harmonic wave equation: the full waveform inversion (FWI) and its migration-based travel time (MBTT) reformulation. Computing the size of the attraction basins for the two approaches allows us to quantify the benefits of the latter, which can alleviate the requirement of low-frequency data for reconstruction of the background velocity model.",60008134,CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,Paris,France,"['1711', '1706']",26.142857142857142,-0.027777777777777776,0.3722222222222222,1
1282,1282,"Technologies, methods, and approaches on detection system of plant pests and diseases"," All rights reserved.This research aims to identify the technology, methods, approaches applied in developing plant pest and disease detection systems. For this purpose, it mainly reviews systematically related research on identification, monitoring, detection, and control techniques of plant pests and diseases using a computer or mobile technology. Evidence from the literature shows previous both academia and practitioners have used various technologies, methods and approaches for developing detection system of plant pests and diseases. Some technologies have been applied for the detection system, such as web-based, mobile-based, and internet of things (IoT). Furthermore, the dominant approaches are expert system and deep learning. While backward chaining, forward chaining, fuzzy model, genetic algorithm (GA), K-means clustering, Bayesian networks and incremental learning, Naïve Bayes and Certainty Factors, Convolutional Neural Network, and Decision Tree are the most frequently methods applied in the previous researches. The review also indicated that no single technology or technique is best for developing accurate pest/disease detection system. Instead, the combination of technologies, methods, and approaches resulted in different performance and accuracies. A possible explanation for this is because the systems are used for detecting, controlling and monitoring various plants, such as corn, onion, wheat, rice, mango, flower, and others that are different. This research contributes by providing a reference for technologies, methods, and approaches to the detection system for plant pests and diseases. Also, it adds a way of literature review. This research has implications for researchers as a reference for researching in the computer system, especially for the detection of plant pest and disease research.

This technology has the advantages of high resolution and high sensibility, and been widely employed in atmosphere environment detection in recent years. This paper mainly introduces how TDLAS is applied to detect the vehicle exhaust, to determine the content of CO, CO2, NO and alkanes etc. Firstly, the principle of TDLAS is Lambert-Beer's law. It is based on the specific spectral ""fingerprint"" characteristics of different gases to detect the gas composition. In the same time, the light intensity is attenuated by molecular absorption, which is used to accurately analyze the density of gas. There are two ways to achieve. One is direct-absorption way, whose configuration and signal processing are simple, results have no need to be demarcated. The other is wavelength-modulation way, which has high resolution and low threshold. The selection of absorption spectral line needs not only to adapt the central wavelength of laser and responding wavelength of detector, but also to avoid the crossed spectral line of different gas to improve the precision of detection. Secondly, TDLAS system includes three parts, which are signal generation, signal detection and signal processing. Finally, TDLAS is compared with other spectral detection technologies in the aspect of sensitivity, character of working, applicable kinds of gas, in order to highlight the application scope of each technology.",60022281,Beijing University of Technology,Beijing,China,['1706'],19.0,0.07030303030303031,0.45350649350649347,1

This ontology build after basic analysis of hand object coordination, can be used for preserving, improving and sharing the captured knowledge. We begin with our description of the required knowledge of a geometrical concept formed during human grasping, to a point where it can be used to plan grasping based on the objects identified. Using tactile and kinesthetic information along with relevant domain concepts, we emphasized on the rationality of designing an ontology for reusability and sustainability of knowledge.

A large threshold value will produce fast converging, but the accuracy value will be low, and vice versa, then the determination of the threshold value will be very dilemma. Therefore, this study proposed a combination of Improved Differential Evolution (IDE) and Jaya optimization based on predictive curves using cubic spline interpolation to determine the best particles after the IDE reaches convergent criteria, so that with a large threshold value it will still get high accuracy and high convergent speed. Furthermore, the algorithm proposed in this study is known as Improved Differential Evolution and Jaya Based Spline (IDESJaya).

In many robotic applications such as in case of spherical robots used for surveillance, the platform on which the camera resides is often unsteady and unwanted relative motion exists between camera and scene. This unwanted relative motion in case of a spherical robot is due to the pitching motion associated with its platform called yoke. A depth estimation algorithm that handles the effect of pitching using non-linear observer approach is proposed. The object in the scene whose depth is to be estimated is detected as features in the acquired images and are tracked by using concepts of optical flow. A discrete time state space model that fuses the information from camera and IMU data attached to the unsteady platform of spherical robot is derived. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used as the non-linear estimation technique for extraction of depth information from the proposed state space model. The convergence aspects of the extended Kalman filter when used as a deterministic observer for the proposed non-linear discrete-time model is analyzed with local observability and it is shown that there is boundedness of error covariance between the observed and actual depth. It is shown that the estimation error converges to zero irrespective of the initialization provided to the observer.",60014153,"Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay",Mumbai,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",25.0,0.034375,0.209375,1

Since, the body undulation takes place in two orthogonal planes simultaneously through the application of sinusoidal Joint Orientation Functions (JOFs), the contact points between the body and surface change rapidly, which makes it more complex to analyze the kinematic behaviour. At this juncture, the applicability of the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model has been evaluated to predict the kinematic behavior (primarily the net displacement) of the robot for a given set of input JOF parameters while performing a certain locomotion.

1316,1316,The discrete Fourier transform for golden angle linogram sampling,"Estimation of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) at points of a finite domain arises in many imaging applications. A new approach to this task, the golden angle linogram Fourier domain (GALFD), is presented, together with a computationally fast and accurate tool, named golden angle linogram evaluation (GALE), for approximating the DTFT at points of a GALFD. A GALFD resembles a linogram Fourier domain (LFD), which is efficient and accurate. A limitation of linograms is that embedding an LFD into a larger one requires many extra points, at least doubling the domain's cardinality. The GALFD, on the other hand, allows for incremental inclusion of relatively few data points. Approximation error bounds and floating point operations counts are presented to show that GALE computes accurately and efficiently the DTFT at the points of a GALFD. The ability to extend the data collection in small increments is beneficial in applications such as magnetic resonance imaging. Experiments for simulated and for real-world data are presented to substantiate the theoretical claims. The mathematical analysis, algorithms, and software developed in the paper are equally suitable to other angular distributions of rays and therefore we bring the benefits of linograms to arbitrary radial patterns.",60021784,New York University,New York,United States,"['1711', '1706']",21.88888888888889,0.12210743801652892,0.4297520661157025,1

The paper presents a machine learning based novel end to end solution to the object manipulation problem. Kinect sensor is placed at the base of the youBot for the sensing operation. This helps in the reconstruction of the environment and thereby makes it possible to stop near the target to be picked. A camera is mounted in eye in hand configuration on the YouBot. To perceive the depth of the target, an initial estimate is taken with a stereo image pair using a single camera, thus eliminating the need of multiple cameras or other sensors for depth estimation. A machine learning approach is then used to determine the grasping point of the object. Path planning plays an important role in the overall problem, therefore an adaptive visual servoing based solution is employed to make the picking solution robust. Parameters for trajectory planning are optimized by minimizing the error between the initial and the desired configuration while respecting the systems constraints. Further to make the algorithm robust, the validation is done on the COIL 100 dataset.

Most of the cognitive radio researchers does not consider the spatial diversity of sensing nodes. However, the mobility of the SNs within PU’s coverage area is heavily influencing the detection performance on local observation of energy signals. The movement of the SNs creates spatial diversity in the observation of the PU’s signal. Due to the movement, spatial distance, velocity, Doppler Effect and geo-location information, the signals condition would fluctuate during the sensing process. Spatial diversity also reduces the average received signal strength and must be compensated by detection signal method which appropriate with the signal conditions. Therefore, it is need to find a comprehensive solution to overcome the effects of spatial diversity. Moreover, this research could give a clearly analysis in spectrum exchange information regarding detection performance for cognitive radio networks.

Patient will need additional surgery to replace the pacemaker unit with the new one. It has been suggested to use rechargeable battery to solve this issue. Recharging a battery within the body, however, is not viable owing to the lifetime of tissue heating and battery charging. For these purposes, the use of piezo-polymer is appropriate as a power harvester for a self-powered pacemaker. Piezo-polymer was commonly used for energy harvesting, but none for implantable cardiothoracic devices. This study focuses on identifying the optimum location on the heart to put the piezo-polymer. This research is conducted by simulation of left ventricle of heart via ANSYS. Heart stress-strain Finite Element Analysis (FEA) are employed to obtain the maximum harvested power. The result shows the location of myocardial contraction that produces sufficient kinetic energy for the placement of the pacemaker. The heart 3-dimensional images are taken from cardiac-CT or cardiac-MRI to search the optimum location on the heart for energy harvesting and minimize pacing energy.

1334,1334,CCNet: Criss-cross attention for semantic segmentation,"Full-image dependencies provide useful contextual information to benefit visual understanding problems. In this work, we propose a Criss-Cross Network (CCNet) for obtaining such contextual information in a more effective and efficient way. Concretely, for each pixel, a novel criss-cross attention module in CCNet harvests the contextual information of all the pixels on its criss-cross path. By taking a further recurrent operation, each pixel can finally capture the full-image dependencies from all pixels. Overall, CCNet is with the following merits: 1) GPU memory friendly. Compared with the non-local block, the proposed recurrent criss-cross attention module requires 11x less GPU memory usage. 2) High computational efficiency. The recurrent criss-cross attention significantly reduces FLOPs by about 85% of the non-local block in computing full-image dependencies. 3) The state-of-the-art performance. We conduct extensive experiments on popular semantic segmentation benchmarks including Cityscapes, ADE20K, and instance segmentation benchmark COCO.

In this paper, we describe the development of a method for a mobile robot to avoid a pedestrian approaching from the front and to pass him/her by while preserving the ""public distance"" of personal space. We assume a robot that moves along a prerecorded path. When the robot detects a pedestrian using a laser range finder (LRF), it calculates the trajectory to avoid the pedestrian considering their personal space, passes by the pedestrian, and returns to the original trajectory. We introduce a virtual target to control the robot moving along the path, such that it can use the same control strategy as for human-following behavior. We carry out experiments to evaluate the method along three routes, in which the robot functioned without problems. The distance between the robot and the pedestrian was 9.3 m, on average, when the robot started to use avoiding behavior, which is large enough to keep a public distance from a pedestrian.

The Mirai botnet case in September 2016 revealed a serious vulnerability in IoT devices. Researchers try to mitigate the issues using several approaches. One of them uses Blockchain for the solution. At first, the integration of the Blockchain on IoT seems promising. However, there are problems in resource consumption and latency. Several solutions emerge to make Blockchain uses low resource consumption i.e., LSB and FogBus. Unfortunately, each solution has its weaknesses. FogBus has a weakness in integrity, whereas LSB has a weakness in its availability when an attack occurs on a broker. We introduce Lightweight Multi-Fog (LMF) Blockchain Model to increase availability in the LSB model. The main idea is increasing the integrity availability by splitting location based on Broadcast Domains while using Fog Computing on each Broadcast Domain. An attack in some Broadcast Domain cannot impact transactions and process in other Broadcast Domain and each Broadcast Domain have its separate transaction and process.

The Truth Tables to Binary Decision Diagrams transformation was written for an early version of ATL roughly 13 years ago. At that time, performance was not as much of a concern as it is today. Not only were execution engines slower than now, but they also did not provide as many optimization opportunities. Consequently, in its original form, this transformation does not scale well to large models. It remains slow, even when using EMFTVM, the state-of-the-art ATL virtual machine.

The visual servoing problem of tracking a known object using data from a monocular camera can be solved with a simple closed loop controller. However, this system frequently fails in situations where the object cannot be detected and to overcome this problem an estimation based tracking system is required. This work employs an Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) to improve the visual feedback of the camera. The role of the AKF is to estimate the position of the object when it is occluded/out of view and remove the noise and uncertainties associated with visual data. Two estimation models for the AKF are selected for comparison and among them, the Mean-Adaptive acceleration model is implemented on a 6-DOF UR5 articulated arm with a monocular camera mounted in eye-in-hand configuration to follow the known object in 2D cartesian space (without using depth information).",60104343,Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur,Jodhpur,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",27.833333333333332,-0.09999999999999999,0.1261904761904762,1

1391,1391,Applying formal reasoning to model transformation: The Meeduse solution," Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4-0 International (CC BY 4.0).The TTC'2019 case study deals with a realistic model transformation which generates binary decision diagrams from truth tables. Among other challenges, the contest emphasizes on correctness which motivated us to apply Meeduse, a tool that we developed in order to define formal semantics with animation facilities of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). This study allowed us to try how far we can push the abilities of a formal method to be integrated within model-driven engineering. The results were positive, and show that Meeduse can be adapted to model transformation which brings to this field formal automated reasoning tools like AtelierB for theorem proving and ProB for model-checking. Meeduse, combined with ProB, provides three strategies: random animation, interactive animation and model-checking. The first strategy runs randomly the transformation rules until it consumes all the truth table rows and then automatically produces the binary decision diagram. The second strategy allows a step-by-step debugging of the transformation rules, and the third strategy is useful for analysing the reachability of some defined states which allows to verify whether unwanted situations may happen or not.",60104653,Universite Grenoble Alpes,Saint Martin d'Heres,France,['1700'],27.285714285714285,0.03706709956709956,0.358008658008658,0
1392,1392,OTEC potential studies for energy sustainability in Riau Islands," All rights reserved.Interest in the use of alternative renewable energy resources has been developed recently due to increased energy consumption and depletion of fossil fuel reserves. A major concern the world to reduce is dependence impact from fossil fuel consumption with renewable energy. Renewable energy sources have enormous economic, environmental benefits and provide energy security. The most potential renewable energy sources of ocean energy include Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC). OTEC is a technology to generate electricity using a heat source thermal energy stored in the sea and is becoming increasingly attractive option to supply additional energy for many tropical countries and islands such as Riau Islands. Two monitoring stations were collected in Bintan Island using CTD. CTD profiler allows to the determination of derived and relevant quantities in situ measurement ocean temperature per depth. The relationship between ocean temperature and ocean depth represented with Regression Model Fit Analysis (RMFA). RMFA models to estimates ocean temperature profiles from CTD measurements.

1393,1393,Spectral responsivity measurements of monolithic GaInP2/InGaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells,"GaInP2/InGaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells have become the main energy source for space on-orbit applications. For the sake of the three composed sub-cells, including GaInP2, InGaAs and Ge sub-cell, the monolithic triple-junction solar cells can make use of solar irradiance in the wavelength range of 300 nm to 1800 nm. Before assembled into space solar arrays, each solar cell's current-voltage curves should be measured in laboratories on earth by AM0 solar simulators, to know their key parameters especially short circuit current. Solar cell's current-matching is crucial for assembling into arrays. While spectral responsivity is essential for spectral mismatch factors (MMFs) calculation during the current-voltage measurement. MMF corresponding to each sub-cell should be analyzed, so spectral responsivity of each sub-cell of monolithic solar cell was required to be measured out. But sub-cells are connected in series in a monolithic multijunction solar cell, and current-limiting effect makes traditional spectral responsivity measurement which is suitable for single-junction solar cells not applicable anymore. For measuring the spectral responsivity of monolithic multi-junction solar cells, optimized bias light and bias voltage are required to make the tested target sub-cell be the current-limiting one. The wavelength range and irradiance intensity of the bias light, the direction and value of the bias voltage, should be chose and adjusted appropriately during the measurement, otherwise will lead to measurement artifacts and obtain incorrect results. In this paper, combing optimization of bias light and bias voltage with monochromatic light system, we would present method and detailed procedures for measuring the spectral responsivity of monolithic GaInP2/InGaAs/Ge triple-junction space solar cells.",60010461,National Institute of Metrology China,Beijing,China,['1706'],25.7,0.2144444444444444,0.6122222222222222,1

1398,1398,A novel calibration transfer method of NIR spectra to identify ultra-low concentration of pesticide residues,"Conventional chemical methods to detect pesticide residue are complex, and need professional instruments as well as much time. NIR spectral analysis provides an effective way for pesticide residue detection because of simple operation, rapid analysis and non-destruction of samples. However, conventional calibration models are only effective after spectra were measured, and different models are needed for different instruments. In this study, we propose a novel calibration transfer method by using sequential forward selection to transfer calibration models between different crops and instruments. The calibration model built by master instrument can identify three kinds of pesticide including Chlorothalonil, Chlorpyrifos and Buprofezin. Spectra obtained by slave instrument can also be predicted by the models with the method.

There is considerable work in the area of visual odometry (VO), and recent advances in deep learning have brought novel approaches to VO, which directly learn salient features from raw images. These learning-based approaches have led to more accurate and robust VO systems. However, they have not been well applied to point cloud data yet. In this work, we investigate how to exploit deep learning to estimate point cloud odometry (PCO), which may serve as a critical component in point cloud-based downstream tasks or learning-based systems. Specifically, we propose a novel end-to-end deep parallel neural network called DeepPCO, which can estimate the 6-DOF poses using consecutive point clouds.

1404,1404,Control of the sit-to-stand transfer of a biped robotic device for postural rehabilitation,"This paper deals with the control of the sit-to-stand transfer of a biped robotic device (either an autonomous biped robot or a haptic assistive exoskeleton for postural rehabilitation). The control has been synthesized, instead of considering the physiology, analyzing the basic laws of dynamics. The transfer of a human from sitting on a chair to an erect posture is an interesting case study, because it treats biped balance in a two-phase dynamic setting, with an external force disturbance (the chair-pelvis contact) affecting the center of pressure under the feet. At the beginning, a body is sitting, with a fixed pelvis moving with the hips going toward the supporting feet and, contemporaneously, releasing the load from the chair with ankles and knee torques. Then, after lift-off, it reaches and maintains an erect posture. The paper objectives are threefold: identifying the major dynamical determinants of the exercise; sythesizing an automatic control for an autonomous device; proposing an innovative approach for the rehabilitation process with an exoskeleton. For this last objective, the paper extends the idea of the authors of a haptic exoskeleton for rehabilitation. It is driven to control the joints by electromiographical signals from the patient. The two spaces, cartesian (world) and joint, where, respectively, the automatic control and the patient operate, are considered and a technique to blend the two actions is proposed. The exoskeleton is programed to perform the exercise autonomously. Then, during the evolution of the phases of rehabilitation, we postulated to seamlessly move the control from one space (purely autonomous) to another (completely driven by the patient), choosing and keeping the postural tasks and joints (heaps, knees, or ankles) on which to apply each one of the two actions without interaction.",60012162,Politecnico di Torino,Turin,Italy,['1702'],25.818181818181817,0.150625,0.34041666666666665,1

One of the main characteristics of the PGM is that it can be actuated by low air pressure. In the present study, the static and dynamic characteristics of the PGM have been reported. The study of the PGM static characteristics has been performed with the help of a MATLAB simulation model. It has also been proven that the analytical and simulated results are similar in nature. The dynamic characteristics are also studied and the maximum torque generated by the PGM has been derived.

A low cost inertial measurement Unit (IMU) and magnetometer are mounted on the spherical robot and the measured data are fused with EKF to determine the attitude of the robot. The attitude of a spherical robot is a time-parameterized curve in SO(3) and hence is ideal for validating its attitude globally. An indoor experiment was carried by dead-reckoning on circular and trifolium trajectory. The ground truth was established by integrating the robot kinematics using the estimated attitude and then comparing it with the reference trajectory.

1432,1432,A principled formulation of integrating objects in Monocular SLAM," All rights reserved.Monocular SLAM is a well-studied problem and has shown significant progress in recent years, but still, challenges remain in creating a rich semantic description of the scene. Feature-based visual SLAMs are vulnerable to erroneous pose estimates due to insufficient tracking of mapped points or motion induced errors such as in large or in-place rotations. We present a new SLAM framework in which we use monocular edge based SLAM [1], along with category level models, to localize objects in the scene as well as improve the camera trajectory. In monocular SLAM systems, the camera track tends to break in conditions with abrupt motion which leads to reduction in the number of 2D point correspondences. In order to tackle this problem, we propose the first most principled formulation of its kind which integrates object category models in the core SLAM back-end to jointly optimize for the camera trajectory, object poses along with its shape and 3D structure. We show that our joint optimization is able to recover a better camera trajectory in such cases, as compared to Edge SLAM. Moreover, this method gives a better visualization incorporating object representations in the scene along with the 3D structure of the base SLAM system, which makes it useful for augmented reality (AR) applications.",60069548,Tata Consultancy Services India,Pune,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",30.285714285714285,0.10479282622139766,0.504354772211915,0

1447,1447,A new method for MAGDM based on improved TOPSIS and a novel pythagorean fuzzy soft entropy,"A decision-making environment is full of uncertainty and complexity. Existing tools include fuzzy sets, soft sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) and so on. Compared with intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), PFSs proposed by Yager have advantages in handling vagueness in the real world and possess good symmetry. The entropy measure is the most widespread form of uncertainty measure. In this paper, we improve the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to better deal with multiple-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems based on Pythagorean fuzzy soft sets (PFSSs). To better determine the weights of attributes, we firstly define a novel Pythagorean fuzzy soft entropy which is more reasonable and valid. Meanwhile the entropy has good symmetry. Entropy for PFSSs which is used to determine the subjective weights of attributes is also defined. Then we introduce a measure to calculate integrated weights by combining objective weights and subjective weights. Based on the integrated weights, the TOPSIS method is generalized and improved to solve the MAGDM problem. A distance measure taking into account the characteristics of Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (PFNs) is used to calculate distance between alternatives and ideal solutions. Finally, the proposed MAGDM method is applied in the case of selecting a missile position. Compared with other methods, it is shown that the proposed method can rank alternatives more reasonably and have higher distinguishability.",60069720,Air Force Engineering University China,Xi'an,China,['1701'],17.692307692307693,0.2965909090909091,0.5458333333333333,1

1472,1472,Sugar production forecasting system in PTPN XI Semboro Jember using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method," All rights reserved.There is a lot of entrepreneurial competition in the production of goods or services in the world, especially in Indonesia, especially the production of staple goods, namely sugar. The problem that is often faced at Sugar Factory PTPN XI Semboro Jember is the lack of management that is neatly organized and efficient, which makes this company less working optimally. Often there is a lack and excess of sugar production which makes the sugar does not have the maximum value, the sugar has been damaged, and sales at a reduced price because the sugar is not as efficient as the initial product. From these various problems, it can reduce profits from the company. From these problems it can be concluded that the company needs a system that can organize the management of the company, and is able to forecast production in the future. In this research will make a forecasting system using the method of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), where this method is divided into three methods, namely the Autoregressive (AR) method, the Moving Average (MA) method, and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method, which preceded by checking stationary data, and modeling the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method. Forecasting is done using production data for the previous 12 years from the company. The system is made to facilitate management that is less organized and displays predictions for the next production period. The results of this forecasting system are to determine the amount of production each year needed in this company. From the results of the ARIMA method modeling, the right ARIMA method is obtained by the ARIMA / AR (1,0,0), ARIMA / MA (0,0,1), and ARIMA (1,0,1) methods. The test results found that the average value of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in the Autoregressive (AR) method was 17%, the Moving Average (MA) method was 19%, and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method was 15%.",60069412,Universitas Jember,Jember,Indonesia,"['1701', '1710']",29.181818181818183,-0.04383928571428571,0.4236607142857144,0

1475,1475,PID controller design for mobile robot using bat algorithm with mutation (BAM)," All rights reserved.By definition, a mobile robot is a type of robot that has capability to move in a certain kind of environment and generally used to accomplish certain tasks with some degrees of freedom (DoF). Applications of mobile robots cover both industrial and domestic area. It may help to reduce risk to human being and to the environment. Mobile robot is expected to operate safely where it must stay away from hazards such as obstacles. Therefore, a controller needs to be designed to make the system robust and adaptive. In this study, PID controller is chosen to control a mobile robot. PID is considered as simple yet powerful controller for many kind of applications. In designing PID, user needs to set appropriate controller gain to achieve a desired performance of the control system, in terms of time response and its steady state error. Here, an optimization algorithm called Bat Algorithm with Mutation (BAM) is proposed to optimize the value of PID controller gain for mobile robot. This algorithm is compared with a well-known optimization algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The result shows that BAM has better performance compared to PSO in term of overshoot percentage and steady state error. BAM gives 2.29% of overshoot and 2.94% of steady state error. Meanwhile, PSO gives 3.07% of overshoot and 3.72% of steady state error.",60109118,Universitas Budi Luhur,Jakarta,Indonesia,"['1701', '1710']",17.23076923076923,0.2247619047619048,0.49499999999999994,0

Several previous studies have been carried out to test the performance of L3 function on virtualization using software-based and obtained positive result for the performance over the physical-based. While the previous studies were limited only within the scope of testing environment, this paper tries to extend the study not only limited to the performance test based-on RFC 2544 standard, but also implementation in the production environment using virtual machine (VM) approach. Mikrotik CHR (Cloud Hosted Router) designed specifically for virtualization environment will be used as the L3 platform on the VM. Implementation in the production environment was conducted at University computer laboratory that has 207 desktops (190 in the form of virtual desktops, 17 in the form of PCs) not including user' devices that connected via WiFi networks. VM-based approach for routing functions (Layer 3) using Mikrotik CHR has proven to be stable and sufficient for use in the computer laboratory after 6 months of usage. Performance test also shown that VM-based L3 function had higher transfer rates; physical-based router was about 23,4% slower for 1 routing load and 4,25% slower for 2 routings load. The characteristic of VM itself also add some benefits like VM snapshot and migration for recovery.

Standard distillation relies on ''dark knowledge'' for successful knowledge transfer.

We achieve this by using teacher loss as a confidence score which places variable relative importance on the teacher prediction. We inject this confidence score to the main training task via Attentive Imitation Loss (AIL) and when learning the intermediate representation of the teacher through Attentive Hint Training (AHT) approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which successfully distill the knowledge from a deep pose regression network.

The energy functional to be minimized is defined by the weighted sum of three terms, namely an fidelity term for the noise component, a Tikhonov regularization term for the smooth component and a total variation (TV)-like non-convex term for the piecewise constant component. The last term is parametrized such that the free scalar parameter allows to tune its degree of non-convexity and, hence, to separate the piecewise constant component more effectively than by using a classical convex TV regularizer without renouncing to convexity of the total energy functional. A method is also presented for selecting the two regularization parameters. The unique solution of the proposed variational model is determined by means of an efficient ADMM-based minimization algorithm.

1505,1505,Motion planning of a 14 DOF biped robot for crossing an irregular shape ditch using a new speed function incorporating terrain features and biped dynamics, The path planner models this problem as a wavefront propagation in a Nonuniform medium. The Eikonal equation is a mathematical representation of this problem. To solve this equation a speed function value at each node of discretized terrain surface is deined by using the local geometry of terrain and the ditch in the vicinity of node and dynamic behavior of biped robot at that node. The solution of the eikonal equation gives a potential surface of the terrain. Gradient descent algorithm provides a path on this potential surface. A dataset which consists of a collection of energy optimal and dynamically balanced gaits (hip and foot trajectories) of a 14 DOF biped robot for walking on uneven terrain is created by using a genetic algorithm. This dataset is generalized by using a feedforward neural-network by training the network with stochastic conjugate gradient algorithm. The footstep planner sequentially plans the feasible footsteps along the obtained path with minimum deviation by geometric method. The trained neural network estimates the hip and foot trajectories for each step along the path so that the biped robot can follow the path by crossing the encountered ditch successfully in an energy-optimal way. The proposed method is validated by simulation of a 14 DOF biped robot for the walk between an initial point and goal point on a terrain containing an irregular shape ditch.,60021988,Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,Kanpur,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.7,0.06875,0.4145833333333334,0

This is primarily achieved by reformulating the velocity obstacle to adapt to an ego-centric framework. This is a significant step towards improving real time implementations of collision avoidance in dynamic environments as there is no dependency on state estimation techniques to infer the robot pose and velocity.

The Q-CSIT is aimed to estimate the faded wireless channel with a limited/finite number of bits. The finite number of feedback bits trigger the SN adapt automatically its AMC modes. Adaptation of the AMC modes causes a changing of transmit power and transmission rate, these changes will make a better probability of error.

1541,1541,Genetic algorithm with random crossover and dynamic mutation on bin packing problem," All rights reserved.Bin Packing Problem (BPP) is a problem that aims to minimize the number of container usage by maximizing its contents. BPP can be applied to a case, such as maximizing the printing of a number of stickers on a sheet of paper of a certain size. Genetic Algorithm is one way to overcome BPP problems. Examples of the use of a combination of BPP and Genetic Algorithms are applied to printed paper in Digital Printing companies. Genetic Algorithms adopt evolutionary characteristics, such as selection, crossover and mutation. Repeatedly, Genetic Algorithms produce individuals who represent solutions. However, this algorithm often does not achieve maximum results because it is trapped in a local search and a case of premature convergence. The best results obtained are not comprehensive, so it is necessary to modify the parameters to improve this condition.

1543,1543,Characterization and lubrication of tube-guided shape-memory alloy actuators for smart textiles,"Smart textiles are flexible materials with interactive capabilities such as sensing, actuation, and computing, and in recent years have garnered considerable interest. Shape-memory alloy (SMA) wire is well-suited for smart textiles due to its high strength, small size, and low mass. However, the contraction of SMA wire is low, limiting its usefulness. One solution to increasing net contraction is to use a long SMA wire and guide it inside a tube that is wound back and forth or coiled inside a smart textile. In this article, we characterize the performance of tube-guided SMA wire actuators. We investigate the effect of turn radius and number of loops, showing that the stroke of an SMA-based system can be improved by up to 69.81% using the tube-guided SMA wire actuator concept. Finally, we investigate how tube-guided SMA wire actuators can be lubricated to improve their performance.

One of them is fish eggs in a group. Fish cultivators need precision in calculations, because currently conventional methods often make errors in calculations. If the calculation is wrong, it will have an impact on production and sales that are not balanced (loss). Small and easily broken fish eggs are grouped and it is difficult to do manual calculations. The purpose of this study is to test which segmentation method is the most optimal in calculating these grouped fish egg objects and produce precise and fast calculations.

1548,1548,Efficient closed-form task space manipulability for a 7-DOF serial robot,"With the increasing demand for robots to react and adapt to unforeseen events, it is essential that a robot preserves agility at all times. While manipulability is a common measure to quantify agility at a given joint configuration, an efficient direct evaluation in task space is usually not possible with conventional methods, especially for redundant robots with an infinite number of Inverse Kinematic solutions. Yet, this is essential for global online optimization of a robot posture. In this work, we derive analytical expressions for a conventional 7-degrees of freedom (7-DOF) serial robot structure, which enable the direct evaluation of manipulability from a reduced task space parametrization. The resulting expressions allow array operation and thus achieve very high computational efficiency with vector-optimized programming languages. This direct and simultaneous calculation of the task space manipulability for large numbers of poses benefits many optimization problems in robotic applications. We show applications in global optimization of robot mounting poses, as well as redundancy resolution with global online optimization w.r.t. manipulability.",60117641,"Fakultät für Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik, Technische Universität München",Munich,Germany,['1702'],20.75,0.0186984126984127,0.39138095238095244,1

1553,1553,Numerical study on swimming performance based on flapping orientations of caudal fins for bio-robotic systems," .$15.00Set in the context of the development of bio-inspired robotics systems, this paper seeks to understand the influence of the choice of the flapping orientation of fins on the propulsive performance of small underwater vehicles. In particular, the thunniform mode of Body and/or Caudal Fin (BCF) propelled systems is studied. This research is motivated by the fact that not much literature is available on the influence of flapping orientation of marine organisms and a number of mechanisms are found in nature. Dorso-ventral flapping with a positive metacentric height is shown to yield better self-stabilizing effects and lesser energy consumption compared to sideways flapping. Moreover, with dorso-ventral flapping, the choice of metacentric height could lead to the possibility of adjusting the body’s rotational oscillation amplitudes to positively affect the downstream fluid interactions for the caudal fin. This is not possible with sideways flapping where the designer would be forced to change the flapping kinematics or the body shape in the sagittal plane, to adjust the body oscillation amplitudes. While the main body of results are obtained using simulations for underwater vehicle dynamics with coefficients of the REMUS underwater vehicle, stability analysis for a generalised case is also presented.",60025757,Indian Institute of Technology Madras,Chennai,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",28.285714285714285,0.08648989898989899,0.4214646464646465,0

In order to reduce the measurement uncertainty, a standard lamp based on LED filament is developed. The lamp is free of cumbersome cooling devices, and its luminous intensity distribution is uniform in 4πgeometry. However, its luminous flux is sensitive to the ambient temperature. Therefore, a linear model of luminous flux as a function of ambient temperature and the lamp voltage is established. Then driven by a constant current, the lamp voltage, the relative luminous flux and the ambient temperature of the LED standard lamp are monitored. The model parameters can be obtained from the test data. Finally, by measuring the lamp voltage, the luminous flux drift caused by the ambient temperature can be compensated, so that the luminous flux of the LED standard lamp maintains a stable magnitude.",60010461,National Institute of Metrology China,Beijing,China,['1706'],20.25,0.14305555555555557,0.47268518518518515,1

In general most of visual servoing techniques use camera velocity as control input. In this paper, camera acceleration is used for deriving the control law. The use of acceleration input can accomplish smoother operating trajectory. However, this controller requires the first order feature measurement which may not be available. In this paper, to circumvent the issue, a time-delayed approximation is used for the non-measurable system states. The controller parameters are obtained from the stability analysis of the closed-loop time-delay system using Lyapunov-Razumikhin approach. The implemented controller is able to track the desired feature smoothly.

1599,1599,Supercomputer docking,"This review is based on the peer-reviewed research literature including the author's own publications devoted to supercomputer docking. The general view on docking and its role at the initial stage of the rational drug design is presented. Molecules of medicine compounds selectively bind to the active site of a protein, which is responsible for the disease progression, and stop it. Docking programs perform positioning of molecules (ligands) in the active site of the protein and estimate the protein-ligand binding energy. The larger this energy is, the less concentration of the respective compound should be used to observe the desired effect. Several classical docking programs are described in short. Examples of the adaptation of existing docking programs to supercomputing and using them for virtual screening of millions of ligands are presented. Two novel generalized docking programs specially designed for multi-core docking of a single ligand on a supercomputer are described shortly. These programs find a sufficiently wide spectrum of low energy minima of a protein-ligand complex in the frame of a given force field. The quasi-docking procedure using the generalized docking program is described. Quasi-docking allows to perform docking with quantum-chemical semiempirical methods.

However, recent years have witnessed the birth of a new music video genre that places a greater emphasis on words than is usually the case, namely the so-called lyric video, that is defined by graphically replicating the sung lyrics as text in the image. This essay traces the development and definition of this particular music video genre, providing theoretical reflections on the role played by words and lyrics in music video in general and in lyric videos in particular. It is argued that lyric videos in fact run counter to what we normally expect of music videos. This is demonstrated through an in-depth analysis of SOPHIE's 'Faceshopping' that reads as a critique of the lyric video genre from within the genre itself.

However, the traditional metrologies could not satisfy the measurement requirements of high precision and real-time due to the complex surface morphology of corrugated plate. In this paper, a preliminary study of application of the laser displacement sensor to the automatic on-line measurement of the corrugation height has been verified experimentally. To improve the measurement accuracy and efficiency, the data processing is divided into two parts: the measuring error analysis and the data fitting. An empirical correction model is established on the evaluation test to correct the errors caused by the incident angle at each measurement point. After that, by giving a segmentation to the cross sectional data from the geometrical characteristics of measured plate, the regression models of each interval data are established by the Least Square Method. Finally, the corrugation height of each subsection interval can be estimated from the difference between the minimum and maximum depth of each piecewise regression model.

By avoiding to measure the linear actuators' lengths and by using orientations instead, a comprehensive, low-cost sensor structure can be obtained that provides a unique solution for the direct kinematics problem. As a representative example, we apply our approach to the planar 3-RPR parallel mechanism, where P denotes active prismatic joints and R denotes passive revolute joints, and investigate the achievable accuracy and robustness on a specially designed experimental device. In this context, we also investigate the effect of sensor fusion on the achievable accuracy and compare our results with those obtained from linear actuators' lengths when the Newton-Raphson algorithm is used to compute the manipulator platform's pose iteratively.

If prediction of colors to be observed becomes possible, it will be advantageous for the purpose of investigations of the material. The authors previously succeeded in establishing a theoretical mathematical expression for realizing predictions of changes in the angle of rotation as well as resultant changes in visible colors of polarized white-color light beams transmitting in sugared water as an optically active material. In this study, for the purpose of confirming whether the mathematical expression is applicable for any other optically active materials, commercially available syrup was employed as the optically active material. The angle of rotation was first determined through measurements, and visible colors of transmitted light beams were observed. In addition, the spectra of transmitted light beams were also measured. On the other hand, the changes in visible colors were predicted by employing the authors' mathematical expression. As a result, roughly satisfactory matchings were confirmed between the actually measured or observed results and the predictions.

1644,1644,"A pressure field model for fast, robust approximation of net contact force and moment between nominally rigid objects","We introduce Pressure Field Contact (PFC), an approximate model for predicting the contact surface, pressure distribution, and net contact wrench between nominally rigid objects. PFC combines and generalizes two ideas: A bed of springs (an 'elastic foundation') and hydrostatic pressure. Continuous pressure fields are computed offline for the interior of each nominally rigid object. Unlike hydrostatics or elastic foundations, the pressure fields need not satisfy mechanical equilibrium conditions. When two objects nominally overlap, a contact surface is defined where the two pressure fields are equal. This static pressure is supplemented with a dissipative rate-dependent pressure and friction to determine tractions on the contact surface. The contact wrench between pairs of objects is an integral of traction contributions over this surface. PFC evaluates much faster than elasticity-theory models, while showing the essential trends of force, moment, and stiffness increase with contact load. It yields continuous wrenches even for non-convex objects and coarse meshes. The method shows promise as sufficiently fast, accurate, physical, and robust for robotics applications including motion and tactile sensor simulation, controller learning and synthesis, state estimation, and design-in-simulation.",60007776,Cornell University,Ithaca,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",18.0,0.09000000000000001,0.41261904761904766,1

1654,1654,Self-supervised difference detection for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation,"To minimize the annotation costs associated with the training of semantic segmentation models, researchers have extensively investigated weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. In the current weakly-supervised segmentation methods, the most widely adopted approach is based on visualization. However, the visualization results are not generally equal to semantic segmentation. Therefore, to perform accurate semantic segmentation under the weakly supervised condition, it is necessary to consider the mapping functions that convert the visualization results into semantic segmentation. For such mapping functions, the conditional random field and iterative re-training using the outputs of a segmentation model are usually used. However, these methods do not always guarantee improvements in accuracy; therefore, if we apply these mapping functions iteratively multiple times, eventually the accuracy will not improve or will decrease. In this paper, to make the most of such mapping functions, we assume that the results of the mapping function include noise, and we improve the accuracy by removing noise. To achieve our aim, we propose the self-supervised difference detection module, which estimates noise from the results of the mapping functions by predicting the difference between the segmentation masks before and after the mapping. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by performing experiments on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes 2012 dataset, and we achieved 64.9% in the val set and 65.5% in the test set.

Due to the brittleness and hardness of optical materials, micro-powder diamond wheel is easy to wear during grinding process, which affects the surface roughness and depth of sub-surface damage layer of components. In order to accurately characterize the wear state of diamond wheel in the grinding process, a method based on in-situ micro-observation of grinding wheel and abrasive particle image contour recognition was proposed to detect the diamond wheel. First, based on the grinding experiments, the surface micromorphology of grinding wheel was acquired by in-situ microscopic observation, and the wear forms of the grinding wheel were analyzed. Then the average distribution density of wear particles and average wear area were taken as the evaluation parameters of the wear state of the wheel. After outstanding the edge profile of abrasive particles by Laplacian enhancement operator and binary processing, the edge profiles of wear particles were extracted out. And by calculating the number and projection area of each wear abrasive particles, the average distribution density of wear particles and the average wear area in the measured region on the surface of grinding wheel were obtained. At the end, the wear state of resin bonded diamond grinding wheel used for grinding fused silica optics was tested.

Besides, information on electricity consumption can help consumers carry out an evaluation process to reduce electricity bill costs, which indirectly affect overall energy efficiency. One method in the process of monitoring electricity consumption is Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). The main problem in NILM is to determine the energy disaggregation consumed by several equipment by merely performing the retrieval of data from only one measuring point. We used the Superstate Hidden Markov Model as the tool for modelling and analysis. A median data filter to the input data is applied to improve the performance of the disaggregation process.

1680,1680,Scale estimation of monocular SLAM using direct acceleration pair measurements,"Monocular SLAM is increasingly being used to provide navigation solutions for autonomous systems. In this, a visual inertial solution is commonly used to get the scale factor estimate for the monocular SLAM problem where the acceleration data from IMU is integrated to get the absolute velocity and position estimates. Since the accelerometer data may have bias and inaccuracies, it may lead to accumulation of bias and noise errors resulting in drift from the true value positions. This may require an additional sensor to correct the drift. In this paper, the scale factor is estimated using the average acceleration pair data of SLAM and IMU and without any third sensor. For accounting the noise on average accelerations, the Maximum Likelihood estimator is proposed. The scale factor is therefore recovered without any integration of IMU acceleration avoiding any drift errors, improving the estimation of scale factor values. This scale estimation method is included in the ORB-SLAM algorithm in a separate thread for real-time implementation. The output of maximum likelihood estimator is compared with simple estimators namely arithmetic mean, geometric mean and median. The real time formulation developed is validated in experiments using an off the self commercial OptiTrack motion capture system. The present approach gives a robust and less complex estimate of scale factor purely from camera and IMU in the presence of noise on acceleration pairs.",60121522,Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR),Ghaziabad,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",20.454545454545453,-0.012632275132275132,0.38048941798941793,1

The authors characterize the causes of PD occurrence and their impact on the insulation condition. The article provides information on the on-line monitoring system applied at high-voltage transformers of superpowered arc steel-melting furnaces and ladle furnaces at metallurgical plants. The system implements (among other methods) the method of diagnosing the insulation state by means of mathematical processing of PD parameters. Continuously measured values are apparent charge and the parameter called partial discharge intensity (PDI) characterizing the power and intensity of PD. The authors studied the parameter trends and conducted the statistical processing of the measurements results. In addition, the authors give the rationale for the application of the parameter ""reciprocal stochastic connection force"" between the PD amplitude and PDI as a generalized criterion of the insulation state and failure localization. The article compares trends of power and PD amplitude at various transformer technical states (before and after unscheduled repair).

Devices composed of two extra fingers are preferred with respect to single finger devices when reliable grasps, resistance to external disturbances, and higher payloads are required. Underactuation and compliance are design choices that can reduce the device complexity and weight, maintaining the adaptability to different grasped objects. When only one motor is adopted to actuate multiple fingers, a differential mechanism is necessary to decouple finger movements and distribute forces. In this paper, the main features of a wearable device composed of two robotic extra fingers are described and analyzed in terms of kinematics, statics, and mechanical resistance. Each finger is composed of modular phalanges and is actuated with a single tendon. Interphalangeal joints include a passive elastic element that allows restoring the initial reference configuration when the tendon is released.

1705,1705,High accurate three-dimensional shape measurement of discontinuous specular surfaces by stereo direct phase-measuring deflectometry,"With the fast development of integrated circuits, photovoltaics, automobile industry, advanced manufacturing, and astronomy, it is particularly important to obtain the three-dimensional (3D) shape data of specular objects quickly and accurately. Owing to the advantages of large dynamic range, non-contact operation, full-field and fast acquisition, high accuracy, and automatic data processing, phase-measuring deflectometry (PMD, also called fringe reflection profilometry) has been widely studied and applied in many fields. Direct PMD (DPMD) can directly establish the relationship between phase and depth data without gradient integration process, so it can be used for 3D shape measurement of specular objects having discontinuous surfaces. However, compared with gradient data, depth data is more sensitive to measurement noise, so the measurement accuracy obtained by gradient field integration is higher. In order to make use of the anti-noise property of gradient measurement structure, some PMD techniques usually abandon the height data obtained from the intermediate process and use the gradient data to complete the surface reconstruction. Stereo deflectometry is a typical representative to retrieve 3D shape of the measured object according to the gradient integration. It calculates the gradient field based on the uniqueness of the normal vector of the object points by using two cameras. Although obtaining high-precision measurement results, this method cannot be used for the measurement of discontinuous objects. In this paper, a new stereo DPMD method is proposed to obtain 3D shape of specular objects having discontinuous surfaces. Some experimental results on measuring discontinuous specular objects verify the high precision of the proposed stereo DPMD method.",60032389,Hebei University of Technology,Tianjin,China,['1706'],25.4,0.17336156597026164,0.5157876905702993,1

1718,1718,Detection of EEG signal post-stroke using FFT and convolutional neural network," All rights reserved.Stroke is a condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is disrupted or reduced. It may be caused by a blockage (ischemic stroke) or rupture of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke) so that it can cause disability. Therefore patients need to undergo rehabilitation. One of the procedures of monitoring of the recovery of stroke patients using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) method, but sometimes subjectively. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an instrument that can measure electrical activity in the brain, including abnormalities caused by stroke. This study investigates EEG signal detection in post-stroke patients using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) extraction can increase accuracy from 60% to 80.3% from the use of Adam's optimization model. Meanwhile, the AdaDelta model gave 20% accuracy without FFT. And its condition increased to 79.9% with FFT extraction. Therefore, Adam's stability has the advantage of remembering to use hyper-parameter. On the other hand, FFT is beneficial for directing information used for the use of 1D CNN, thus increasing accuracy. The results showed that using of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in identification could increase accuracy by 45-80% compared to identification using only 1D CNN. Meanwhile, the results of the study show that the relative weight correction model using Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) provided higher accuracy compared to the Adaptive learning rate (AdaDelta).

1720,1720,Phase correction method for dynamic 3D measurement based on fringe projection,"An additional phase shift is produced when the 3D shape of dynamic scene is measured by phase shifting method. The phase distribution measured by traditional method is distorted and the recovered 3D shape is distorted as well. The Gerchberg iteration algorithm and the windowed Fourier assisted phase shifting method were proposed to reduce the distortion. The main ideal of these methods is to accurately estimate the phase shift between two fringe patterns. The accuracy of phase shift estimation is low near the edge where the frequency of fringe changes suddenly. We proposed a method to increase the accuracy of phase shift estimation. The edge of frequency sudden change is found out and then the fringe pattern is divided into different regions. The Gerchberg iteration algorithm is adopted to extend the fringe to outside of every region. The windowed Fourier analysis is adopted to estimate phase of every region and then the phase distribution of whole pattern is obtained. The phase shift between two fringe patterns is obtained by subtracting the estimated phase of first pattern from that of second pattern. Finally, the accurate phase distribution is obtained from the fringe patterns and the estimated phase shifts by least square method. The comparative experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the accuracy of measured phase by proposed method is higher than that by windowed Fourier assisted phase shifting method.",60003078,Zhejiang Normal University,Jinhua,China,['1706'],18.076923076923077,0.1298245614035088,0.46842105263157896,1

A use case with a very detailed level can be a lot more useful for requirements elicitation, but such a model may become too complex and difficult to understand the whole context. A use case slice is introduced in order to simplify the requirements analysis and ensure the correctness of software incremental development process (e.g., the agile development process). However, a use case is usually divided into multiple use case slices in a manual way. Some errors may occur during this manual process. In this article, the authors present an automated approach for dividing a use case into use case slices. The approach first decomposes a use case into multiple use case stories, and then these stories can be composed into different use case slices according to different requirements.

1728,1728,Integral object mining via online attention accumulation,"Object attention maps generated by image classifiers are usually used as priors for weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. However, normal image classifiers produce attention only at the most discriminative object parts, which limits the performance of weakly-supervised segmentation task. Therefore, how to effectively identify entire object regions in a weakly-supervised manner has always been a challenging and meaningful problem. We observe that the attention maps produced by a classification network continuously focus on different object parts during training. In order to accumulate the discovered different object parts, we propose an online attention accumulation (OAA) strategy which maintains a cumulative attention map for each target category in each training image so that the integral object regions can be gradually promoted as the training goes. These cumulative attention maps, in turn, serve as the pixel-level supervision, which can further assist the network in discovering more integral object regions. Our method (OAA) can be plugged into any classification network and progressively accumulate the discriminative regions into integral objects as the training process goes. Despite its simplicity, when applying the resulting attention maps to the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation task, our approach improves the existing state-of-the-art methods on the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark, achieving a mIoU score of 66.4% on the test set.

We introduce a feature multiplier in our network that transforms the features of an image affected by the rain veiling effect into features that are less affected by it, which we call veiling-invariant features. We establish a new mapping operation in the feature space to produce streak-invariant features. The operation is based on a feature pyramid structure of the input images, and the basic idea is to preserve the chromatic features of the background scenes while canceling the rain-streak patterns. Both the veiling-invariant and streak-invariant features are computed and optimized automatically based on the the accuracy of our optical flow estimation. Our network is end-to-end, and handles both rain streaks and the veiling effect in an integrated framework.

The application of Big Data in the modern business allows enterprises to take faster and smarter decisions, achieving a real competitive advantage. However, a lot of Big Data projects provide disappointing results that don't address the decision-makers' needs due to many reasons. The main reason for this failure can be summarized in neglecting the study of the decision-making aspect of these projects.

1764,1764,Optimizing deep learning RNN topologies on intel architecture,"Recurrent neural network (RNN) models have been found to be well suited for processing temporal data. In this work, we present an optimized implementation of vanilla RNN cell and its two popular variants: LSTM and GRU for Intel Xeon architecture. Typical implementations of these RNN cells employ one or two large matrix multiplication (GEMM) calls and then apply the element-wise operations (sigmoid/tanh) onto the GEMM results. While this approach is easy to implement by exploiting vendor-optimized GEMM library calls, the data reuse relies on how GEMMs are parallelized and is sub-optimal for GEMM sizes stemming from small minibatch. Also, the element-wise operations are exposed as a bandwidth-bound kernel after the GEMM which is typically a compute-bound kernel. To address this discrepancy, we implemented a parallel blocked matrix GEMM in order to (a) achieve load balance, (b) maximize weight matrix reuse, (c) fuse the element-wise operations after partial GEMM blocks are computed and while they are hot in cache. Additionally, we bring the time step loop in our cell to further increase the weight reuse and amortize the overhead to transform the weights into blocked layout. The results show that our implementation is generally faster than Intel MKL-DNN library implementations, e.g. for RNN, forward pass is up to ~3x faster whereas the backward/weight update pass is up to ~5x faster. Furthermore, we investigate high-performance implementations of sigmoid and tanh activation functions that achieve various levels of accuracy. These implementations rely on minimax polynomial approximations, rational polynomials, Taylor expansions and exponential approximation techniques. Our vectorized implementations can be flexibly integrated into deep learning computations with different accuracy requirements without compromising performance; in fact, these are able to outperform vectorized and reduced accuracy vendor-optimized (Intel SVML) libraries by 1.6-2.6 x while speep up over GNU libm is close to two orders of magnitude.

1766,1766,Deep learning approaches for big data analysis," All rights reserved.Good representations of data eliminate irrelevant variability of the input data, while preserving the information that is useful for the ultimate task. Among the various ways for learning representation is using deep learning methods. Deep feature hierarchies are formed by stacking unsupervised modules on top of each other, forming multiple nonlinear transformations to produce better representations. In this talk, we will first show how deep learning is used for bioactivity prediction of chemical compounds. Molecules are represented as several convolutional neural networks to predict their bioactivity. In addition, a new concept of merging multiple convolutional neural networks and an automatic learning features representation for the chemical compounds was proposed using the values within neurons of the last layer of the CNN architecture. We will also show how the concepts of deep learning is adapted into a deep belief network (DBN) to enhance the molecular similarity searching. The DBN achieves feature abstraction by reconstruction weight for each feature and minimizing the reconstruction error over the whole feature set. The DBN is later enhanced using data fusion to obtain a lower detection error probability and a higher reliability by using data from multiple distributed descriptors. Secondly, we will show how we used deep learning for stock market prediction. Here, we developed a Deep Long Short Term Memory Network model that is able to forecast the crude palm oil price movement with combined factors such as other commodities prices, weather and news sentiments and price movement of crude palm oil. We also show how we combined stock markets price and financial news and deployed the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Word 2 Vector (Word2Vec) to project the stock prices for the following seven days. Finally, we will show how we exploited deep learning method for the opinion mining and later used it to extract the product's aspects from the user textual review for recommendation systems.

But at the beginning of the implementation of e-VB, there were several errors and constraints experienced by users so that an evaluation is needed to measure the extent of the quality of e-VB services. To measure the quality of e-VB service, this research used 33 attributes from 6 dimensions of e-GovQual; ease of use, trust, functionality of the interaction environment, reliability, content and performance of information, and citizen support.

1772,1772,FruTEG: A conceptual framework for utility evaluation in groupware,"The user experience is the form in which a user feels when using a product or service, for this reason the UX has become a fundamental factor in the success or failure of a product or service [12]. To achieve a good UX, a product must be useful to allow users to perform their tasks, and easy to use by the user (product usability). Both aspects affect the desirability of use that the product produces in the user, as well as the way in which a user experiences a certain brand. Different frameworks, methods and instruments to evaluate the software UX have been proposed. Groupware is a software that provide a group of users with means for communication, collaboration, coordination and regulation their activity in order to achieve a common goal [18]. In this context, we are interested in UX evaluation of groupware from the utility aspect. Because a product can be easy to use and even look attractive, however, if it does not allow the user to achieve their goals, the user will not want to continue using the product.

1773,1773,Actuation and stiffening in fluid-driven soft robots using low-melting-point material,"Soft material robots offer a number of advantages over traditional rigid robots in applications including human-robot interaction, rehabilitation and surgery. These robots can navigate around obstacles, elongate, squeeze through narrow openings or be squeezed - and they are considered to be inherently safe. The ability to stiffen compliant soft actuators has been achieved by embedding various mechanisms that are generally decoupled from the actuation principle. Miniaturisation becomes challenging due to space limitations which can in turn result in diminution of stiffening effects. Here, we propose to hydraulically actuate soft manipulators with low-melting-point material and, at the same time, be able to switch between a soft and stiff state. Instead of allocating an additional stiffening chamber within the soft robot, one chamber only is used for actuation and stiffening.

The key contributions of the proposed work include the design of a control law that reactively integrates the longitudinal surface gradient of the road into its operation. In contrast to the existing works, we found that integrating the path gradient into the control framework improves the speed tracking efficacy. Since the control law is implemented over a shrinking domain scheme, it minimizes the integrated error by recomputing the control inputs at every discretized step and consequently provides less reaction time. This makes our control law suitable for motion planning frameworks that are operating at high frequencies. Furthermore, our work is implemented using a generalized vehicle model and can be easily extended to other classes of vehicles. The performance of gradient aware - shrinking domain based controller is implemented and tested on an electric car.

1814,1814,Early detection application of bipolar disorders using backpropagation algorithm," All rights reserved.Mental health is an important aspect in realizing overall health and important to be considered as physical health. Mental disorders are classified as difficult to diagnose due to the similarity of symptoms that can occur. In addition, information about mental disorders is inadequate so that it can be difficult for experts to provide a diagnosis of the disorders experienced by patients. The difficulty of experts in diagnosing is usually caused by the similarity of symptoms in mental disorders, such as in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Based on these problems, this research would like to conduct an early detection study of bipolar disorder by using screening questionnaire data from 300 respondents and serve as a knowledge base to be processed using the backpropagation algorithm. Based on all the results of testing the backpropagation algorithm that has been done to find out the results obtained accuracy and the highest results of training, the highest results obtained with the total test data correct or suitable is 249 and the wrong data is 1 of 250 test data. If it is calculated by a formula, the resulting accuracy rate is 99.6%. And it can be concluded broadly that the greatest influence of the accuracy of the backpropagation algorithm is based on momentum. Because in testing momentum the highest accuracy can be produced compared to the results of other analyzes.",60087598,Universitas Pancasila,Jakarta,Indonesia,"['1701', '1710']",25.333333333333332,0.010119047619047625,0.5788265306122449,0

1819,1819,Spatial coordinate trial: Converting non-spatial data dimension for DBSCAN," All rights reserved.In big data, noise in data mining is a necessity. Its existence depends on data and algorithm, but it does not mean the algorithm caused noise. Although the advantages of the Density Based Spatial Clustering Application with Noise, DBSCAN algorithm, in executing spatial data (two-dimensional data) have been widely discussed, but it has not been convincing in executing non-spatial data. As an algorithm should perform well on any data for optimizing data mining, this research proposes a trial to convert dimensions of non-spatial data into 2 dimensions for executing with DBSCAN algorithm, and a different input value for epsilon to know about its minimum which begins arising noise in the execution. Method of analysis in trial is with considering the attributes of non-spatial data as variables that represent coordinate points, rather than cardinality. Technically, it is assumed that 2-dimensional coordinate axes as a spot point for coordinate with more than or equal 3 dimensions according to development of Cartesian coordinate system, by first paying attention to relationship of variables (attributes). This way is then called Spatial Coordinate. The different input values are with paying attention to numbers from non-zero minimum distance to the forth of epsilon where the epsilon is in integer. The results of trial and testing on clusters formed, with Silhouette Coefficient, point out that the clusters are well, strong, and quality enough. Therefore, this research gives a new way on how preprocessing non-spatial data for DBSCAN algorithm performance.",123934331,Informatics Engineering,Samarinda,Indonesia,"['1701', '1710']",24.4,0.12685335497835498,0.4541937229437229,0

An excellent single mode fiber (SMF) must provide a low attenuation and dispersion which occurs at same wavelength, i.e. 1550 nm. But, in silica based SMF, this property cannot be achieved in a bulk form. Meanwhile, the direct experiment is really not the best choice. Therefore, a simulation fiber design take a crucial role into account for obtaining zero dispersion shift. We design SMF geometry with zero dispersion by resizing the width of core and cladding. This design consists of inner and outer core-clad profile. We also provide several width boundaries for matching the lowest dispersion to the lowest attenuation in silica fiber-based. Moreover, the results shows that dispersion property of the design is suitable for long-haul optical communication systems.",60069417,Universitas Riau,Pekanbaru,Indonesia,"['1701', '1710']",13.272727272727273,0.2159047619047619,0.41306349206349213,0

This estimate works on an arbitrary time interval. On the other hand, the previously known Carleman estimate for the reversed time case works only on a sufficiently small time interval. First, a stability estimate is proven. Next, the quasi-reversibility numerical method is proposed for an arbitrary time interval for the linear case. This is unlike a sufficiently small time interval in the previous work. The convergence rate for the quasi-reversibility method is established. Finally, the quasilinear parabolic equation with reversed time is considered. A weighted globally strictly convex Tikhonov-like functional is constructed. The weight is the Carleman weight function which is involved in that Carleman estimate. The global convergence of the gradient projection method to the exact solution is proved for this functional.",60007457,Lomonosov Moscow State University,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1711', '1706']",13.636363636363637,-0.02220893141945773,0.41822169059011166,1

Recent literatures show that the imperfect of the imaging system in the structured light 3D metrology will cause the discontinuous-induced measurement artifact (DMA) in the area around the discontinuous edge. Existing DMA reduction methods need to detect the all edges accurately first. This procedure is hard to accomplish when the edges are defocused. Meanwhile, the corrected date in the error area relies heavily on the data in its nearest unaffected area, which makes the corrected data unreliable in some situations. In this work, a flexible deconvolution-based method is proposed to solve the above two problems in this paper.

The underlying mathematical problem is highly nonlinear, severely ill-posed, and several model parameters are usually not known accurately. Despite the strong nonlinearity, iterative Newton-type methods are widely used to tackle the problem numerically. This work presents and analyzes tailored transformations for the conductivity and for electrode parameters which are favourable in two regards: they remove the constrainedness of the unknown parameters and simultaneously decrease the nonlinearity of the underlying problem. We study the impact of various transformations on the nonlinearity of the problem and demonstrate improved speed of convergence for Newton-type methods while avoiding local minima in the solution space. The presented transformations can conveniently be incorporated into existing iterative solvers as they improve stability and do not require hand-tuned regularization parameters or line-search strategies, thereby bridging a gap between a variety of established conductivity estimation methods and practical applications.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,"['1711', '1706']",26.833333333333332,0.09183333333333334,0.3656666666666667,1

1854,1854,Near-field imaging of locally perturbed periodic surfaces,"This paper concerns the inverse scattering problem to reconstruct a locally perturbed periodic surface. Different from scattering problems with quasi-periodic incident fields and periodic surfaces, the scattered fields are no longer quasi-periodic. Thus the classical method for quasi-periodic scattering problems no longer works. The method based on the Floquet-Bloch transform provides an efficient numerical algorithm to solve the direct scattering problem, and a possibility to reconstruct both the unknown periodic part and the unknown local perturbation from the near-field data. By transforming the original scattering problem into one defined in an infinite rectangle, the information of the surface is included in the coefficients. The numerical scheme contains two steps. The first step is to obtain an initial guess from a sampling method. The second step is to reconstruct the surface. As is proved in the paper, for some incident fields, the corresponding scattered fields carry little information of the perturbation. In this case, we use these scattered fields to reconstruct the periodic surface. Then we could apply the data that carries more information of the perturbation to reconstruct the local perturbation. The Newton-CG method is applied to solve the associated optimization problems.

1870,1870,Configuration and registration of multi-camera spectral image database of icon paintings,"At the cost of added complexity and time, hyperspectral imaging provides a more accurate measure of the scene's irradiance compared to an RGB camera. Several camera designs with more than three channels have been proposed to improve the accuracy. The accuracy is often evaluated based on the estimation quality of the spectral data. Currently, such evaluations are carried out with either simulated data or color charts to relax the spatial registration requirement between the images. To overcome this limitation, this article presents an accurately registered image database of six icon paintings captured with five cameras with different number of channels, ranging from three (RGB) to more than a hundred (hyperspectral camera). Icons are challenging topics because they have complex surfaces that reflect light specularly with a high dynamic range. Two contributions are proposed to tackle this challenge. First, an imaging configuration is carefully arranged to control the specular reflection, confine the dynamic range, and provide a consistent signal-to-noise ratio for all the camera channels. Second, a multi-camera, feature-based registration method is proposed with an iterative outlier removal phase that improves the convergence and the accuracy of the process.

1873,1873,Sparsity promoting regularization for effective noise suppression in SPECT image reconstruction,"The purpose of this research is to develop an advanced reconstruction method for low-count, hence high-noise, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image reconstruction. It consists of a novel reconstruction model to suppress noise while conducting reconstruction and an efficient algorithm to solve the model. A novel regularizer is introduced as the nonconvex denoising term based on the approximate sparsity of the image under a geometric tight frame transform domain. The deblurring term is based on the negative log-likelihood of the SPECT data model. To solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem a preconditioned fixed-point proximity algorithm (PFPA) is introduced. We prove that under appropriate assumptions, PFPA converges to a local solution of the optimization problem at a global convergence rate. Substantial numerical results for simulation data are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in denoising, suppressing artifacts and reconstruction accuracy. We simulate noisy 2D SPECT data from two phantoms: hot Gaussian spheres on random lumpy warm background, and the anthropomorphic brain phantom, at high- and low-noise levels (64k and 90k counts, respectively), and reconstruct them using PFPA. We also perform limited comparative studies with selected competing state-of-the-art total variation (TV) and higher-order TV (HOTV) transform-based methods, and widely used post-filtered maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization. We investigate imaging performance of these methods using: contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), ensemble variance images (EVI), background ensemble noise (BEN), normalized mean-square error (NMSE), and channelized hotelling observer (CHO) detectability. Each of the competing methods is independently optimized for each metric. We establish that the proposed method outperforms the other approaches in all image quality metrics except NMSE where it is matched by HOTV. The superiority of the proposed method is especially evident in the CHO detectability tests results. We also perform qualitative image evaluation for presence and severity of image artifacts where it also performs better in terms of suppressing 'staircase' artifacts, as compared to TV methods. However, edge artifacts on high-contrast regions persist.

This happened because ship management center unable to monitor all the activities of the ship when the ship sailing in the middle of the ocean. Lately, ship monitoring through the latest technology are being carried out, one of which is the Machine to Machine (M2M) based Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) technology. The development of VMS and telemetry technology has enabled monitoring of engines and fuel consumption of ships in real time. The problem with this VMS system is that there is still a dependency on the analysis of experts who need a long time to analyze various parameters of existing telemetry data, which lead to inaccuracy and delay in anomaly detection. This study conducted a statistical analysis of telemetry data, especially in ship movement and machine activities, and then designed the fuel consumption regularity classification system with the Naive Bayes and Logistics Regression.

1882,1882,Transmission measurement by using different wavelengths than designed wavelength,"Testing wavefront distortions at the design wavelength is critical for optical system qualification. Existing technologies and methods for measuring transmitted wavefronts typically operate at only a few specific wavelengths. In previous research, we propose a method for estimating the wavefront distortion of an optical transmission system in a broad bandwidth. We establish the relationship between the transmitted wavefront and wavelength, using Zernike fringe coefficients to represent the wavefront. We have also experimentally tested a single lens represents the monochromatic transmission system at four wavelengths with interferometers. The results show the monotonic Zernike-wavelength curves of in 400∼1000nm bandwidth can be predicted by fitted Conrady formula with three data points. In this paper, we further test a doublet achromatic lens at five wavelengths with interferometers, and we find most Zernike-wavelength curves of the doublet achromatic lens are still monotonic, which can solved by binomial Conrady formula with two data points. Using three points to fit Conrady formula for part of monotonic curves is the same as using two points to solve binomial Conrady formula. However the Z8-wavelength curve which have an inflection point must solved by Conrady formula with three data points. The experimental results of achromatic system are more representative, it shows that Zernike-wavelength curve of achromatic system can be expressed by Conrady formula. In practice testing, if the wavefronts measuring at different wavelengths are accurate, the wavefront of arbitrarily wavelength in a certain band can be estimated by solving Conrady formula. Our experiment shows that the Conrady formula can represent the dispersion characteristics of some optical systems, especially for achromatic system. And the feasibility of measuring transmitted wavefront in a certain band based on Zernike coefficient is verified.

This method is in-situ measurement, so it can measure full-aperture surface of optics with arbitrary aperture and shape after rough grinding, semi-precision grinding and fine grinding. Orthogonal co-directional grating measurement path can effectively avoid the influence of machine backlash. Therefore, the optics can be directly compensated according to the results of surface measurement, so that the surface of optics can meet the requirements. After the measurement is completed, a set of orthogonal measurement data are obtained, and the invalid data are manually clipped. Linear interpolation, nearest neighbor interpolation and cubic spline interpolation are used to interpolate the clipped data, and the orthogonal data are superimposed to obtain the final shape. The validity of this method is verified by the sub-aperture surface detection method, experiments show that the optimal surface measurement results can be obtained by cubic interpolation for both planar and aspheric optics. Using this method to compensate the grinding of 530mm×530mm 2-D off-axis aspheric optics, the full-aperture surface shape accuracy PV is better than 3.5μm.",60069721,China Academy of Engineering Physics,Chengdu,China,['1706'],29.25,0.08673015873015873,0.5839047619047619,1

Precise photometric measurement results for those LED products are necessary due to needs of the international or domestic commercial trade. In the testing lab, people usually use photometer and related photometry equipment to measure LEDs. The photometer mimics the human eyes however it is not exactly the same. Thus, colour correction factor (CCF) is applied when the relative spectral response of the photometer S∗(λ) is different from the photopic luminous efficiency function V(λ). Since the CCF is the most significant uncertainty component in LED total luminous flux and averaged LED luminous intensity measurement, the evaluation of uncertainty of CCF become more important in National Institute of Metrology China (NIM).

This paper presents a novel design of a flexible gripper suitable for gripping circular objects having variable curvatures and different textures. Two rubber belts form the gripper arms, which are used for gripping objects. These rubber belts are attached to DC motors. The motors are fitted in the gripper base . Magnets are attached on the other ends along with an interlocking mechanism. The primary actuation in the gripper is brought about by the Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire fitted along the inner side of the rubber belts. On energizing the SMA, the rubber belts bend along with the pre-programmed SMA and the magnets on the two belts come closer. Subsequently, locking is achieved. This forms a loop around the gripping object. The grip of the rubber belts around the object is further tightened by winding them around the shafts of the motors to which they are attached.

This requires a lot of reprogramming, which is expensive because a specialized engineer is required. It would be an improvement if untrained workers could help a cobot to learn an assembly sequence by giving advice. Learning an assembly sequence is a hard task for a cobot, because the solution space increases drastically when the complexity of the task increases. This work introduces a novel method where human knowledge is used to reduce this solution space, and as a result increases the learning speed. The method proposed is the IRL-PBRS method, which uses Interactive Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to learn from human advice in an interactive way, and uses Potential Based Reward Shaping (PBRS), in a simulated environment, to focus learning on a smaller part of the solution space. The method was compared in simulation to two other feedback strategies. The results show that IRL-PBRS convergesmore quickly to a valid assembly sequence policy and does this with the fewest human interactions. Finally, a use case is presented where participants were asked to program an assembly task.

This has resulted in the increased demand and hence a need for their availability in India. In this paper, the design analysis of an indigenous industrial robot under development is reported. Based on the workspace requirements, sizes of the motors, gearboxes, etc., CAD model of a 6kg payload robot was developed. Its geometric parameters required for the kinematic analysis were determined and thereafter the CAD model of the robot was imported in RoboAnalyzer software. Cartesian motion for the end-effector for a typical pick and place operation was provided as input in RoboAnalyzer and the corresponding joint trajectories were obtained. These joint trajectories were then used as custom input in Autodesk Inventor and inverse dynamics analysis was performed to determine maximum torque at each joint, which helps in the selection of motor and gearbox. Further, the robot links were subjected to stress analysis and the components were tested to be safe. Thereafter the components were fabricated and assembled to obtain a physical prototype of the robot.

1923,1923,Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance in CG Space of a 10 DOF Rover using RRT,"There has been a recent demand for algorithms to plan the motion on 3D terrain for applications in space exploration, rescue and relief, unmanned vehicles, defense applications etc. Conventional path planning algorithms in 2D cannot be used in 3D as the work space cannot be divided into obstacles and free space. A few algorithms have been proposed for articulated rovers in 3D and they all require optimization to find the wheel and ground terrain contact and hence cannot be used in real time. In this paper, a new method is proposed to find the path in the CG space of a 10 DOF rover without the need for optimization. This CG space planning method can operate in real time. The CG space is the collection of possible CG points of the rover on a given terrain that is similar to the C-space in robot motion planning. The terrain geometry used for generating the CG position of rover is obtained using a Microsoft Kinect V2. A multivariable optimization process is used to extract the CG locus data of the rover as a discrete point cloud to generate CG space. Then using RRT* algorithm, the feasible path to reach a goal location from an initial point avoiding obstacles has been found out. During the motion planning for 10 DOF rover, RRT∗ algorithm directly samples a node from the CG locus data. It searches globally for an optimal path via two optimizing features in the extend function. Simulations on different types of terrains with different obstacle shapes show the usefulness of the method.",60021988,Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,Kanpur,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.666666666666668,0.037094155844155846,0.34760551948051943,1

Even if the generated trajectory is known to be safe in the planning phase, unknown disturbance during an actual operation can lead to a dangerous situation. This paper proposes safety-guaranteed receding horizon planning against unknown, but bounded, disturbances. We first characterize forward reachable set (FRS) of the system, the set of states after a certain duration considering all possible disturbances, using Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. To compute the FRSs in real-time, we conservatively approximate the true FRS and perform ellipsoidal parameterization on the FRSs. Using the FRSs, we can plan a robust trajectory that avoids risky regions and rapidly re-plan the trajectory when the system encounters sudden disturbance.

1940,1940,A skewed multi-banked cache for many-core vector processors,"As the number of cores and the memory bandwidth have increased in a balanced fashion, modern vector processors achieve high sustained performances, especially in memory-intensive applications in the fields of science and engineering. However, it is difficult to significantly increase the off-chip memory bandwidth owing to the limitation of the number of input/output pins integrated on a single chip. Under the circumstances, modern vector processors have adopted a shared cache to realize a high sustained memory bandwidth. The shared cache can effectively reduce the pressure to the off-chip memory bandwidth by keeping reusable data that multiple vector cores require. However, as the number of vector cores sharing a cache increases, more different blocks requested from multiple cores simultaneously use the same set. As a result, conflict misses caused by these blocks degrade the performance. In order to avoid increasing the conflict misses in the case of the increasing number of cores, this paper proposes a skewed cache for many-core vector processors. The skewed cache prevents the simultaneously requested blocks from being stored into the same set. This paper discusses how the most important two features of the skewed cache should be implemented in modern vector processors: hashing function and replacement policy. The proposed cache adopts the oddmultiplier displacement hashing for effective skewing and the static re-reference interval prediction policy for reasonable replacing. The evaluation results show that the proposed cache significantly improves the performance of a many-core vector processor by eliminating conflict misses.",60008435,Tohoku University,Sendai,Japan,"['1712', '1710', '1708', '1706', '1705', '1703']",22.09090909090909,0.19993506493506494,0.5406493506493507,1

1960,1960,Automatic Joint Calibration of odometry and sensor parameters," Publication rights licensed to ACM.Robotic calibration allows for the fusion of data from multiple sensors such as odometers, cameras, and lidars by providing appropriate transformational relationships between the corresponding reference frames. For wheeled robots equipped with exteroceptive sensors, calibration entails learning the motion model of the sensor or the robot in terms of the odometric data, and must generally be performed prior to performing tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Within this context, the current trend is to carry out simultaneous calibration of odometry and sensor without the use of any additional hardware. Building upon the existing simultaneous calibration algorithms, we put forth a robust joint calibration methodology using scan matching framework that can handle outliers due to non-systematic errors in an automated manner. Leveraging the alternating minimization technique, the proposed approach not only has superior performance as compared to the state-of-the-art methods but also does not require any manual trimming of outliers.

1964,1964,New calibration approach for 3D measurement system based on the light-source-stepping method,"In the 3D measurement system based on light-source-stepping method, phase shift changes with the depth of the object changes. The phase distribution recovered by N-step phase shifting method is distorted and then the recovered 3D shape is distorted. Fujigaki proposed the whole-space tabulation method to obtain 3D shape without distortion. The moving stage is used to calibrate the system and then the whole-space look-up tables are constructed. It is inconvenient to calibrate the measurement system. We proposed a new method to calibrate the system without moving stage. Firstly, the camera is calibrated by Zhang's method. Secondly, a reference plane with sparse marks is placed at different depth of measurement volume. The fringes are projected on the plane and the images are captured at the same time. Thirdly, the phase of different depth is worked out by improved Fourier transform profilometry method. The phase of marker is estimated by local curve fitting. The image coordinates of markers are detected. The projection matrix from reference plane to image plane is worked out from the image coordinates and world coordinates of markers and the inner parameters of camera. The 3D coordinates of every pixel of reference plane are worked out from their image coordinates and the projection matrix. Fourthly, a whole-space look-up table is constructed. This method does not need precise moving stage to calibrate the relationship between phase and 3D coordinates. The hardware requirement for system calibration is simplified.

The measurement error will not be amplified linearly with the synthetic wavelength, but controlled at the same level with the single wavelength interferometry.

Due to the dynamic nature of human activities, the evolving mobile technology has played a significant role and it is reflected in the exponential growth of the number of mobile users globally. However, the characteristic of the Internet as an open network made it vulnerable to various malicious activities. To secure communication at network layer, IETF recommended IPsec as a security feature. Mobile IPv6 as the successor of the current mobile technology, Mobile IPv4, also mandated the use of IPsec. However, since IPsec is a set of security algorithm, it has several well-known weaknesses such as bootstrapping issue when generating a security association as well as complex key exchange mechanism. It is a well-known fact that IPsec has a high overhead especially when implemented on Mobile IPv6 and used on limited energy devices such as mobile devices.

1996,1996,High-speed 3D shape measurement with the multi-view system using deep learning,"In this paper, we propose a high-speed three dimensional (3D) shape measurement with the multi-view system using deep learning. Common stereo matching methods are based on block-matching or graph cuts to build the global correspondence of stereo images and obtain the dense disparity map. For fringe projection profilometry (FPP), a large number of stereo matching algorithms have been proposed to enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency of stereo matching and acquire the disparity map with sub-pixel precision by using phase constraint, geometric constraint, and depth constraint. However, the universality and precision of these methods are still not enough which is difficult to meet high-precision and high-efficient 3D measurement applications. Inspired by deep learning techniques, we demonstrate that the deep neural networks can learn to perform stereo matching after appropriate training, which substantially improves the reliability and efficiency of stereo matching compared with the traditional approach. Besides, to acquire 3D results with high performance, the optimal design of the patterns projected by the projector is discussed in detail, and the relative spatial positions between the cameras and the projector are carefully adjusted in our multi-view system.

2009,2009,Classification of motor imagery and synchronization of post-stroke patient EEG signal," All rights reserved.Stroke attacks often cause disability, so the need for rehabilitation to restore patient's motor skills. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an instrument that can capture electrical activity in the brain. Some post-stroke patients have brain electrical dysfunction so that EEG signal can achieve such as amplitude decrease, and wave differences from symmetric channels. However, EEG signal analysis is not easy because it has high complexity and small amplitude. However, information from EEG signals is beneficial, including for stroke identification. This study proposes the identification of EEG signals from post-stroke patients using wavelet extraction and Backpropagation Levernberg-Marquardt. EEG signals are recorded, extracted imagery motor variables, and synchronization of symmetric channels. The results of the study provide that the accuracy for identifying post-stroke EEG signals is 100% for training data and 79.69 % for new data. Research also shows that the use of learning rates affects accuracy. The smaller the learning rate provided accuracy is better.

Our suggested method utilizes self common lines which induce identical lines within the Fourier transform of each projection-image. We show that the location of self common lines admits quite a few favorable geometrical constraints, thus allowing to detect them even in a noisy setting. In addition, for molecules with higher order rotational symmetry, our proposed method exploits the fact that there exist numerous common lines between any two Fourier transformed projection-images of such molecules, thus allowing to determine their relative orientation even under high levels of noise.

Different from the active SV systems in the literature where FPP is used to assist SV to address the issue of corresponding matching, a new system is proposed in this paper by constructing a fusion cost function with the consideration of both FPP and SV triangulations, so that the measurements of the two cameras can be fused to achieve better measurement performance than that of the active SV and FPP. In addition, a message passing algorithm for 3D shape reconstruction with the system is developed by using the new cost function and exploiting the unknown correlation of object surfaces.

2023,2023,Fringe projection profilometry for the 3D shape measurement of objects with three-dimensional movements,"Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is considered as an effective method for 3D shape measurement based on fringe projection. However, PSP is not suitable for dynamic measurement, as it requires that the object be kept still. Movement of the object during the cause of projection of multiple fringe patterns may lead to significant error in the measurement of the 3D shape. A number of approaches were proposed to combat this problem consisting of two steps: Capturing of the movement and then compensation (or correction) of fringe patterns. However, such compensation is only valid for the cases where the object moves or rotates in the way that all points on the object surface change by the same amount. In other words, there is still not a method effective for measuring objects moving in a free 3D space. In this paper, a new method is proposed to combat the problem. Firstly, movement of the object is capturing by means of existing methods, yielding rotation matrix and translation vector, able to characterize arbitrary movement in a 3D space. Secondly, variation of the fringe patterns by the movement is analyzed and formulated, leading to the expressions of phase maps. Based on these expressions, a new method is proposed to compensate the variance on height map, with which PSP can be used to yield improved measurement performance.

Here we propose a unified multi-task learning framework to jointly solve WSSS and SD using a single network, i.e. saliency and segmentation network (SSNet). SSNet consists of a segmentation network (SN) and a saliency aggregation module (SAM).

The proposed network is trained end-to-end with image-level category labels and class-agnostic pixel-level saliency labels.

Thus, the implementation of proper and innovative measures is a requisite for controlling pollution.

Siamese Similarity is a term that applies repetitive twin network architecture to machine learning for sentence similarity.

2038,2038,A new method for fringe order error correction in fringe projection profilometry,"Phase unwrapping is an essential step for 3D shape measurement based on fringe projection. Temporal phase unwrapping methods can be implemented by analyzing the multiple patterns that encode the fringe order information. They can retrieve the fringe orders on a pixel-by-pixel basis and are less prone to error propagation compared with spatial methods. However, fringe orders errors may still occur due to noise, reflectivity fluctuation and discontinuity of the object surface. Such errors may exhibit an impulsive nature and result in significant error to the recovered absolute phase map. This has been exploited by several methods to correct the fringe order errors, e.g., by filtering the fringe order sequences in a line-by-line manner. In this paper, a new method is proposed to correct the errors associated with fringe orders for the temporal phase unwrapping. The scheme first makes use of the low-rankness property of the fringe order map and sparse nature of the impulsive fringe order errors to more effectively remove the impulsive errors by applying robust principal component analysis (RPCA) algorithm. Then the smoothness of the two-dimensional unwrapped phase map is examined and the residual fringe order errors are detected based on a discontinuity measure of the phase map and corrected by comparing phase difference between two adjacent pixels in the unwrapped phase. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via numerical experiments.",60011664,University of Wollongong,Wollongong,Australia,['1706'],22.5,0.1284382284382284,0.4003496503496503,1

2042,2042,Low-power and high performance of an optimized FinFET based 8T SRAM cell design," All rights reserved.The development of the nanotechnology leads to the shrinking of the size of the transistors to nanometer region. However, there are a lot of challenges due to size scaling of the transistors such as short channel effects (SCEs) and threshold voltage roll-off issues. Fin-Type Field Effect Transistor (FinFET) is another alternative technology to solve the issues of the conventional MOSFET and increase the performance of the Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) circuit design. FinFET based SRAMs are faster and more reliable which are often used as memory cache for high speed operation. However, 6T SRAM cell suffers from access transistor sizing conflict resulting in a trade-off between read and write stability. This paper presents an investigation of the stability performance in retention, read and write mode of 22nm FinFET based 8T SRAM cell. The performance comparison of 22nm FinFET based 6T and 8T SRAMs were made. The simulation of the SRAM model are carried out in GTS Framework TCAD tool based on 22nm technology. In 8T SRAM cell, two n-FinFETs are added to the conventional 6T SRAM cell which will be controlled by the Read Word Line (RWL) to isolate the read and write operation path for better read stability. FinFET based 8T SRAM cell gives better performance in Static Noise Margin (SNM) and power consumption than 6T SRAM cells. The simulation results affirms the proposed FinFET based 8T SRAM improved read static noise margin by 166.67% and power consumption by 76.13% as compared to the FinFET based 6T SRAM.",60069385,Universitas Diponegoro,Semarang,Indonesia,"['1701', '1710']",23.0,0.11780612244897959,0.5592346938775511,0

The tracks are pushed onto the inner wall of the pipe by passive springs to maintain contact with the pipe during vertical climb and while turning in bends. The modules have the provision to compress asymmetrically, which enables the robot to take turns in bends in all directions. The motor torque required by the robot and the desired spring stiffness are calculated at quasi-static and static equilibriums during vertical climb.

2049,2049,Single-shot 3D shape measurement with spatial frequency multiplexing using deep learning,"In this paper, we propose a single-shot 3D shape measurement with spatial frequency multiplexing using deep learning. Fourier transform profilometry (FTP) is highly suitable for dynamic 3D acquisition and can provide the phase map using a single fringe pattern. However, it suffers from the spectrum overlapping problem which limits its measurement quality and precludes the recovery of the fine details of complex surfaces. Furthermore, FTP adopts the arctangent function ranging between-π and Π for phase calculation, which results in phase ambiguities in the wrapped phase map with 2π phase jumps. Inspired by deep learning techniques, in this study, we use a deep neural network to extract the phase information of the object from one deformed fringe pattern. Meanwhile, we design a dual-frequency fringe pattern with spatial frequency multiplexing to eliminate the phase ambiguities. Therefore, an absolute phase map can be obtained without projecting any additional patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that the single-shot 3D measurement method based on deep learning techniques can effectively realize the absolute 3D measurement with one fringe image and improve the measurement accuracy compared with the traditional Fourier transform profilometry.",60010080,Nanjing University of Science and Technology,Nanjing,China,['1706'],23.0,0.07301587301587302,0.5387301587301588,1

In this paper, we propose an insertion strategy that leverages tactile sensing to: 1) safely probe the box with the grasped object while monitoring incipient slip to maintain a stable grasp on the object. 2) estimate and correct for residual position uncertainties to insert the object into a designated gap without disturbing the environment.Our proposed methodology is based on two neural networks that estimate the error direction and error magnitude, from a stream of tactile imprints, acquired by two GelSlim fingers, during the insertion process. The system is trained on four objects with basic geometric shapes, which we show generalizes to four other common objects. Based on the estimated positional errors, a heuristic controller iteratively adjusts the position of the object and eventually inserts it successfully without requiring prior knowledge of the geometry of the object. The key insight is that dense tactile feedback contains useful information with respect to the contact interaction between the grasped object and its environment. We achieve high success rate and show that unknown objects can be inserted with an average of 6 attempts of the probe-correct loop.

2069,2069,On a novel inverse scattering scheme using resonant modes with enhanced imaging resolution,"We develop a novel wave imaging scheme for reconstructing the shape of an inhomogeneous scatterer and we consider the inverse acoustic obstacle scattering problem as a prototype model for our study. There exists a wealth of reconstruction methods for the inverse obstacle scattering problem and many of them intentionally avoid the interior resonant modes. Indeed, the occurrence of the interior resonance may cause the failure of the corresponding reconstruction. However, based on the observation that the interior resonant modes actually carry the geometrical information of the underlying obstacle, we propose an inverse scattering scheme of using those resonant modes for the reconstruction. To that end, we first develop a numerical procedure in determining the interior eigenvalues associated with an unknown obstacle from its far-field data based on the validity of the factorization method. Then we propose two efficient optimization methods in further determining the corresponding eigenfunctions. Using the afore-determined interior resonant modes, we show that the shape of the underlying obstacle can be effectively recovered. Moreover, the reconstruction yields enhanced imaging resolution, especially for the concave part of the obstacle. We provide rigorous theoretical justifications for the proposed method.

2074,2074,Temporal phase unwrapping using multi-scale deep neural networks,"The multi-frequency temporal phase unwrapping (MF-TPU) method, as a classical phase unwrapping algorithm for fringe projection profilometry (FPP), is capable of eliminating the phase ambiguities even in the presence of surface discontinuities or spatially isolated objects. For the simplest and most efficient case, two sets of 3-step phase-shifting fringe patterns are used: the high-frequency one is for 3D measurement and the unit-frequency one is for unwrapping the phase obtained from the high-frequency pattern set. The final measurement precision or sensitivity is determined by the number of fringes used within the high-frequency pattern, under the precondition that the phase can be successfully unwrapped without triggering the fringe order error. Consequently, in order to guarantee a reasonable unwrapping success rate, the fringe number (or period number) of the high-frequency fringe patterns is generally restricted to about 16, resulting in limited measurement accuracy. On the other hand, using additional intermediate sets of fringe patterns can unwrap the phase with higher frequency, but at the expense of a prolonged pattern sequence. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning techniques for computer vision and computational imaging, in this work, we report that the deep neural networks can learn to perform TPU after appropriate training, as called deep-learning based temporal phase unwrapping (DL-TPU), which can substantially improve the unwrapping reliability compared with MF-TPU. We further experimentally demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that the high-frequency phase obtained from 64-period 3-step phase-shifting fringe patterns can be directly and reliably unwrapped from one unit-frequency phase using DLTPU.

Furthermore, interactive music videos provide analytical challenges because no two viewings are identical. As such, by the introduction of the user, the traditional sound-image relationships cease to function. Analysing two interactive music videos, this essay has two aims. First, it shows how little it takes for music to be inadvertently muted in audiovisual analyses and then goes on to argue that musical analysis and musicological terminology can serve as a toolbox for amplifying sonic content and as such equalise it with the visual.

Both understanding and evaluating the mountains of collected stock data has become a challenge in relevant fields. Data visualisation techniques can offer a practical and engaging method to show the processed data in a meaningful way, with centrality measurements representing the significant variables in a network, through exploring the aspects of the exact definition of the metric. Here, in this study, we conducted an approach that combines data processing, graph visualisation and social network analysis methods, to develop deeper insights of complex stock data, with the ultimate aim of drawing the correct conclusions with the finalised graph models. We addressed the performance of centrality metrics methods such as betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, PageRank and weighted degree measurements, drawing comparisons between the experiments' results and the actual top 300 shares in the Australian Stock Market. The outcomes showed consistent results. Although, in our experiments, the results of the top 300 stocks from those five centrality measurements' rankings did not match the top 300 shares given by the ASX (Australian Securities Exchange) entirely, in which the weighted degree and PageRank metrics performed better than other three measurements such as betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. Potential reasons may include that we did not take into account the factor of stock's market capitalisation in the methodology.

Differential absorption spectroscopy requires a very complex super-definite equation to solve for concentration, which is easy to generate solution errors. Based on the traditional differential absorption algorithm, this paper uses genetic algorithm to invert low-concentration H2S gas, but the genetic algorithm is prone to premature convergence and thus falls into local optimum. A genetic algorithm based on catastrophe optimization is designed to retrieve H2S gas concentration. The use of catastrophic will significantly improve the ability of the algorithm to develop in the solution space. By preserving the local optimal solution obtained before the disaster, the algorithm can be avoided as a random search, which ensures the stability of the algorithm. The optimization of the differential absorption algorithm mainly includes data acquisition, data processing and data presentation. Data acquisition is the collection of changes that occur after gas molecules absorb photons. Data processing is based on the collected data and the optimization algorithm to calculate the optimal concentration. The data presentation is to display the calculated concentration on the computer. The concentration of H2S gas was inversed by the traditional DOAS algorithm and the optimized DOAS algorithm. The results were compared. The results show that the method has high measurement accuracy for low concentration H2S gas, and combines with traditional differential absorption spectroscopy to obtain a wider measurement range.",60025094,Hebei University of Science and Technology,Shijiazhuang,China,['1706'],19.46153846153846,0.08796428571428572,0.5210357142857143,1
2105,2105,A solid mechanics approach to robotic grasp analysis,"Wrench space formulations and grasp quality measures based on wrench space are widely used in robotics community to evaluate the stability of robotic grasps. However, many simplifying assumptions are used in this approach in order to make the analysis feasible. For example, both the object and the hand are assumed to be rigid and the contacts are represented by their resultant forces and moments (wrenches), as a result of which most of the grasps identified by them fail in experiments. In this work, we discuss the discrepancies present in the wrench space analysis due to these assumptions and propose a Finite Element (FE)-based grasp synthesis methodology, which evaluates the grasp stability based on the well-established foundations of deformable solid mechanics. Using a spring-mass-damper model, we demonstrate the versatility of our FE-framework in analyzing the stability of robotic grasps during external perturbation. By performing several FE simulations of grasping an object of different masses, squeeze displacements and friction coefficients, we then study the influence of physical characteristics of object on grasp stability during perturbation.

The corresponding first-order necessary optimality system is discretized in a one-shot manner by a second-order finite difference scheme in space and time. The proposed optimal control setting, as discussed in the paper, provides more general framework in terms of solving this type of ill-posed inverse problem. In particular, several existing nonlocal quasi-boundary value methods appear to be the special cases of our proposed optimal control framework with appropriately chosen generalized regularization setting respectively. The relationship between our Tikhonov regularization approach and the quasi-boundary value methods is discussed in detail.

Its curing extent and thickness are the key factors, determining its protection performance. At present, the traditional method to evaluate the curing extent is metallographic section, which cuts PCB and images its cross-section under a microscope. However, it is destructive. In this study, we proposed to use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to evaluate the coating curing extent. Note that Brownian motion inside the conformal coating gets slower during curing process, leading to a smaller OCT intensity variation over time. Therefore, speckle variance (SV) of OCT imaging, which actually measures the OCT intensity variation, is expected to become smaller during the curing process and can be used to evaluate the curing extent over the whole imaging depth. To demonstrate the capability of SVOCT in detecting the curing extent of conformal coating, multiple OCT images were acquired at each curing status for SV calculation. The results show that the speckle variance of OCT image will gradually decrease during the curing process of conformal coating and eventually stabilize after the coating cures completely. This can be utilized to assess the curing extent of the conformal coating.",60010432,Soochow University,Suzhou,China,['1706'],20.2,-0.05384615384615385,0.4423076923076924,1

2121,2121,A comparative study of robots in laparoscopic surgeries,"Robots have been used in industry for several decades. Their use in medicine is relatively more recent, starting from the late 1980s. Today, robotic surgical systems are used in urology, gynecology, cardiology, general surgery, and other medical specialties. Robot systems such as Da Vinci and ZEUS have helped accelerate and expand the boundaries of minimally invasive surgery. This has led to more complex yet safer procedures (compared to conventional laparoscopy) through better visualization, improved dexterity, and hand tremor filtering. These systems also provide improved hand-eye coordination and ergonomics resulting in reduced physical stress to the surgeons. This paper is emphasized on providing a review of the different robotic surgical systems. A detailed comparison of the most commonly used systems, as well as their applications and cost implications, are discussed in the paper.",60014153,"Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay",Mumbai,India,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",16.5,0.0467687074829932,0.3845238095238095,1

Medical equipment functioned as uterine is required, so the infant will have the similar condition as in the womb of its mother. There is a need to control surrounding temperature, humidity, oxygen supply, sound and light level to support the development of the infant's weight. Infants with low weight have possibility to feel cold and have body heat loss. The use of additional supporting equipment such as incubator is absolutely necessary and vital to create a stable surrounding environment for infant to keep the body temperature in range of normal and relatively constant value. In this paper, the fuzzy logic is implemented as the role of controller for an incubator equipped with temperature and humidity sensor. The propossed incubator prototype was tested in DR.
