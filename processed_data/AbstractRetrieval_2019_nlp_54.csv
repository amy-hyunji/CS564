0,0,Does defence expenditure crowd out human capital expenditure? An empirical investigation in south asia,"Military expenditure and human capital expenditure are important components of central government expenditure. It has been accepted that high and increasing military expenditure may crowd out resources from human development expenditure, as the sources of government revenue are limited. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between military expenditure and, education and health expenditure in conflict affected five countries in South Asia, namely, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka from the period 1980 to 2014, by applying the ARDL bounds test approach to cointegration and VECM Granger causality method. The finding of this study shows a significant negative effect of military expenditure on both health and education expenditure in several countries in South Asia. Moreover, it also provides an evidence for Granger causality in the long-run and in the short-run in most of the countries in South Asia. In addition, the findings of this study serve as a guide to the government and the policy-makers should take rigorous steps to minimize military expenditure through preventing conflict and enhancing good governance, which eventually enhance investment in human development.",60002763,Universiti Utara Malaysia,Sintok,Malaysia,['1700'],30.166666666666668,0.07432773109243698,0.30046218487394954,1
1,1,Influence of process and technology factors in successful implementation of CRM in private sector banks,"The Banking Industry in India has undergone a rapid changes followed by a series of fundamental developments. In the present Indian Banking Scenario, The Influence of Processes and technology has revolutionized banking services and practices. Observation on the recent restructuring, rebranding and reengineering efforts of many banks, states that the key motive is to utilize customer centricity as a strategy. Most of the Banks have invested in technology enabled Customer Relationship Management Software to utilize Customer information for enhancing business opportunities and access to customer support. Customer Relationship Management has become inevitable for growth and profitability of Banks in present scenario marked by rising competition, technological advancement and empowered customers. The CRM practices are adopted to generate better understanding of the customer for product development, segmentation, appropriate targeting, campaign management and maintenance of long term profitable and mutually beneficial relationships with customers.

3,3,A systematic computerized training program for using Sensory Substitution Devices in real-life,"In the past decades, Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs) have been widely used as a research tool to unravel the properties of the sensory brain. Although their rehabilitation potential is repeatedly demonstrated, SSDs were never widely adopted by blind individuals in everyday life, except for a few super-users' cases. One reason explaining this gap is the lack of structured SSD training programs for everyday use. We thus developed an ambitious computerized SSD training program using the EyeMusic visual-to-auditory SSD and gathered 10 blind participants to test its efficiency. Participants were trained to identify pictures of real objects from different categories (e.g., furniture). For each category, we tested the performance of participants before training and again after 10 hours of dedicated training. The test included both trained and untrained stimuli. The 10 hours training program involved a combination of static stimuli and dynamic computer games and was individually adapted to participants' learning pace. Initial results show that after training, participants achieved significantly higher accuracy rates in object recognition compared to baseline for trained and most importantly, for untrained objects from the same category. This further supports the suitability of SSDs in everyday life, and thus propels their adoption for this purpose.",60007903,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Jerusalem,Israel,['1705'],19.9,0.004347826086956528,0.4923913043478261,1

However, when developing tools for rehabilitation, it is essential to design interventions that will be most effective for generalizing to the real world. Therefore, it is important to understand what factors facilitate transfer from HMD-VR to non-HMD-VR environments. Here we used a well-established test of skilled motor learning, the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT), to train healthy individuals in an HMD-VR environment. We examined whether learned motor skills transferred to a more conventional (non-HMD-VR) environment and what factors facilitated transfer. Our results suggest that on average, learned motor skills from this task transfer from an immersive virtual environment to a conventional environment; however, some individuals did not transfer the learned motor skills. We then examined individual differences between those that did show transfer and those that did not. We found that individuals who had previous exposure to HMD-VR were more likely to transfer their learned motor skills than those who did not. Individual differences in previous exposure to HMD-VR environments prior to training may serve as a predictor to whether learned motor skills will transfer out of HMD-VR.",60029311,University of Southern California,Los Angeles,United States,['1705'],21.666666666666668,0.15385487528344674,0.4356009070294785,1

21,21,Observation of an expert model induces a coarticulated drawing movement pattern in a single session,"We tested how observation of a skilled pattern of planar movements can assist in the learning of a new motor skill, which otherwise requires rigorous long-term practice to achieve fast and smooth performance. Sixty participants performed a sequence of planar hand movements on pre-test, acquisition, post-test and 24h post-training blocks, under 1 of 4 conditions: an observation group (OG), a slowed observation group (SOG), a random motion control group (RMCG) and a double physical training control group (DPTCG). The OG and SOG observed a co-aligned expert model's right hand performing the study task intermittently throughout acquisition, RMCG observed random dots movement instead of a model. Participants in the DPTCG received extra physical practice trials instead of the visually observed trials. Kinematic analysis revealed that only in conditions with observation of an expert model there was an instant robust improvement in motor planning of the task. This step-wise improvement was not only persistent in post-training retests but was also apparently implicit and subject to further incremental improvements in movement strategy over the period of 24 hours. We suggest that observation of hand movements of an expert model coaligned with self-produced movements during training can significantly condense the time-course of ecologically relevant drawing / writing skill mastery.

The MST problems with deterministic edge costs have been worked intensively and the MST of a connected weighted graph can be determined using many efficient algorithms introduced by outstanding scientists. However, in real life scenarios, several types of uncertainties are generally encountered, because of insufficient information, imperfect information, failure or other reasons. In this paper, we concentrate on a MST problem of a undirected connected fuzzy graph in which a intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, instead of a crisp (real) number, is used to each edge as edge weight. We define this problem as intuitionistic minimum spanning tree (IMST) problem. We introduce an algorithmic approach for designing the IMST of a fuzzy. The Borůvka’s algorithm is a popular greedy algorithm for designing a MST in a graph. Here, we have modified the classical Borůvka’s algorithm to generate the IMST of fuzzy graph.

Professional knowledge is an important domain characterising an ideal teacher. This domain aims at ensuring prospective English Foreign Language (EFL) teachers to understand learner characteristics and to have pedagogical knowledge to act on those understandings in diverse contexts. It captures the elements of understanding students and how they learn. This paper is the result of a Carspecken critical ethnography study. Globalization theory by Appadurai is applied in this study to explain the presence of the homogeneity of the professional knowledge domain across policies. Following Appadurai [1] this study argues a strong degree of homogeneity across global education policy, Indonesian national teacher education policy and local institutional policy in Central Java, identifying an alignment across the policy documents on what constitutes quality prospective EFL teachers. Evidence of homogeneity suggests accepted values across borders from global to national to local contexts. Therefore, this paper provides meaningful insights towards the discussion of professional knowledge that influences the formation of quality EFL teachers not only locally and nationally but also in the broader context of teacher preparation globally.",100640250,Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta,Surakarta,Indonesia,['1700'],21.666666666666668,0.11401515151515151,0.26856060606060606,1
26,26,The Effectiveness of Rest-Pause Method Vs Traditional Training Method on Muscle Power Development among Badminton Players,"Background and Objectives: Muscle builders have been seeking many training variations to avoid muscular adaptation in building strength, endurance, power, and more aesthetically muscle bulk or muscle mass. Recently, a new set configuration of training program had been introduced which the rest-pause method or cluster is set as an alternate way to list in training variation. The purpose of this study is to identify the power gains in local isolation muscle training through rest-pause method and traditional method. Hence, the aims of this study are: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of rest-pause method on local muscle power among recreational badminton players in a total of 4 weeks. (2) to compare the effectiveness of rest-pause method vs traditional training method on local muscle power among recreational badminton players. Methods: A randomised controlled trial was carried out for 4 weeks to examine the effects of rest-pause method on muscle power development among badminton players. Total of 32 subjects were recruited through convenient sampling method. Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups: experimental group (RP) and control group (TR). Subjects were asked to perform barbell hip thrust with different training method according to the group they were assigned. A pre-test and post-test local muscle power were measured for both groups using vertical jump test. Results: After 4 weeks of training, there is significant difference in pre-test and post-test jump height and peak power output of gluteal muscle in both RP and TR training groups. However, there is non-significant difference in post-test jump height (p=0.341) and peak power output (p=0.441) between two groups. Conclusions: In conclusion, rest-pause method and traditional method had significantly improved the jump performance and also the peak power output of gluteal musculature among badminton players. People who seek for training variation can choose either one of it, but since rest-pause method had a higher mean difference; it would more likely recommend using rest-pause method for muscle power development.",60090708,Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman,Kajang,Malaysia,['1700'],22.714285714285715,0.05103754940711462,0.5279150197628458,1

While sharing the spectrum among the users interference problem may arise. In this paper we are discussing about the problem in primary user while estimating the senseless area which means that the secondary user may uses the primary user spectrum without consider whether primary user is transmitting or not. In our proposed work we discuss the boundary estimated algorithm. This algorithm may determine the boundary of primary user and secondary users to utilize the spectrum in efficient way. By using boundary estimated algorithm the secondary users will measures the boundary of no-talk area. The boundary is calculated by secondary users by transfers the message among them and measuring the trade-off in estimation error, examines throughput and communication cost, arrangement complexity and robustness. This algorithm helps to improve the communication tradeoff value and estimation performance value. The performance estimation value by using boundary estimated algorithm is better than other algorithms. Error in spectrum sensing is minimized by using this technique.

When natural image is processed, the results are obtained as per the application of algorithm. When comparing the result of natural image and processed image, the result is such that the processed image provides better results. The orientation of the proposed algorithm is to retrieve the age from the given input image. The classification of the age is done with the aid of fractal segmentation based algorithm. When the result obtained is compared with various images of diversified quality, the inference is obtained as different images need different filters for processing and to extract the features from it. In this paper the merits of different filters for processing images of different quality is discussed. In processing the facial images, application of uniform filter for images of different quality does not provide accurate results. So based on the quality of image, the appropriate filter is applied.

32,32,The politics of assimilation of the tea-garden community of assam with the greater assamese society,"Tea garden community of Assam has been playing an important role in shaping the political milieu of Assam. Tea garden workers of Assam has a history of millions of colonial migrant workers, who has worked under the condition of indentured servitude in tea plantation in Assam, producing tea for an increasingly profitable global market. Ever since the colonial period the socio economic condition of tea garden workers has hardly improved even today. Based on these inferior conditions of tea plantation workers, they are called the ‘Subalterns’. In spite of their contributions to the growth of tea plantation in Assam, their socioeconomic condition depicts the legacy of exploitation since pre independence. Migrant labours that were brought to Assam from different parts of India and were settled across the plantation areas constituted the very core of the tea plantation in Assam. In Assam they are known by different nomenclatures such as Cooley, Bongali, Bagania, Chah Shramik etc in colonial period, again as Tea community, Tea tribes, Adivasis, Ex-tea garden labour community etc in present times. But the fact remained that each member of the tea and ex-tea garden community primarily is a member of an ethnic, religious and socio cultural group. As these tea garden workers originated from different ethnic background, they had to make a tough struggle for adjustment in a completely new environment and in the process of adjusting with the situation some major transformation were observed in their life. Therefore in this context the present paper is an attempt to understand the politics of assimilation of tea garden community of Assam with that of the larger Assamese community and the paper also highlights that during the course of the assimilation process there is the revival of the Adivasi identity which has been observed among the tea garden community of Assam.",60013389,Dibrugarh University,Dibrugarh,India,['1700'],30.1,0.043068846358320055,0.3989234449760765,1

Owing to the generation of substantial-sized data, Hadoop has become a defacto standard to handle it. Hadoop has a computation engine termed MapReduce to process this data. One important issue in MapReduce is how to identify and address the performance deterioration in slow running tasks. This deterioration is handled automatically by scheduling slow task on another node which has an empty slot. However, this might not improve performance as backed up tasks are launched on nodes anonymously without knowing their computational details. In this paper we discuss an approach on handling speculated tasks by scheduling it on nodes that have performed better by profiling the set of nodes in the cluster and improving the network resources by prioritizing the corresponding set of flow entries of nodes with the help of SDN. Further care is taken to schedule tasks which have data skew.

This study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the relationship between Klebsiella spp. isolated from clinical and environmental samples in Iraq. Fifty Klebsiella spp. isolates were isolated from clinical and environmental sources. Twenty-five isolates were collected from a fresh vegetable (Apium graveolens) and 25 from clinical samples (sputum, wound swab, urine). Enteric bacteria were isolated on selective and differential media and identified by an automatic identification system, vitek-2. The total DNA was extracted and PCR amplified for selected isolates. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by using the universal primer 27F (5'- AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG- 3') and 1492R (5'-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT- 3'). The 16SrRNA gene sequence was analysed among some local isolates, and the results were compared with the standard data of similar registered strains in NCBI. The most common species of Klebsiella was Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumoniae (Kpp), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae ozaenae (Kpo) and Klebsiella oxytoca (Ko).

47,47,Standardizing Visual Rehabilitation using Simple Virtual Tests,"Many different visual rehabilitation approaches are being utilized to offer visual information to the blind. User proficiency and functional ability are currently evaluated either via ad-hoc tests or via standardized visual tests which are not sensitive enough in the range of extreme low vision. Unfortunately, this is the functional level that these approaches typically offer. This is especially important as the main criteria by which most users will judge the efficacy of these rehabilitation approaches is by the functional benefits it grants them. Furthermore, currently, there are no accepted benchmarks or clear comparative testing of each rehabilitation approach, leading to the development of many new aids but the practical adoption of few. Combined these indicate a need to add standardized functional tests to this evaluation toolbox. Indeed, several functional tests have recently been suggested but their adoption has been very limited. Here, we review current tests and then conduct a formative study consulting experts in the field to map issues with current standardization attempts. This formative study offered a list of practical design suggestions for functional standardization tests. We then suggest using simple virtual environments as one such family of tests. Virtual scenarios meet many of the experts' suggestions - they are easy to share, flexible, affordable, safe, identical wherever run, can be run by a single operator and offer control over external parameters enabling a focus on the offered visual information. Finally, we demonstrate this approach via a freely available virtual version of a relatively standard functional test - finding a door - in a 10-minute paradigm which includes 30 trials.

48,48,A coefficient density adaptive quantization approach for lossless color image compression,"Lossless color image compression is considered to be the efficient compression scheme as it primarily preserves the image sharpness without the loss of vital elements. In our previous works, we have introduced MHPCA for encoding the chrominance images Cu and Cv and MHPBLI for encoding the luminance channel Y. Then the Context adaptive arithmetic coding is applied to achieve efficient lossless image compression. In the MHPBLI coding scheme, a division of 8×8 non overlapping blocks is made in the luminance channel Y. After that blocks are classified into black, white and gray blocks and then are quantized and encoded. The performance of this approach can further be improved by applying a suitable transform to the blocks before quantization. In this paper, Coefficient Density Adaptive Quantization (CDAQ) approach is introduced to improve the image quantization for achieving lossless color image compression. In this work, the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied to improve the performance of image compression performance. For efficient division of the image into 8×8 chunks, DCT is applied in JPEG-LS based compression schemes. Then the blocks are categorized and the density functions of DCT coefficients for the gray and black blocks are determined globally and also locally from which the magnitude of each DCT coefficient is determined. By determining the magnitude of the density of coefficients, the images are adaptively quantized which preserves the quality of the image pixels. Result of the CDAQ shows that it provides better performance than earlier works and can enhance the image compression efficiency.",60114470,Erode Arts and Science College,Erode,India,['1700'],20.916666666666668,0.08750000000000002,0.34861111111111115,1

59,59,A framework for fuzzy-based fault tolerant routing mechanism with capacity delay tradeoff in MANET,"A very efficient and well-known computing environment is Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) since it is simple for installation. The reliability and link stability for transmitting the packets is needed in MANET to achieve Quality of Service (QoS) support in terms of available bandwidth, high throughput and stable jitter. Hence, QoS aware metric for routing is incorporated with the Correlated Mobility (CM). In this method, Link Stability Factor(LSF) is estimated by considering received signal strength, the appropriate contention count and hop count. On the basis of the estimated LSF, stable link is determined. After that, the node with the highest LSF is elected as a reliable forwarding node. But, neighbor nodes were required to be detected within low-bounded time interval for improving the link stability and forward node selection. And also the uncertainty issues in the consideration of multiple network metrics such as delay, bandwidth, Link Stability Factor and residual energy are to be solved. Here, the fuzzy logic method is used to convert the considered network metrics as a single metric called fuzzy cost or communication cost. Then, the path with minimum fuzzy cost is selected as an optimal route to transmit the data from the source to the destination node in the network with reduced delay. However, the node capacity and delay are affected during data transmission due to its mobility. Multi-criteria Enhanced Optimal Capacity-Delay Tradeoff with Efficient Fuzzy-based Multi-constraint Multicast Routing (MEOCDTEFM2R) method efficiently handles the transmission failure in the network. In this method, the Cluster Head (CH) for each cluster is chosen depending upon on the maximum nodal weight which is stored in the routing table. Initially, each and every node computes its weight with different network metrics like residual energy, mobility speed, computational power and fault tolerance. Finally, the simulation gives the evidence for the performance effectiveness of the MEOCDT-EFM2FTR method for throughput, routing overhead, delay, etc.",116399711,Periyar E.V.R College,Tiruchirappalli,India,['1700'],20.733333333333334,0.0712074829931973,0.38117346938775504,1

Five hybrid genotypes of barley were tested under drought and irrigated conditions to detect the flag-leaf specific weight, chlorophyll content index (SPAD; The Soil Plant Analysis Development chlorophyll meter) and the period from anthesis to physiological maturity. Across both years 2016-17 and 2017-18, there was no effect of drought on flag-leaf specific weight, however, SPAD was reduced by 4.77 and the period between anthesis and maturity was shortened by almost two days. Genotype 3//14 scored the highest values of flag-leaf specific weight (7.765 mg cm-2)and SPAD (25.56), and stayed green for the longest period (28.69 days) (P=0.05), showing its ability to be more tolerant to moisture reductionas compared to the other tested genotypes. In order to explain the physiological mechanisms among the assessed traits under both irrigated and drought conditions, linear regression analysis was applied for both seasons and averaged over seasons. A positive linear relationship was shownbetween flag-leaf specific weight and SPAD under both irrigated (R2=0.83; P=0.03) and drought (R2=0.76; P=0.05) conditions, explaining the high flag-leaf chlorophyll content resulting from high specific weight of leaves. The high flag-leaf specific weight was also associated with longer periods for leaves to stay-green after anthesis, under both irrigated (R2=0.91; P=0.01) and drought (R2=0.79; P=0.04) conditions, which provides a great chance to accumulate more resources of carbohydrates and protein in the grain and, consequently,a higher throughput of yield.",60118438,Sulaimani Polytechnic University,Sulaymaniyah,Iraq,['1700'],35.57142857142857,0.14307486631016045,0.3494385026737968,0

68,68,Influencing the mind of the consumers: The role of the law and the regulators in controlling credit advertisement,"Advertising boosts market performance by offering useful information to consumers. It enables firms to promote the attributes of their products and services and, thereby, to compete better with each other. On the other hand, advertising may adversely affect market performance when businesses use it to transmit deceptive or fraudulent messages on which reasonable consumers are induced to rely to their detriment. Regulatory intervention is prerequisite to circumvent those promotional efforts by firms that convey untruthful and misleading information to consumers. This study examines the principal laws and regulators involved in governing consumer credit advertisement in Malaysia. The scope is limited to four major areas namely banking, hire-purchase, moneylending and pawnbroking. The piecemeal approach in regulating this industry results in different provisions are in place to regulate consumer credit advertisement by different regulators. As a consequence, prospective consumers of various credit products are subject to different levels of protection which may be greater or lower than the other. Thus, some of them may become the victim of unethical and profit-oriented credit providers who unfairly enticing consumers to close the deal relying on misleading advertisement.

89,89,Dense 3D Reconstruction for Visual Tunnel Inspection using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) opens venues for application such as tunnel inspection. Owing to its versatility to fly inside the tunnels, it can quickly identify defects and potential problems related to safety. However, long tunnels, especially with repetitive or uniform structures pose a significant problem for UAV navigation. Furthermore, post-processing visual data from the camera mounted on the UAV is required to generate useful information for the inspection task. In this work, we design a UAV with a single rotating camera to accomplish the task. Compared to other platforms, our solution can fit the stringent requirement for tunnel inspection, in terms of battery life, size and weight. While the current state-of-the-art can estimate camera pose and 3D geometry from a sequence of images, they assume large overlap, small rotational motion, and many distinct matching points between images. These assumptions severely limit their effectiveness in tunnel-like scenarios where the camera has erratic or large rotational motion, such as the one mounted on the UAV. This paper presents a novel solution which exploits Structure-from-Motion, Bundle Adjustment, and available geometry priors to robustly estimate camera pose and automatically reconstruct a fully-dense 3D scene using the least possible number of images in various challenging tunnel-like environments. We validate our system with both Virtual Reality application and experimentation with a real dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction along with texture mapping allows for remote navigation and inspection of tunnel-like environments, even those which are inaccessible for humans.",60005510,Nanyang Technological University,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",22.363636363636363,0.12108843537414968,0.48469387755102045,1

This paper proposes such an embedding scheme for color sensors in the JPEG domain, extending thus the prior art proposed for the pixel domain and the JPEG domain for monochrome sensors. We first show that color sensors generate strong intra-block and inter-block dependencies between DCT coefficients and that theses dependencies are due to the demosaicking step in the development process. Capturing theses dependencies using an empirical covariance matrix, we propose a pseudo-embedding algorithm on greyscale JPEG images which uses up to four sub-lattices and 64 lattices to embed information while preserving the estimated correlations among DCT coefficients. We then compute an approximation of the average embedding rate w.r.t. the JPEG quality factor and evaluate the empirical security of the proposed scheme for linear and non-linear demosaicing schemes. Our experiments show that we can achieve high capacity (around 2 bit per nzAC) with a high empirical security (PE ≈ 30% using DCTR at QF 95).",60104665,University of Lille,Lille,France,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",26.714285714285715,0.0641117216117216,0.35594322344322343,1

In contrast to previous methods that predict 3D poses independently of the focal length or assume a constant focal length, we explicitly estimate and integrate the focal length into the 3D pose estimation. For this purpose, we combine deep learning techniques and geometric algorithms in a two-stage approach: First, we estimate an initial focal length and establish 2D-3D correspondences from a single RGB image using a deep network. Second, we recover 3D poses and refine the focal length by minimizing the reprojection error of the predicted correspondences. In this way, we exploit the geometric prior given by the focal length for 3D pose estimation. This results in two advantages: First, we achieve significantly improved 3D translation and 3D pose accuracy compared to existing methods. Second, our approach finds a geometric consensus between the individual projection parameters, which is required for precise 2D-3D alignment.

Although existing editors and IDEs support the identification of syntax errors, their functions for detecting logical errors in compilable program code are very limited. Algorithms have been developed taking either a static code analysis approach or a deep learning approach. However, although overall experimental results are positive in terms of the detection of logic errors, the results have limitations. We should take advantage of algorithm capacity as well as avoidance of mismatches caused by weakness in implementing the corresponding intelligent coding editors.

Moreover, today's pulsed lidar scanners suffer from high cost, power consumption, large form-factors, and they fail in the presence of strong backscatter. We depart from point scanning and demonstrate that it is possible to turn a low-cost CMOS gated imager into a dense depth camera with at least 80m range - by learning depth from three gated images. The proposed architecture exploits semantic context across gated slices, and is trained on a synthetic discriminator loss without the need of dense depth labels. The proposed replacement for scanning lidar systems is real-time, handles back-scatter and provides dense depth at long ranges.

98,98,Hierarchy parsing for image captioning,"It is always well believed that parsing an image into constituent visual patterns would be helpful for understanding and representing an image. Nevertheless, there has not been evidence in support of the idea on describing an image with a natural-language utterance. In this paper, we introduce a new design to model a hierarchy from instance level (segmentation), region level (detection) to the whole image to delve into a thorough image understanding for captioning. Specifically, we present a HIerarchy Parsing (HIP) architecture that novelly integrates hierarchical structure into image encoder. Technically, an image decomposes into a set of regions and some of the regions are resolved into finer ones. Each region then regresses to an instance, i.e., foreground of the region. Such process naturally builds a hierarchal tree. A tree-structured Long Short-Term Memory (Tree-LSTM) network is then employed to interpret the hierarchal structure and enhance all the instance-level, region-level and image-level features. Our HIP is appealing in view that it is pluggable to any neural captioning models. Extensive experiments on COCO image captioning dataset demonstrate the superiority of HIP. More remarkably, HIP plus a top-down attention-based LSTM decoder increases CIDEr-D performance from 120.1% to 127.2% on COCO Karpathy test split. When further endowing instance-level and region-level features from HIP with semantic relation learnt through Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), CIDEr-D is boosted up to 130.6%.",120499086,JD AI Research,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1707']",18.583333333333332,0.16433566433566435,0.37214452214452215,1

Specifically, a smartphone-based AR application is developed that allows a user to select any location within the robot's workspace by merely touching on the smartphone screen. Virtual objects, rendered at user-selected locations, are used to determine the pick and place locations of objects in the real world. The virtual object's start and end points, originally specified in the smartphone camera coordinate frame, are transformed into the robot coordinate frame for the robot manipulator to autonomously perform the assigned task.

To address this issue, a dataset with highly interactive vehicle motions is constructed in this paper. A variety of challenging driving scenarios such as unsignalized intersections and roundabouts are included. Reference paths are also constructed from motion data along with high-definition maps so that key features can be generated for both prediction and planning algorithms. Moreover, we propose a set of metrics to extract the interactive motions in different maps, including the minimum difference of time to collision point (MDTTC) and duration of waiting period. Such metrics are used to quantity the interaction density of the dataset. We also give several representative results on prediction and motion generation utilizing the constructed dataset to demonstrate how the dataset can facilitate research in the area of driving behavior.",60025038,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,United States,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",20.7,0.12796296296296295,0.42018518518518516,1
103,103,Driving with Style: Inverse Reinforcement Learning in General-Purpose Planning for Automated Driving,"Behavior and motion planning play an important role in automated driving. Traditionally, behavior planners instruct local motion planners with predefined behaviors. Due to the high scene complexity in urban environments, unpredictable situations may occur in which behavior planners fail to match predefined behavior templates. Recently, general-purpose planners have been introduced, combining behavior and local motion planning. These general-purpose planners allow behavior-aware motion planning given a single reward function. However, two challenges arise: First, this function has to map a complex feature space into rewards. Second, the reward function has to be manually tuned by an expert. Manually tuning this reward function becomes a tedious task. In this paper, we propose an approach that relies on human driving demonstrations to automatically tune reward functions. This study offers important insights into the driving style optimization of general-purpose planners with maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach based on the expected value difference between learned and demonstrated policies. Furthermore, we compare the similarity of human driven trajectories with optimal policies of our planner under learned and expert-tuned reward functions. Our experiments show that we are able to learn reward functions exceeding the level of manual expert tuning without prior domain knowledge.",60020755,Volkswagen AG,Wolfsburg,Germany,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",15.384615384615385,0.0021320346320346417,0.38125541125541124,1

Through an innovative application of traditional signal-processing theory and methods, this paper extends the understanding of interference effects in a stretch processor by deriving an expression for the stretch processor's exact response to a deterministic monochromatic signal.

105,105,Sample Efficient Interactive End-to-End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars with Selective Multi-Class Safe Dataset Aggregation,"The objective of this paper is to develop a sample efficient end-to-end deep learning method for self-driving cars, where we attempt to increase the value of the information extracted from samples, through careful analysis obtained from each call to expert driver's policy. End-to-end imitation learning is a popular method for computing self-driving car policies. The standard approach relies on collecting pairs of inputs (camera images) and outputs (steering angle, etc.) from an expert policy and fitting a deep neural network to this data to learn the driving policy. Although this approach had some successful demonstrations in the past, learning a good policy might require a lot of samples from the expert driver, which might be resource-consuming. In this work, we develop a novel framework based on the Safe Dataset Aggregation (safe DAgger) approach, where the current learned policy is automatically segmented into different trajectory classes, and the algorithm identifies trajectory segments/classes with the weak performance at each step. Once the trajectory segments with weak performance identified, the sampling algorithm focuses on calling the expert policy only on these segments, which improves the convergence rate. The presented simulation results show that the proposed approach can yield significantly better performance compared to the standard Safe DAgger algorithm while using the same amount of samples from the expert.",60022002,Istanbul Teknik Üniversitesi,Istanbul,Turkey,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",30.714285714285715,0.15075757575757576,0.47613636363636364,1

This project's goal is to develop a way of using blockchain technology to share transaction information among different power grids in a secure, controlled, monitored, and efficient manner. The biggest concern regarding the data is integrity. By leveraging blockchain technology, the data will be reliable and resilient to attacks, such as man-in-the-middle and data spoofing attacks. The Hyperledger Fabric implementation provides a permissioned network in which power grids will act as nodes that maintain ledger information. By using a distributed ledger to validate transactions though the process of consensus, the system can share information in a manner that is more secure and transparent than traditional information sharing systems in which data is less secure and takes longer to validate.

High-Definition maps are a popular method to represent the environment and to enable precise localization. However, the creation is very demanding and it is not always guaranteed to receive accurate map information, especially for unstructured areas. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic localization and mapping framework that brings together the advantages of sparse feature maps, multi-target tracking for landmark detection, probabilistic global vehicle localization and a graph-based formulation to achieve a consistent map. The front-end of our Simultaneous Localization and Mapping framework is based on Monte Carlo Localization. Our novel measurement model integrates a virtual topological Path-Map with sparse map features to obtain global localization. The graph-based back-end optimizes online the vehicle trajectory and the landmarks' configuration to create a globally aligned map. Furthermore, our method allows weaker requirements in terms of accuracy of the sparse feature map as we represent the degree of uncertainty by means of probabilistic distribution. Additionally, the sparse feature map representation needs substantially less memory than other approaches, which is an advantage for autonomous vehicles. The framework has been tested and evaluated in real experiments for several autonomous runs.

108,108,Simulation of Man in the Middle Attack on Smart Grid Testbed,"Over the past decade, the frequency of cyber attacks against power grids has steadily increased, requiring researchers to find and patch vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Our research introduces the prototype of a man-in-the-middle attack to be implemented on a microgrid emulator of a smart grid. We present a method of violating the integrity and authentication of packets that are using the IEEE Synchrophasor Protocol in a controlled environment, but this same approach could be used on any other protocol that lacks the proper overhead to ensure the integrity and authenticity of packets. In future research, we plan to implement and test the attack on the previously mentioned smart grid testbed in order to assess the attacks feasibility and tangible effects on Wide Area Monitoring and Control applications, as well as propose possible countermeasures. For this paper, we developed a working simulation of our intended attack using the software ModelSim 10.4. The attack will modify network packet data coming from a Schweitzer Engineering Labs (SEL) Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) hardware sensor, which provides a stream of precise timing values associated with current and voltage values, as these measured values are en route to the Open Phasor Data Concentrator (OpenPDC) application running on a Windows server.

109,109,Examining user experience of eLearning systems implemented in two universities in Tanzania,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the factors that influence user experience (UX) of eLearning systems implemented in two institutions in Tanzania. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted questionnaire consisting of Nielsen’s heuristics and didactic metrics as pragmatic metrics and hedonic metrics followed by focus group discussions with students. Findings: The study found that the eLearning system of University of Dar es Salaam had 43 UX problems related to Nielsen’s heuristics and 54 UX problems related to didactic heuristics. The eLearning system of the Open University of Tanzania had 50 UX problems related to Nielsen’s heuristics and 59 UX problems related to didactic heuristics. Moreover, the two systems provided positive UX hedonic quality on identification and evocation dimensions while stimulation was perceived to be neutral. Research limitations/implications: The study has used learners as evaluators rather than expert evaluators. Learners are not particularly experienced in the learning domain, and therefore, it is difficult for them to identify many didactic violations of the eLearning systems.

110,110,Assessing SB effort via a non-invasive model-based method in mechanically ventilated patients in Malaysian ICU hospital," All rights reserved.Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) required mechanical ventilation (MV) for breathing support. However, some MV patients encountered spontaneous breathing (SB) efforts while fully sedated which can obscure the true underlying respiratory mechanics of these patients. Thus, a model-based method is required to reconstruct the missing pressure and calculate the breathing effort that produced by the patients without additional clinical protocols or invasive procedure. In this paper, results of spontaneous breathing effort in Malaysian critically-ill patients adopting the developed pressure reconstruction model are presented. By using the pressure reconstruction model, the SB affected pressure waveform is reconstructed to approximate true respiratory mechanics and quantifies the SB effort. The SB breathing efforts were computed and compared with the results from Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand. The substitute measure of SB effort can be indicated from the difference between the reconstructed and unreconstructed pressure. Results shows that all patients from both cohorts exhibited SB effort with the highest SB effort at 11.48% for Malaysian patient and 21.07% for Christchurch patient. Overall, the well-developed non-invasive pressure reconstruction method is able to measure the SB effort produced by Malaysian MV patients that help the clinicians in selecting the optimal MV setting. This first non-invasive guidance in selecting the optimal setting of MV in Malaysia is potentially reduced the ICU cost and improve the MV management in Malaysian hospital.",60020585,University of Canterbury,Christchurch,New Zealand,"['1711', '1710', '1708', '1705']",22.7,0.22202797202797203,0.5663752913752913,0
111,111,Robust aerial image mosaicing algorithm based on fuzzy outliers rejection,"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) imagery for acquiring data is constantly evolving, due to the ease of use and low data acquisition costs. All of these made UAVs very popular with end customers and data acquisition companies. For most cases, the acquired UAV images need further more processing before being analyzed, and that because of changing of illumination condition in aerial environment and fog generated because of UAV flying speed. Image mosaicing is a practical solution for these problems; in which overlapped views of the same scene are combined to form a large image with high quality. The common problem associated with image mosaicing algorithms is the false associations (outliers) produced when defining the overlapping region between every two successive views. This article presents an image mosaicing algorithm based on efficient fuzzy technique for outliers rejection. Our proposed technique is based on using RANdom SAmpling Consensus (RANSAC) and bidirectional approaches with a fuzzy inference system in order to separate between inliers and outliers. The experimental results prove that the proposed method has good performance for aerial images and gives better results when compared with other techniques.

113,113,Comparison of Doubling the Size of Image Algorithms,"Abstract: In this paper the comparative analysis for quality of some interpolation non-adaptive methods of doubling the image size is carried out. We used the value of a mean square error for estimation accuracy (quality) approximation. Artifacts (aliasing, Gibbs effect (ringing), blurring, etc.) introduced by interpolation methods were not considered. The description of the doubling interpolation upscale algorithms are presented, such as: the nearest neighbor method, linear and cubic interpolation, Lanczos convolution interpolation (with a = 1, 2, 3), and 17-point interpolation method. For each method of upscaling to twice optimal coefficients of kernel convolutions for different down-scale to twice algorithms were found. Various methods for reducing the image size by half were considered the mean value over 4 nearest points and the weighted value of 16 nearest points with optimal coefficients. The optimal weights were calculated for each method of doubling described in this paper. The optimal weights were chosen in such a way as to minimize the value of mean square error between the accurate value and the found approximation. A simple method performing correction for approximation of any algorithm of doubling size is offered. The proposed correction method shows good results for simple interpolation algorithms. However, these improvements are insignificant for complex algorithms (17-point interpolation, Lanczos a = 3). According to the results of numerical experiments, the most accurate among the reviewed algorithms is the 17-point interpolation method, slightly worse is Lanczos convolution interpolation with the parameter a = 3 (see Table 2).",60008036,Ivanovo State University,Ivanovo,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",20.5,0.012239583333333352,0.5256324404761905,1

116,116,Transformation towards agile software product line engineering in large companies: A literature review,"Almost all companies struggle with software systems that are getting increasingly complex. Therefore, in particular large companies often use software product lines, which provide an efficient way to manage software reuse as well as the high complexity. However, software product lines seem to be too slow to react to changes. Agile development approaches promise to meet this demand. At the same time, integrating an agile approach is not always easy. Consequently, there is a need for a transformation model that supports the agile transformation without harming the benefits of software product lines. In this paper, we present the results of a literature review regarding agile transformation in large software companies. Our results summarize the insights from 85 papers and present a list of 20 tasks and tasks that are recommended by several researchers to be considered during the transformation. On the basis of these results, we create an agile transformation model—the so-called “agile hamburger”—that contains these tasks and preserves software product lines.

117,117,Analysis of Influence of Different Relations Types on the Quality of Thesaurus Application to Text Classification Problems,"Abstract: The main purpose of the article is to analyze how effectively different types of thesaurus relations can be used for solutions of text classification tasks. The basis of the study is an automatically generated thesaurus of a domain, that contains three types of relations: synonymous, hierarchical and associative. To generate the thesaurus the authors use a hybrid method based on several linguistic and statistical algorithms for extraction of semantic relations. The method allows to create a thesaurus with a sufficiently large number of terms and relations among them. The authors consider two problems: topical text classification and sentiment classification of large newspaper articles. To solve them, the authors developed two approaches that complement standard algorithms with a procedure that take into account thesaurus relations to determine semantic features of texts. The approach to topical classification includes the standard unsupervised BM25 algorithm and the procedure, that take into account synonymous and hierarchical relations of the thesaurus of the domain. The approach to sentiment classification consists of two steps. At the first step, a thesaurus is created, whose terms weight polarities are calculated depending on the term occurrences in the training set or on the weights of related thesaurus terms. At the second step, the thesaurus is used to compute the features of words from texts and to classify texts by the algorithm SVM or Naive Bayes. In experiments with text corpora BBCSport, Reuters, PubMed and the corpus of articles about American immigrants, the authors varied the types of thesaurus relations that are involved in the classification and the degree of their use. The results of the experiments make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of the application of thesaurus relations for classification of raw texts and to determine under what conditions certain relations affect more or less. In particular, the most useful thesaurus relations are synonymous and hierarchical, as they provide a better quality of classification.",60001420,Yaroslavl State University,Yaroslavl,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",24.307692307692307,0.10115018315018313,0.3182710622710622,1
118,118,Causality-based Social Media Analysis for Normal Users Credibility Assessment in a Political Crisis,"Information trustworthiness assessment on political social media discussions is crucial to maintain the order of society, especially during emergent situations. The polarity nature of political topics and the echo chamber effect by social media platforms allow for a deceptive and a dividing environment. During a political crisis, a vast amount of information is being propagated on social media, that leads up to a high level of polarization and deception by the beneficial parties. The traditional approaches to tackling misinformation on social media usually lack a comprehensive problem definition due to its complication. This paper proposes a probabilistic graphical model as a theoretical view on the problem of normal users credibility on social media during a political crisis, where polarization and deception are keys properties. Such noisy signals dramatically influence any attempts for misinformation detection. Hence, we introduce a causal Bayesian network, inspired by the potential main entities that would be part of the process dynamics. Our methodology examines the problem solution in a causal manner which considers the task of misinformation detection as a question of cause and effect rather than just a classification task. Our causality-based approach provides a practical road map for some sub-problems in real-world scenarios such as individual polarization level, misinformation detection, and sensitivity analysis of the problem. Moreover, it facilitates intervention simulations which would unveil both positive and negative effects on the deception level over the network.",60080184,University of Agder,Kristiansand,Norway,['1700'],23.2,0.007824242424242425,0.40308484848484855,1
119,119,Security and Fault Detection in In-node components of IIoT Constrained Devices,"The last decade has witnessed a paradigm change in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), from closed, isolated systems to fully-connected, Internet-capable systems. At the same time, new wireless technologies, mainly coming from the Internet of Things domain, emerged. IEEE 802.15.4 wireless-based standards like WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, ZigBee, and WIA-PA are increasingly used for monitoring industrial processes. Nevertheless, along with this paradigm change, some new threats appeared that menace current industrial infrastructures and economies (e.g., Stuxnet, Mariposa, Slammer). Additionally, in order to keep up with the requirements of new Industry 4.0 applications, sensor nodes software and hardware are becoming more complex and, thus, more prone to faults. In this paper, using a monitoring architecture proposed in our previous work, we injected and subsequently proceeded to detect representative firmware and hardware anomalies (namely, buffer overflow attacks, SPI faults, under-voltage, and high temperature faults) that can be used by attackers to cause major losses or even damage industrial control systems. We evaluated the performance of several machine learning techniques commonly used to detect anomalies (i.e. OCSVM, kNN, AutoEnconder), in order to determine if they could be useful to detect such faults.

120,120,Research on Ship Classification Based on Trajectory Association,"Many ships have AIS devices that can provide information such as the types of ships, which can help the maritime authorities manage the marine traffic in a better way. However, when some ships do not have AIS devices installed or turn off these devices, it is desirable to identify the types of ships by the trajectory features provided by radar. In order to achieve this goal, first, the trajectories are generated based on the obtained AIS points and radar points, and then the radar trajectories are associated with the AIS trajectories to obtain the labels of the radar trajectories. Next, three types of features of radar trajectories are extracted. Due to the small amount of experimental data and the problem of class imbalance, this paper proposes a heterogeneous ensemble learning method based on EasyEnsemble and SMOTE when training the ship classification model. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to homogeneous ensemble learning and heterogeneous ensemble learning without SMOTE methods. Moreover, the method can identify almost all the minority class samples and has certain application value.",60016930,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China,['1700'],25.571428571428573,0.18084415584415584,0.4436147186147185,1

An actual scientific problem is to determine the latter basing on the user's speech signal. In particular, it can be solved relying on investigating the jitter of the speech pitch period. In this paper we propose an algorithm that allows one to improve the noise immunity of determining the pitch period of speech signal and a method of jitter determination based on averaging the change of the pitch period relatively to the current value. We also propose an algorithm for separating periodic and random pitch jitter based on using the discrete Fourier transform on the sequence of the pitch periods with the presence of unknown values in the unvoiced speech frames.

In this paper, we address the issue of inspecting entries in SDN flow tables by actively probing the data plane. iRecent works such as Monocle and Pronto address this by inserting a test rule per OpenFlow entry. However, this leads to an excessive increase in the size of the OpenFlow tables and unfortunately a wastage of the already scarce TCAM memory and an increase in the packet matching time. We present an efficient testing approach that uses a minimal number of test rules, as large as the number of the neighboring switches which is a handful number compared to Monocle and Pronto where the number of test of rules can be in the order of thousands depending on the size of the OpenFlow table.

123,123,Sentiment Analysis of Posts and Comments in the Accounts of Russian Politicians on the Social Network,"Russian politicians are increasingly using social networks publishing a lot of texts. One of the important issues in the context of the analysis of political online communication is the choice of negative and positive topics in publications as well as the reaction of the audience. In order to analyze the main patterns of this process we have collected the data from the social network Vkontakte. Our sample covers the period from 1 January, 2017 to 25 April, 2019, in total 46293 posts and 2197063 comments in 23 politician's accounts. To build the classifier we used two text corpora: Rubtsova's corpus and RuSentiment corpus. The algorithm of sentiment analysis was implemented on the basis of bidirectional recurrent neural network. Using Rubtsova's corpus we provided the accuracy of 91% and using RuSentiment we provided the accuracy of 84% (accuracy is calculated as the proportion of correctly identified cases from the test sample). We found that the markup of data significantly differs when different corpora were used. The most adequate results in the analysis of posts and comments, in our opinion, are obtained by using an ensemble of models based on the both corpora. As a result of classification, we identified a number of patterns. Thus, the number of likes and views of posts is higher for the posts classified as positive, and the number of reposts is higher for the posts classified as negative. We also found that the number of comments is higher for the posts with a negative sentiment, and the average sentiment of comments on positive posts is more positive than the average sentiment of comments on negative posts.",60031888,Saint Petersburg State University,Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,['1700'],22.5,0.10003030303030302,0.44827272727272727,1

Our motivation for this paper is to create a straight-forward, nondata-intensive framework for blind steganalysis that only requires examples of cover images and a single embedding algorithm for training. Our blind steganalysis framework addresses the case of algorithm mismatch, where a classifier is trained on one algorithm and tested on another, with four spatial embedding algorithms: LSB matching, MiPOD, S-UNIWARD and WOW. We use RAW image data from the BOSSbase database and and data collected from six iPhone devices. Ensemble Classifiers with Spatial Rich Model features are trained on a single embedding algorithm and tested on each of the four algorithms.

125,125,Multimodal localization for autonomous agents,"Inventory management and handling in warehouse environments have transformed large retail fulfillment centers. Often hundreds of autonomous agents scurry about fetching and delivering products to fulfill customer orders. Repetitive movements such as these are ideal for a robotic platform to perform. One of the major hurdles for an autonomous system in a warehouse is accurate robot localization in a dynamic industrial environment. Previous LiDAR-based localization schemes such as adaptive Monte Carlo localization (AMCL) are effective in indoor environments and can be initialized in new environments with relative ease. However, AMCL can be influenced negatively by accumulated odometry drift, and is also reliant primarily on a single modality for scene understanding which limits the localization performance. We propose a robust localization system which combines multiple sensor sources and deep neural networks for accurate real-time localization in warehouses. Our system employs a novel deep neural network architecture consisting of multiple heterogeneous deep neural networks.

126,126,Automatic estimation of the position and orientation of the drill to be grasped and manipulated by the disaster response robot based on analyzing depth camera information,"Towards the actualization of a disaster response robot that can locate and manipulate a drill at an arbitrary position with an arbitrary posture in disaster sites, this paper proposes a method that can estimate the position and orientation of the drill that is to be grasped and manipulated by the robot arm, by utilizing the depth camera information acquired by the depth camera. In this paper's algorithm, first, using a conventional method, the target drill is detected on the basis of an RGB image captured by the depth camera, and 3D point cloud data representing the target is generated by combining the detection results and the depth image. Second, using our proposed method, the generated point cloud data is processed to estimate the information on the proper position and orientation for grasping the drill. More specifically, a pass through filter is applied to the generated 3D point cloud data obtained by the first step. Then, the point cloud is divided, and features are classified so that the chuck and handle are identified. By computing the centroid of the point cloud for the chuck, the position for grasping is obtained. By applying Principal Component Analysis, the orientation for grasping is obtained. Experiments were conducted on a simulator. The results show that our method could accurately estimate the proper configuration for the autonomous grasping a normal-type drill.",60023462,Waseda University,Tokyo,Japan,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",25.0,0.13246753246753248,0.38701298701298703,1

Two-people groups usually walk in a side-by-side formation and three-people groups walk in a V-formation so that they can see each other. For this reason, the proposed method combines a Side-by-side and V-formation pedestrian model with the Anticipative Kinodynamic Planner (AKP). Combining these methods, the robot is able to do an anticipatory accompaniment of groups of humans, as well as to avoid static and dynamic obstacles in advance, while keeping the prescribed formations. The proposed framework allows also a dynamical re-positioning of the robot, if the physical position of the partners change in the group formation. Furthermore, people have a randomness factor that the robot has to manage, for that reason, the system was adapted to deal with changes in people's velocity, orientation and occlusions. Finally, the method has been validated using synthetic experiments and real-life experiments with our Tibi robot.

Conventional deep convolutional feature-based discriminative visual tracking algorithms require continuous re-training of classifiers or correlation filters, which involve solving complex optimization tasks to adapt to the new appearance of a target object. To alleviate this complex process, our proposed algorithm incorporates and utilizes a meta-learner network to provide the matching network with new appearance information of the target objects by adding target-aware feature space. The parameters for the target-specific feature space are provided instantly from a single forward-pass of the meta-learner network. By eliminating the necessity of continuously solving complex optimization tasks in the course of tracking, experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs at a real-time speed while maintaining competitive performance among other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.",60120116,Automation and Systems Research Institute,Seoul,South Korea,"['1712', '1707']",28.4,-0.06665834165834164,0.3478604728604729,1
129,129,A translucency classification for computer graphics,"Translucency is a visual property attributed to objects that light may cross without transmitting a clear image of the scene which is behind. In absence of a more precise definition, this perceptual attribute is often considered as an intermediate between transparency, which is the property of objects that light may cross by transmitting a clear image of the scene behind, and opacity, which is the property of blocking the transmission of light and therefore masking completely the scene behind. If it is rather clear that translucency is closely related to light scattering, it is difficult to classify the translucent appearance according to one scale only, due to the different types of scattering, which can occur as well as the role of absorbance and thickness of the material. Through synthetic images rendered by optical models, we show that surface scattering, volume (or subsurface) scattering, possibly mixed with selective absorption, produce different types of translucency effects and different intermediates between transparency and opacity. We thus propose to represent translucency according to three axes related to these three optical phenomena: surface scattering, volume scattering, and absorption.",60068548,Laboratoire Hubert Curien UMR CNRS 5516,Saint-Etienne,France,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",36.6,0.04086538461538463,0.49903846153846154,1

In such interfering environments, especially, it is necessary to maximally increase transmission opportunities by smartly and autonomously discovering multiple frames that can be transferred in parallel. One typical approach is to control CST (Carrier Sense Threshold). However, a frame, intended to transfer in parallel with the precedence frame transfer, may interrupt the precedence transfer, which results in the loss of the precedence frame. In addition, the interference with ACKs replied from receiver stations is not considered. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a parallel frame transfer method based on strict judgement for the parallel transfer of multiple frames. In this judgement, all the frames transferred in parallel are intended to result in success, and the possibility of the parallel transfer with the replied ACKs is also checked.",60008107,Osaka Prefecture University,Sakai,Japan,"['1705', '1708']",20.285714285714285,0.04672619047619048,0.2558035714285714,1

Although various community programs are available to promote active ageing among seniors who are well, provide befriending services for seniors at risk of isolation and care and support for frail and vulnerable seniors, it is not easy to differentiate between 'well' seniors and 'at risk' seniors. While privacy-preserving z-wave based sensor-enabled homes have been piloted in 100 homes of seniors living alone and have been successful in the timely detection of at-risk seniors, they have limited scalability due to high costs, reliability issues and high maintenance needs. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate Sigfox-based sensor-enabled homes for detecting of at-risk seniors, benchmark our results against the incumbent system, and study the tradeoffs between battery lifespan and detection accuracy. From the evaluation, we observe that while maintaining a similar battery lifespan, the Sigfox-based system is able to match the accuracy in detecting at-risk seniors at a fraction of the cost of the incumbent sensor system.",60018933,Singapore Management University,Singapore City,Singapore,"['1705', '1708']",34.4,0.07873626373626373,0.5235531135531135,1
133,133,A Mathematical Model for Optimal Number of Heat Consumers Connection to the Heat Supply System,"Abstract: In the modern world, the efficient use of energy is an extremely important aspect of human activity. In particular, heat supply systems have significant economic, environmental and social importance for both heat consumers and heat supply organizations. The economic status of all participants in the heat supply process depends on the efficiency of the functioning of the heat supply-systems. The reliability of the functioning of systems depends on vital processes such as the work of hospitals and industrial enterprises. With such a close network communication, reliable and efficient operation of power supply systems is critical. In this article, ways to improve the efficiency of heat supply systems are considered. A mathematical model for improved planning of heat supply systems by connecting the optimal set of new heat consumers is presented. For each single customer, when there is an alternative option for connecting this consumer to the existing heat network, it is possible to choose the only optimal solution. This becomes possible due to the restrictions and the procedure for selecting variants from a subset of binary variables corresponding to alternatives. The procedure for finding the optimal number of consumers for connection to the existing heat network is presented, which is the rationale for increasing the number of existing consumers of the heat network. The testing was carried out and the results of the mathematical model by an example of test heat networks are presented.

Each user requires content that matches with their device capability and network conditions. This motivates the need for flexible video transcoding, which enables changing the properties of videos on-the-fly to fit different users. However, the transcoding process is compute intensive especially when handling modern video coding standards such as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and supporting emerging applications such as live broadcasts. Consequently, there is a need for lightweight and resource-efficient systems that can perform transcoding quickly at real-time to sustain desired user QoE requirements. We design and implement a container-based video transcoding system to address this need. We experimentally show that our system can meet real-time transcoding while using less computational resources than a native transcoding approach.

The method constists of two steps. First, disparity estimates are refined, by filling gaps of invalid disparity and removing halos of incorrectly assigned disparity. A coarse segmentation is obtained by identifying depth slices, after which objects are clustered based on color and texture information using Gabor filters. The second step consists of reconstructing the resulting objects in 3D for scene alignment by fitting a planar region. A 2D triangle mesh is generated, and a 3D mesh model is obtained by projecting each triangle onto the fitted plane. Both of these extensions result in improved alignment quality with respect to the state of the art, and operate in near real time using multi-threading.

143,143,Performance Modelling of V2V based Collective Perceptions in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,"With the introduction of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), it is possible to extend the limited horizon of vehicles on the road by collective perceptions, where vehicles periodically share their sensory information with others using Vehide-2-Vehicle (V2V) communications. This technique relies on a certain number of participants to have a measurable advantage. Nevertheless, the spread of CAVs will take a considerable period of time, it is critical to understand the benefits and limits of V2V based collective perceptions in different market stages. In this work, we characterise the effective Field of View (eFoV) of a vehicle as the perception range using local sensors only, and the collective Field of View (cFoV) as the region learn from the network. Applying analytic and simulation studies in highway scenarios, we show that the eFoV drops quickly with the increase in traffic density due to blockage effects of surrounding vehicles, and it is insufficient to overcome this problem by increasing the sensing range of local sensors. On the other hand, vehicles can gain around 16 folds more information about the road environment by leveraging collective perceptions with only 10% CAV penetration rate. When the penetration rate reaches to around 30%, collective perceptions can provide 95% coverage over the road environments. Our analyses also show that apart from the benefits, employing collective perceptions could result in heavy broadcast redundancy, hence wasting the already scarce network resources.

This fact has reinforced the vision of developing new communication technologies and finding new ways to synchronize and successfully manage all these data sources. However, this vision is accompanied by several related challenges. One of these challenges refers to the fact that since all the existing IoT medical data sources are usually characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity, they are expected to be recognized as reliable at different stages, thus providing data of different levels of reliability. To effectively tackle this challenge, the present paper proposes a mechanism for capturing the reliability levels of different IoT medical data sources, so as to automatically decide whether these will be considered as reliable or not, and thus their data will be kept for further analysis. In this context, in this mechanism three (3) discrete stages are implemented, facilitating both the data reliability and the availability estimation of these data sources, making finally feasible the manipulation of these sources and the estimation of their overall reliability levels.

We consider the scenario that may become common in devices with Multi SIM and eUICC, in which one subscription is used for primary services such as voice and data, and another subscription is used for AKMA services. In this scenario, the purpose is to use AKMA services simultaneously and without interrupting primary services. There are existing requirements for Multi SIM and eUICC, which restrain this scenario from being successful. The solution that we propose includes arrangements and adaptations, in order to provide secure and uninterrupted services of both primary and AKMA services.",60103653,Aalto University,Espoo,Finland,['1700'],22.571428571428573,0.18214285714285713,0.41683673469387755,1

In computer vision and image understanding applications, image segmentation is an important pre-processing step. The main goal of the segmentation process is the separation of foreground region from background region. The segmentation approaches are application specific and do not work well for both grayscale and colour image segmentation. For any image consisting of foreground and background, some transition regions exist between the foreground and background regions.

Due to the active development of industries using the concept of the Internet of Things, the information security problem is getting more and more important. To create a protected module of information-telecommunication system which implements the Internet of Things concept, it is important to take into account all its aspects. To determine relevant threats, it is necessary to use the detailed risk analysis according to existing standards. Then choosing protection measures, one must rely on identified relevant threats. Actual threats and necessary protective actions are determined in this paper for implementation of Smart House computer appliance module, in order to develop a protected part of Smart House, which is necessary for realization of room access control.

Self-healing is one of the hot spots in the faulty recovery field. Recently, more and more bio-inspired methods have been proposed to deal with the self-healing problem. However, there are a lot of problems that should be studied further, such as the bioinspired self-healing mechanism and the efficiency of the bio-inspired self-healing methods. In this paper, an improved bio-inspired selfhealing method based on the immune-inspired swarm aggregation algorithm is proposed for the multi-robot system, and the power shortage failure recovery is used as the concrete self-healing task. In the proposed approach, a hybrid algorithm of discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is presented, to choose the donor robots efficiently. In addition, an improved swarm aggregation algorithm based on fuzzy control is proposed to improve the concentration degree of multi-robot system in swarm aggregation process and maintain the stability of the multi-robot system in the self-healing process.

158,158,Network-Assisted D2D Relay Selection Under the Presence of Dynamic Obstacles,"Millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in device to device (D2D) communication are susceptible to blockages in spite of using directional beams from multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antennas to compensate for high propagation loss. This motivates one to look for the presence of obstacles while forming D2D links among user equipments (UEs) which are in motion. In D2D communication, moving UEs also act as relays to forward data from one UE to another which introduces the problem of relay selection. The problem becomes more challenging when the obstacles are also in motion (dynamic obstacles) along with the moving UEs. First we have developed a probabilistic model for relay selection which considers both moving UEs and dynamic obstacles. Then we have analyzed the probability of dynamic obstacles blocking a link in 3D Euclidean space by exploiting the information from MIMO radar connected to the base station. Finally, using this information, we have developed unique strategies based on simple geometry to find the best relay which maximizes the expected data rate. Through simulations we have shown that our proposed strategy gives a significant improvement in packet loss due to mobility of nodes and dynamic obstacles in a mmWave channel over the traditional approaches which do not consider dynamic obstacle's presence.",60024948,"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata",Kolkata,India,"['1705', '1708']",25.625,0.07826923076923076,0.3793772893772893,1

164,164,Cloud Service for Interactive Simulation of Interregional Trade Flows,"Abstract: The paper describes a mathematical model of trade flows between the territories of a region or a country in a transportation network having one or more different types of marine or ground transport. We use the approach of modeling complex communication systems to determine the most probable values of flows in case of incomplete information about the system. Transportation costs between the territories are modeled within the framework of the gravity model. The payment for transportation depends on the distance between regions, the distance is estimated as the shortest way length in a given transportation network or geographical distance. The mathematical formulation of the problem belongs to the class of convex mathematical programming problems and assumes the numerical solution of nonlinear optimization problem with linear constraints. Based on the model, the software is implemented as a cloud service on heterogeneous computing architectures: the simulation module is made on a high-performance server platform, management and visualization modules are produced with IACPaaS cloud platform. Communication between the platforms is established via asynchronous http-queries. For information exchange between the modules the declarative model with JSON format is developed and implemented for the objects considered in the mathematical model which are products, areas and communications.

165,165,Word Embedding for Semantically Related Words: An Experimental Study,"Abstract—: The ability to identify semantic relations between words has made a word2vec model widely used in NLP tasks. The idea of word2vec is based on a simple rule that a higher similarity can be reached if two words have a similar context. Each word can be represented as a vector, so the closest coordinates of vectors can be interpreted as similar words. It allows to establish semantic relations (synonymy, relations of hypernymy and hyponymy and other semantic relations) by applying an automatic extraction. The extraction of semantic relations by hand is considered as a time-consuming and biased task, requiring a large amount of time and some help of experts. Unfortunately, the word2vec model provides an associative list of words which does not consist of relative words only. In this paper, we show some additional criteria that may be applicable to solve this problem. Observations and experiments with well-known characteristics, such as word frequency, a position in an associative list, might be useful for improving results for the extraction of semantic relations for the Russian language by using word embedding. In the experiments, the word2vec model trained on the Flibusta and pairs from Wiktionary are used as examples with semantic relationships.

Towards enhancing resilience against extreme risks, such networks need to continuously assess their security posture and prioritize possible remediation actions based on security risk. The contribution of this work is to provide an integrated risk-based decision-support methodology for prioritizing risk remediation activities. Our methodology leverages the Time-To-Compromise security metric to quantitatively assess the compromise risk. Furthermore, it employs game-theory principles to model the strategic behaviour of the involved players (e.g., defender and attacker). The novelty of this approach lies in the way it integrates the risk attitude of the decision makers involved in the patch management operations across critical organizations into the prioritization process.",60014151,Universität Passau,Passau,Germany,"['1705', '1708']",19.333333333333332,0.008333333333333338,0.711111111111111,1

169,169,SPONGE: Software-Defined Traffic Engineering to Absorb Influx of Network Traffic,"Existing shortest path-based routing in wide area networks or equal cost multi-path routing in data center networks do not consider the load on the links while taking routing decisions. As a consequence, an influx of network traffic stemming from events such as distributed link flooding attacks and data shuffle during large scale analytics can congest network links despite the network having sufficient capacity on alternate paths to absorb the traffic. This can have several negative consequences such as service unavailability, delayed flow completion, packet losses, among others. In this regard, we propose SPONGE, a traffic engineering mechanism for handling sudden influx of network traffic. SPONGE models the network as a stochastic process, takes the switch queue occupancy and traffic rate as inputs, and leverages the multiple available paths in the network to route traffic in a way that minimizes the overall packet loss in the network. We demonstrate the practicality of SPONGE through an OpenFlow based implementation, where we periodically and pro-actively re-route network traffic to the routes computed by SPONGE. Mininet emulations using real network topologies show that SPONGE is capable of reducing packet drops by 20% on average even when the network is highly loaded because of an ongoing link flooding attack.",60109902,IMT Lille Douai,Villeneuve-d'Ascq,France,"['1705', '1708']",29.142857142857142,0.030840336134453784,0.30109243697478993,1

Algorithms developed for undirected networks cannot be used with social networks characterized by directed edges. We present a method to extract the network topology from a small sample of distance measures without the need for exhaustive measurements. Tolerating missing data is also necessary when certain nodes participate in message passing, but are not accessible for direct measurements. An anchor-based sampling approach is proposed and compared with random sampling. As we demonstrate, real-world directed social networks such as Twitter and US election blogs have hop-distance matrices that are low-rank. Low-rank matrix completion techniques are thus used to recover the complete topology from a relatively small set of measurements. Evaluation of the proposed technique using metrics such as distance distribution, degree distribution, and hop-distances show that the proposed technique is effective even when only a small fraction of distance entries are available.",60011410,Worcester Polytechnic Institute,Worcester,United States,"['1705', '1708']",19.0,0.03812111801242237,0.4650621118012423,1

More specifically, we first implement GMM to characterize the spatial distribution of each category. Then, a novel GMM-based data formation method is performed to extract distance and density features, called GMDD. By sufficiently utilizing the classification information contained in the original data, GMDD constructs concise and high-quality characteristics. Finally, k-NN is trained and tested on newly transformed datasets to build the detection model.

173,173,Credible repair of Sony main-sensor PDAF striping artifacts,"Since the introduction of the Minolta Maxxum 9000 in 1985, PDAF (phase detect automatic focus) has been the standard way to achieve sharply-focused images of fast-moving action, such as professional sports. In a typical SLR (single lens reflex) camera, the image for the optical viewfinder is reflected up by the main mirror, while a secondary mirror and optics copy the image to the PDAF detector. However, such an arrangement is impractical for mirrorless digital cameras. Thus, there have been a variety of methods used to incorporate phase sensing on the main sensor - with various trade-offs. The current work discusses some of these trade-offs and then describes in detail a specific type of striping artifact introduced by the masked pixel structures used in Sony sensors. A computational method for credible repair of this artifact also is presented.

175,175,On Methods of the Verification and Elaboration of Development Programs for Agricultural Territories,"Abstract: Nowadays, the methods of program-targeted management for the development of various socio-economic systems of complex structure, such as agricultural areas, have become ubiquitous. Therefore, the current tasks at hand are the verification of already created development programs and the development of “proper” programs for the development of such systems, by analogy with the verification and development of proper computer programs through advanced disciplines in theoretical programming. In this paper, in order to solve the problem of the verification of development programs for agricultural territories, a structural scheme of the program is first constructed, through which an axiomatic theory is created using the Hoare’s algorithmic logic system. The main problem in the construction of the axiomatic theory is the development of the axioms of the theory that reflect preconditions and effects of the implementation of meaningful actions indicated in the text of the development program. The verification of the development program corresponds to the provability check of some Hoare triplet, according to the initial and target conditions of the program. For the task of elaborating proper development programs, we describe the mechanism for constructing a domain model using the PDDL family description languages. The description of a specific model is purely declarative in nature and consists of descriptions of predicates and actions of the chosen subject area. In this paper, using the described model with the help of intelligent planners, including temporal planners such as OPTIC, we show how to automatically build solutions to the targets of development programs. Based on expert knowledge and industry standards, a model of an agricultural territory is constructed, a brief description of which is given in this work. The conducted experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the development of proper development programs.",60070941,Kazan Federal University,Kazan,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",29.1,0.081055900621118,0.3416666666666666,1

The main part of the processing and query evaluation is just access to the data themselves. If there are a suitable index and conditions, access can be optimized. Vice versa, if there is no relevant index, the whole table must be scanned sequentially, which can bring high demands and processing steps resulting in poor performance. This paper deals with index access methods, the process of the data access, its optimization, architecture and whole apparatus.

This achieves the wider deployment of such wireless access networks with a smaller number (cost) of base stations. Connection control that decides which wireless network should be used for each wireless station is also proposed to increase the effective network capacity of the wireless access network.

By now, quite a lot of code-based cryptosystems are known; however, their cryptographic security is inferior to that of the classical McEliece cryptosystem. In connection with the development of quantum computing, code-based cryptosystems are considered as an alternative to number theoretical ones; therefore, the problem of seeking promising classes of codes to construct new secure code-based cryptosystems is relevant. For this purpose, noncommutative codes can be used, that is, ideals in group algebras FqG over finite noncommutative groups $$G$$. The security of cryptosystems based on codes induced by subgroup codes has been studied earlier. The Artin–Wedderburn theorem, which proves the existence of an isomorphism of a group algebra to the direct sum of matrix algebras, is important for studying noncommutative codes. However, the particular form of terms and the construction of the isomorphism are not specified by this theorem; thus, for each group, there remains the problem of constructing the Wedderburn representation. The complete Wedderburn decomposition for the group algebra FqD2n over the dihedral group D2n has been obtained by F.E. Brochero Martinez in the case when the cardinality of the field and the order of the group are relatively prime numbers. Using these results, we study codes in the group algebra FqD2n in this paper. The problem on the structure of all codes is solved, and the structure of codes induced by codes over cyclic subgroups of D2n is described, which is of interest for cryptographic applications.",60110193,Spetsvuzavtomatika Russia,Rostov-on-Don,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",23.90909090909091,0.13456439393939396,0.45757575757575764,1
180,180,A Lesson in Scaling 6LoWPAN - Minimal Fragment Forwarding in Lossy Networks,"This paper evaluates two forwarding strategies for fragmented datagrams in the IoT: hop-wise reassembly and a minimal approach to direct forwarding of fragments. Direct fragment forwarding is challenged by the lack of forwarding information at subsequent fragments in 6LoWPAN and thus requires additional data at nodes. We compare the two approaches in extensive experiments evaluating reliability, end-to-end latency, and memory consumption. In contrast to previous work and due to our real-world testbed setup, we obtained different results and conclusions. Our findings indicate that direct fragment forwarding should be deployed with care, since higher packet transmission rates on the link layer can significantly reduce its reliability, which in turn can even further reduce end-to-end latency because of highly increased link layer retransmissions.",60032697,Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg,Hamburg,Germany,"['1705', '1708']",24.2,0.05333333333333334,0.44153846153846155,1
181,181,Application Level Performance Measurements of Multi-Connectivity Options in Cellular Networks for Vehicular Scenarios,"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and vehicle passengers request for high-speed and reliable data access from vehicle to infrastructure networks. For example, passengers like to consume multimedia services and new use cases arise from ITS and connected vehicular services that require high-speed and reliable connectivity solutions. To achieve these requirements multi-connectivity is a viable solution to increase throughput and reliability. Such options exist on various layers. On the network access layer multiple antennas are deployed for transmitting and receiving data in parallel data streams; on the transport layer different network access opportunities are utilized by multi-path protocols such as multi-path TCP. At the present study, we evaluate performance metrics of these options in a real-world vehicular scenario. We quantify throughput, delay, and reliability improvements of using multiple antennas and multi-path TCP and also indicate issues of multi-path TCP. Further, we demonstrate performance improvements by the change of the congestion control protocol.",60016294,Fachhochschule Flensburg,Flensburg,Germany,"['1705', '1708']",18.75,0.08512396694214876,0.359504132231405,1
182,182,Application of Neural Networks for Recognizing Rail Structural Elements in Magnetic and Eddy Current Defectograms,"Abstract—: Nondestructive testing of rails is regularly conducted using various approaches and methods, including magnetic and eddy current testing methods, to ensure railroad safety. Automatic analysis of large data arrays (defectograms) from the corresponding equipment is an important problem. The analysis is the process of detecting defective pieces and identifying structural elements of a railroad track using defectograms. This article considers the problem of recognizing patterns of structural elements of railroad rails in defectograms of multichannel magnetic and eddy current defectoscopes. Three classes of structural elements of a railroad track are investigated: (1) a bolted joint with a straight or beveled rail connection, (2) a flash butt rail weld, and (3) an aluminothermic rail weld. Patterns that cannot be assigned to these three classes are conventionally considered as defects and are attributed to a separate fourth class. Patterns of structural elements are recognized in defectograms using a neural network based on the TensorFlow open library. For this purpose, each defectogram area selected for analysis is converted into a grayscale image with a size of 20 by 39 pixels.",60001420,Yaroslavl State University,Yaroslavl,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",22.25,-0.007142857142857137,0.4602397602397602,1

184,184,How academia and society pay attention to climate changes: A bibliometric and altmetric analysis,"With the help of social web, social users can create, manage, share or react without undergoing the formal mechanisms of quality control. The way social users respond to scholarly outputs on the social web is called social citation, which can show the broadening of impact from academia to society. Climate change is one of the most life-threatening issues that everybody should be sensible and react to. Studying the scientific and social citations of articles dealing with climate changes, the present study attempts to provide new insights into the amount of social users' attention and reactions. It also investigates the correlation between scientific and social citations to shed light on the potential of altmetrics as an alternative or supplementary to its traditional predecessor. Besides, the study aims to carry out co-word analysis of scientific texts in the field and identify hot topics. Our findings showed that 3141 out of 6100 climate changes related articles retrieved from WoS were present in Altmetric explorer. They received 84380 and 17361 social and traditional citations, respectively. The articles were revealed to be mostly represented in Mendeley (133002 reads) and Tweeter (72108 tweets) followed by News outlet, Facebook, and blogs. The results of Spearman correlation test revealed a significant, though weak, correlation between WoS citations and social citations including Tweets, Mendeley readers, Facebook posts, blog posts, Google+ posts, news outlet and Article Attention Score. Multidisciplinary sciences were the most productive subject areas with the highest number of scientific and social citations. Co-word analysis of the articles showed that greenhouse gases emission; warming; species; adaptation; precipitation; energy; country, soil and crops are among the most frequent words. The value of the present study lies in the clarification of the extent to which social network users pay attention to climatic issues and how much is the power of altmetrics in showing the impact of science on society.

186,186,Semantic Coherence in Schizophrenia in Russian Written Texts,"Schizophrenia is widely known to manifest in language disturbance. Namely, speech incoherence, tangentiality, derailment are indicative of thought disorder characteristic of schizophrenia. Recent advances in distributional semantics have made it possible to measure coherence in text in a unified and objective manner. It has been shown that semantic coherence measures based on distributional semantic models in English speech significantly contribute to schizophrenia diagnosis prediction and correlate with thought disorder measures. However, information on other languages and modes is either contradictory or unavailable. The goal of the current paper is to analyze semantic coherence in schizophrenia in Russian written texts. We present a dataset of short texts written by patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and matched healthy control subjects. We have developed a number of semantic coherence measures, both replicating findings in other languages and novel ones. Our results show that in Russian written texts by patients diagnosed with schizophrenia semantic coherence values are contradictory to the findings obtained for spoken English texts. However, semantic coherence in our dataset provides an effective diagnosis predictor.

Since π-calculus is a Turing-complete computation model, this problem is unsolvable in the general case. Therefore, its study is carried out only for some special classes of π-calculus processes with restricted computational capabilities, for example, for nonrecursive processes with all runs limited in length, for processes with a limited number of parallel components, etc. However, even in these cases the proposed checking procedures are very time consuming. We assume that this is due to the very nature of the π-calculus processes. The goal of this paper is to show that even for the weakest passive adversary model and for relatively simple protocols that make use of only basic π-calculus operations, the checking of the information security properties of these protocols is a co-NP-complete problem.",60028621,Ivannikov Institute for System Programming of the RAS,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",24.666666666666668,0.031377551020408165,0.3724489795918367,1

More precisely the spectral BRDF of the display surface is measured at different incident angles with a good angular resolution to be able to simulate accurately the unwanted reflections that corrupt display contrast and color. Thanks to the angular dependence, the display aspect for an observer anywhere in front of it can be obtained rapidly for any color image and the impact of the different imperfections can be visualized and quantified. Same experimental data are use in a new generation of spectral ray tracing software.

193,193,Laser quadrat and photogrammetry based autonomous coral reef mapping ocean robot,"Coral reef ecosystems are some of the diverse and valuable ecosystems on earth. They support more species per unit area than any other marine environment and are essential to the sustenance of life in our oceans. However, due to climate change, only under 46% of the worlds coral were considered healthy as of 2008. One of the biggest challenges with regard to coral conservation is that reef mapping is currently carried out manually, with a group a divers manually moving and placing a large PVC quadrat for every unit area of the reef and then photographing and analyzing each unit separately. Hence, there is a pressing need to improve the methodology of imaging, stitching and analyzing coral reef maps in order to make it feasible to protect them and sustain life in our oceans. To improve the current methodology, a reef-mapping surface drone robot which photographs, stitches and analyzes the reef autonomously was built. This robot updates the physical quadrat which is used today, to a projected laser quadrat, which eliminates the need to dive to the bottom of the sea and allows relative pose estimation. The robot then captures and processes the images and using 3D reconstruction and computer vision algorithms is able to map and classify the coral autonomously.",60006541,The University of Hong Kong,Pokfulam,Hong Kong,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",26.375,0.16173469387755102,0.46045918367346944,1
194,194,LF+ in Coq for fast-and-loose reasoning,"We develop the metatheory and the implementation, in Coq, of the novel logical framework LF+ and discuss several of its applications. LF+ generalises research work, carried out by the authors over more than a decade, on Logical Frameworks conservatively extending LF and featuring lock-type constructors. Lock-types capture monadically the concept of inhabitability up-to. They were originally introduced for factoring-out, postponing, or delegating to external tools the verification of time-consuming judgments, which are morally proof-irrelevant, thus allowing for integrating different sources of epistemic evidence in a unique Logical Framework. Besides introducing LF+ and its ""shallow"" implementation in Coq, the main novelty of the paper is to show that lock-types arc also a very flexible tool for expressing in Type Theory several diverse cognitive attitudes and mental strategies used in ordinary reasoning, which essentially amount to reasoning up-to, as in e.g. Typical Ambiguity provisos or co-inductive Coq proofs. In particular we address the encoding of the emerging paradigm of fast-and-loose reasoning, which trades off efficiency for correctness.

As measurement data from different satellites of the same mission is often correlated to some degree, modern distributed source coding techniques are a promising approach for increasing downlink coding efficiency, thereby improving the overall mission data acquisition capability. Distributed arithmetic coding (DAC) has been extensively studied but has been applied primarily either on synthetic multi-source pseudo-random data or in single-source scenarios with real measurement data. In order to apply DAC to independent sources' measurement data of unknown entropy and correlation, we propose an adaptive DAC decoder and different use-case specific fitness functions.

Gujjarappa.The purpose of this paper is to find the reasons and preferences in the use of YouTube videos by the Indian undergraduate engineering and technology students. To find the use of YouTube videos as a supplementary source in support of learning, developing cultural understanding and obtaining behavioural benefits. A quantitative research design using a survey method was used questionnaire to collect the data. Data was analysed using frequency and percentage approach. The data sample consists of undergraduate engineering and technology students across the Indian subcontinent. The results of the data analysis reveal that the use of YouTube videos engage the students in their academics better. Over 95.0 percent of the respondents are aware and have a conviction about the supplementary role played by YouTube videos in their educational, cultural and moral life. 98.53 percent of respondents have 'learnt to respect the good things in other cultures'. 57.25 percent male and 40.74 percent female respondents have better understood the cultural difference and appreciate them. This cultural understanding has helped 'to identify good things in other cultures' by 97.84 percent respondents. The study suggests that the student use of YouTube needs to be oriented towards scholarly content to improve student engagement in the learning and enrich their knowledge. The use of YouTube videos among undergraduate engineering and technology students in India is encouraging.

The first step is to extract the number of data collection points of each machine tool and the length of TCP payload of each packet. And the second step is to use data response processing times of machine tools to construct unique fingerprint for each machine. Finally, the optimum period slice k is selected and classification accuracy is evaluated using a real-world dataset from a small-scale smart factory.

One technology that can be used in this field is Segment Routing (SR). While transferring SR approaches from theory towards an actual deployment, it quickly becomes apparent that there are many requirements and constraints that have to be satisfied. One of the most important requirement for a traffic engineering approach is the resilience against failure scenarios. In this paper, we propose a post-convergence aware 2-SR based optimization model. With it, we are able to proactively find a single SR configuration that is beneficial in all predefined failure scenarios, including single link failures, shared risk link group failures, and node failures.

204,204,Improved image selection for stack-based HDR imaging,"Stack-based high dynamic range (HDR) imaging is a technique for achieving a larger dynamic range in an image by combining several low dynamic range images acquired at different exposures. Minimizing the set of images to combine, while ensuring that the resulting HDR image fully captures the scene's irradiance, is important to avoid long image acquisition and postprocessing times. The problem of selecting the set of images has received much attention. However, existing methods either are not fully automatic, can be slow, or can fail to fully capture more challenging scenes. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic method for selecting the set of exposures to acquire that is both fast and more accurate. We show on an extensive set of benchmark scenes that our proposed method leads to improved HDR images as measured against ground truth using the mean squared error, a pixel-based metric, and a visible difference predictor and a quality score, both perception-based metrics.",60014171,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Canada,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",26.166666666666668,0.08487499999999999,0.4497083333333333,1
205,205,A superpixel-based automatic classification method for polarimetric SAR image," All rights reserved.To improve the classification accuracy of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images, a classification of algorithm based on superpixel is proposed, and the locally linear embedding (LLE) dimension reduction algorithm is improved in the process of reducing the feature dimension. The traditional image classification methods are based on pixel, and the classification effect is not satisfactory. The classification method proposed in this paper is based on superpixel segmentation combined with majority voting algorithm and Wishart algorithm. This method is superior to traditional algorithms. The LLE algorithm is improved, and the distance metric combining the Wishart distance with the Euclidean distance is proposed. This method makes the dimension reduce data more favourable for classification. Experimental results of two PolSAR images are presented in this paper. The results show that the proposed method is superior to the traditional method and can achieve better classification effect.",60016318,Chengdu University of Information Technology,Chengdu,China,"['1712', '1702']",18.25,0.2777777777777778,0.6055555555555556,0
206,206,Commutativity theorems in groups with power-like maps,"There are several commutativity theorems in groups and rings which involve power maps f(x) = xn. The most famous example of this kind is Jacobson's theorem which asserts that any ring satisfying the identity xn = x is commutative. Such statements belong to first order logic with equality and hence provable, in principle, by any first-order theorem-prover. However, because of the presence of an arbitrary integer parameter n in the exponent, they are outside the scope of any first-order theorem-prover. In particular, one cannot use such an automated reasoning system to prove theorems involving power maps. Here we focus just on the needed properties of power maps f(x) = xn and show how one can avoid having to reason explicitly with integer exponents. Implementing these new equational properties of power maps, we show how a theorem-prover can be a handy tool for quickly proving or confirming the truth of such theorems.",60009697,University of Manitoba,Winnipeg,Canada,['1701'],21.571428571428573,0.23242424242424242,0.538080808080808,1

208,208,A Framework for Multiaccess Support for Unreliable Internet Traffic using Multipath DCCP,"Mobile nodes are typically equipped with multiple radios and can connect to multiple radio access networks (e.g. WiFi, LTE and 5G). Consequently, it is important to design mechanisms that efficiently manage multiple network interfaces for aggregating the capacity, steering of traffic flows or switching flows among multiple interfaces. While such multi-access solutions have the potential to increase the overall traffic throughput and communication reliability, the variable latencies on different access links introduce packet delay variation which has negative effect on the application quality of service and user quality of experience. In this paper, we present a new IP-compatible multipath framework for heterogeneous access networks. The framework uses Multipath Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (MP-DCCP) - a set of extensions to regular DCCP - to enable a transport connection to operate across multiple access networks, simultaneously. We present the design of the new protocol framework and show simulation and experimental testbed results that (1) demonstrate the operation of the new framework, and (2) demonstrate the ability of our solution to manage significant packet delay variation caused by the asymmetry of network paths, by applying pluggable packet scheduling or reordering algorithms.",60033387,University of London,London,United Kingdom,"['1705', '1708']",26.857142857142858,0.04087121212121212,0.335777972027972,1

Cloaking poses significant challenges in detection of malicious web sites. The challenge arises due to its simplicity in implementation and its effectiveness in bypassing the detection engines. A malicious web site can deliver a benign content to a requesting client on the server side and consequently bypass detection, regardless of the detection engine used by the client. We performed large-scale real-world experiments to study cloaking techniques used by malicious web sites. We focused our research on malicious web sites using geographical information associated and derived from the IP address and language preferences of a visiting client's browser. Our study validated our hypothesis that client browser's preferred language settings and geographical information of an IP address taken in isolation, change the behaviour of a malicious web site.

210,210,A MAC protocol with dynamic allocation of time slots based on traffic priority in wireless body area networks,"In a wireless body area network (WBAN), wireless biomedical sensors are placed around, on, or inside the human body. Given specific requirements, WBANs can significantly improve healthcare, diagnostic monitoring, and other medical services. However, the existing standards such as IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 have some limitations to meet all the requirements of WBANs. Many medium access control (MAC) protocols have been studied so far, most of which are derived from the IEEE 802.15.4 superframe structure with some improvements and adjustments. However, the MAC protocols do not provide the required quality of service (QoS) for various types of traffic in a WBAN. In this paper, a traffic-aware MAC (TA-MAC) protocol for WBANs is proposed, in which time slots are dynamically allocated on the basis of traffic priority, providing the required QoS. According to the performance evaluation results, the proposed TA-MAC is better than IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and the conventional priority-based MAC in terms of transmission time, system throughput, energy efficiency, and collision ratio.",60009950,Chosun University,Gwangju,South Korea,"['1708', '1705']",23.285714285714285,0.14226190476190478,0.444345238095238,1

212,212,Interpolation Algorithm for High-Speed Processing of Complex Curvilinear Trajectories,"The rising popularity of complex product design leads to frequent use of curvilinear toolpaths during machining. Along with growing accuracy requirements for processing the complication of part geometry leads to the importance of developing efficient interpolation methods for processing along complex toolpaths. In this case, to obtain an online interpolation algorithm for complex trajectories the combination methods, such as the use of parametric curve representation for complex paths, approximation into equal linear segments during interpolation and application of curve on trajectory corners, is considered. The paper contains the description and analysis of the developed interpolation algorithm for complex trajectories. The proposed curve approximation into equal segments allows to achieve constant speed and minimal contour error. The comparison between the conventional and proposed segmentation methods have been obtained via simulation and analyzed in the present paper. The developed algorithm allows to significantly reduce the segment length and velocity deviations. The application of an acceleration/deceleration control with S-shape feedrate profile for curve interpolation is also described in the paper. The proposed method allows the calculation of an optimal parameter increment with low computational load, and thus can be applied to real-time machining.",60072485,"Saint Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics University ITMO",Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,['1700'],21.11111111111111,-0.06281512605042017,0.3744397759103641,1

214,214,Computer Simulation of a Smart Building,"Abstract: Smart Building is a technology that is on the rise in developed countries. The idea behind it is that a smart building should be able to recognize a variety of situations in itself and respond accordingly. An automated building management system is set up to automate the controls and to coordinate the separate building engineering systems; the system comprises subsystems to automate this or that segment of the equipment. Mathematical modeling and computer simulation is necessary to study the various modes, in which the engineering subsystems and the system as a whole may operate. From the mathematical standpoint, a smart building is a continuous-discrete or hybrid system that comprises multiple coordinated components of varying nature that can be described as continuous or discrete processes. This paper proposes a smart building model that can simulate the functioning of the core engineering subsystems as well as the algorithms behind them. The model is based on Matlab Simulink and uses the Simscape physical modeling library as well as the Stateflow library.

215,215,On Safety of Unary and Nonunary IFP Operators,"Abstract—: The article investigates the safety of unary inflationary fixed point operators (IFP-operators), i.e., their computability in finitely many steps. Such operators correspond exactly to recursive SQL queries. Therefore, the problem under investigation is directly related to database theory. The problem arises from the fact that if recursion and universe relations, e.g., addition, are simultaneously used in a SQL query, then a query evaluation can fall into an infinite loop. Moreover, such a combination makes it possible to model a universal computing device, e.g., a Turing machine. Hence, the problem of finite computability for such SQL queries is undecidable. In our previous works, we established some properties of a universe those guarantee the finite computability of any IFP-operator in the universe. In this article, we investigate a connection between an arity of IFP-operators and their safety. The main result of this article is that some results for general IFP-operators do not hold for unary ones. An instance of a universe is constructed in which all unnested unary IFP-operators are safe. However, there are unsafe binary IFP-operators in this universe. Therefore, IFP-operators can become unsafe if the arity changes. In addition, there are unsafe nested unary operators. This contrasts with the general case in which this is impossible. There are also elementary equivalent universes where the same unary IFP-operators are unsafe. This behavior is also different from the behavior of general IFP-operators.",60025503,Tverskoj Gosudarstvennyj Universitet,Tver,Russia,"['1712', '1711']",14.4375,0.05964912280701754,0.47236842105263155,1

Many algorithms have been developed to detect manipulated images, but few have investigated the ability of deep neural network based approaches to verify the authenticity of image labels, such as event names. In this paper, we propose several novel methods to predict if an image was captured at one of several noteworthy events. We use a set of images from several recorded events such as storms, marathons, protests, and other large public gatherings. Two strategies of applying pre-trained Imagenet network for event verification are presented, with two modifications for each strategy. The first method uses the features from the last convolutional layer of a pre-trained network as input to a classifier. We also consider the effects of tuning the convolutional weights of the pre-trained network to improve classification. The second method combines many features extracted from smaller scales and uses the output of a pre-trained network as the input to a second classifier. For both methods, we investigated several different classifiers and tested many different pre-trained networks. Our experiments demonstrate both these approaches are effective for event verification and image re-purposing detection.

220,220,How U.S. and canadian universities and colleges dealt with malware and ransomware attacks in 2016-2017," All rights reserved.In February 2016, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center’s network was brought to a standstill for over a week as the hospital IT team worked diligently to recover from a ransomware attack. During the attack, hospital administrators declared an internal state of emergency as medical staff struggled—without success—to access patient records and critical computer systems critical to maintain adequate patient care. Because of these issues, some patients were transported to other functioning hospitals. The affected hospital’s computer systems were literally held hostage until a ransom of 40 Bitcoins—approximately $17.00 —was paid. Only then could the targeted hospital regain control and its files—encrypted by malware. Since this 2016 incident, at least three more healthcare organizations in the United States publicly reported operational disruptions due to crippling ransomware attacks. (LogRythm 2017). Add to the ransomware attack mix small, medium, and large businesses, government offices, educational post-secondary institutions, and financial institutions during this time period and it becomes understandable why the Institute of Critical Infrastructure Technology dubbed 2016 “the year ransomware will hold America hostage.” (LogRhythm 2017).

226,226,A Novel Genetic Algorithm Selection Method and Implementation in IoT Domain,"In Internet of Things (IoT) domain, there are many NP-hard problems that are required to be solved efficiently by some meta-heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm. There are many genetic algorithm selection methods which aim to find the optimal chromosome by populating and varying them by some mutation and cross-over methodologies. Most of these algorithms process all of the genes of chromosomes into fitness function to decide whether to pass them to new generation or to apply some genetic operations or to abandon them. If chromosomes are ultimately long or fitness functions are difficult to compute, it will have a great overhead and will consume so much time. In this paper, a novel genetic algorithm selection method is proposed and promises some intelligence to keep these processes short and efficient by taking some remarkable risks. It is based on analogy of a football league with multiple groups and it uses the idea of partially processing the chromosome genes after adopting a decision mechanism based on Bayesian game theory.

227,227,Learning combinatorial embedding networks for deep graph matching,"Graph matching refers to finding node correspondence between graphs, such that the corresponding node and edge's affinity can be maximized. In addition with its NP-completeness nature, another important challenge is effective modeling of the node-wise and structure-wise affinity across graphs and the resulting objective, to guide the matching procedure effectively finding the true matching against noises. To this end, this paper devises an end-to-end differentiable deep network pipeline to learn the affinity for graph matching. It involves a supervised permutation loss regarding with node correspondence to capture the combinatorial nature for graph matching. Meanwhile deep graph embedding models are adopted to parameterize both intra-graph and cross-graph affinity functions, instead of the traditional shallow and simple parametric forms e.g. a Gaussian kernel. The embedding can also effectively capture the higher-order structure beyond second-order edges. The permutation loss model is agnostic to the number of nodes, and the embedding model is shared among nodes such that the network allows for varying numbers of nodes in graphs for training and inference. Moreover, our network is class-agnostic with some generalization capability across different categories. All these features are welcomed for real-world applications.

By fusing depth with edge and colour features, a stereo tracking algorithm named scalable and occlusionaware multi-cues correlation filter tracker (SOMCFT) is proposed in this paper, which consists of multi-cue correlation filter tracker (MCFT), scale handling and occlusion-aware strategy. In MCFT, the confidence maps drawn from all the features are filtered by each other, and then an optimal confidence map is determined by minimizing the sum of Kullback-Leibler divergence. In scale handling, the target is segmented by 2D grey-depth histograms, and then a quantized set is used to guide the scale variants of bounding boxes. In occlusion-aware strategy, the start and end of occlusion is detected by combining the changes of depth and the results of MCFT; meanwhile, a reasonable candidate region is determined during occlusion. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the stereo tracking dataset demonstrate that the proposed SOMCFT algorithm performs favourably when compared with other methods.

229,229,Gaze Training by Modulated Dropout Improves Imitation Learning,"Imitation learning by behavioral cloning is a prevalent method that has achieved some success in vision-based autonomous driving. The basic idea behind behavioral cloning is to have the neural network learn from observing a human expert's behavior. Typically, a convolutional neural network learns to predict the steering commands from raw driver-view images by mimicking the behaviors of human drivers. However, there are other cues, such as gaze behavior, available from human drivers that have yet to be exploited. Previous researches have shown that novice human learners can benefit from observing experts' gaze patterns. We present here that deep neural networks can also profit from this. We propose a method, gaze-modulated dropout, for integrating this gaze information into a deep driving network implicitly rather than as an additional input. Our experimental results demonstrate that gaze-modulated dropout enhances the generalization capability of the network to unseen scenes. Prediction error in steering commands is reduced by 23.5% compared to uniform dropout. Running closed loop in the simulator, the gaze-modulated dropout net increased the average distance travelled between infractions by 58.5%.

Per-packet multipath routing algorithms report better performance than their Per-flow counterparts. However, per-packet multipath routing algorithms are rarely used in practice due their negative impact on connection oriented protocols, such as TCP.

In particular, the scheme is built to deal with oscillations of the load voltage. The oscillations that are a result of the taking-over of the hyperbolic characteristic of the equation are corrected by a high order relaxed FDTD method and a regularizing effect of Runge Kutta.

Two of these systems are genetic algorithms (GAs) and neural networks (NNs). A special type of NN is Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). ELM is a single hidden layer feedforward NN, in which the training step is done in just one step. Even if the hidden-output weights are analytically computed, studies have shown that the ELM still maintains the universal approximation capability. In the classical ELM the input-hidden weights are randomly generated. This paper deals with the evolutionary training of an ELM, by using a GA routine to set the input weights.

234,234,A Taxonomy of Situations within the Context of Risk Analysis,"Prediction of deliberate human decisions with potential negative impact on others would have great practical and scientific utility. The Conflicting Incentives Risk Analysis (CIRA) method defines risk as a result of misaligned incentives between various stakeholders. The method makes predictions based on action desirability from the perspective of the individual in the position to implement the action. Therefore, in order to assess action desirability it is necessary to characterize stakeholders and their perceptions about the situation as well. While classification systems and taxonomies related to stakeholder attributes are well-established, systematic classifications of situational aspects are underdeveloped in the literature. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to present a classification of situational variables in the form of a taxonomy capturing key situational features that exert influence on decision-makers. The development of the taxonomy begins with mapping two major types of risks distinguished in the CIRA method to relevant psychological constructs. The principled, systematic development of dilemmas enabled by the taxonomy allows researchers to investigate the predictability of stakeholder behavior which may result in various types of risks. The taxonomy is extensible, thus additional concepts and variables can be included depending on the needs of the analysis and according to future developments within the fields of psychology and information security.",60013141,Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet,Trondheim,Norway,['1700'],23.333333333333332,0.07145833333333333,0.42041666666666666,1

Conventional firewalls cannot protect Virtual Machines (VMs) because the communication between them runs only within the virtualization server/host. Thus, virtualized systems represent blind spots for network monitoring. They are particularly susceptible to attacks on the data link and network layers (L2/L3 attacks).

This kind of bionic leg needs only one driving motor mounted directly on the robot body, which can transform the continuous rotation of the motor to the back-and-forth swinging of the leg. Taking Jansen linkage as an example, through the theoretical analysis, virtual prototype function simulation and the performance test of the physical prototype, we realize the functions of walking, turning and climbing. To overcome the shortcomings of Jansen linkage, such as the singleness of foot motion trajectory and poor terrain adaptability, the system optimization and innovation design of the Jansen-linkage mechanism are carried out. The improved mechanism not only inherits the original advantages of Jansen linkage but also promotes the ability of obstacle crossing.

In this paper different ways of encryption technique has been suggested, which is slightly robust against attack in terms of avalanche effect by modifying AES, which uses two different S-boxes alternatively because security of a cipher is centralized on the usage of s-box.

240,240,Asymptotic Integration of Certain Differential Equations in Banach Space,"Abstract: In this work, we investigate the problem of constructing asymptotic representations for weak solutions of a certain class of linear differential equations in the Banach space as an independent variable tends to infinity. We consider the class of equations that represent a perturbation of a linear autonomous equation, in general, with an unbounded operator. The perturbation takes the form of a family of bounded operators that, in a sense, oscillatorally decreases at infinity. It is assumed that the unperturbed equation satisfies the standard requirements of the center manifold theory. The essence of the proposed asymptotic integration method is to prove the existence of a center-like manifold (a critical manifold) for the initial equation. This manifold is positively invariant with respect to the initial equation and attracts all trajectories of the weak solutions. The dynamics of the initial equation on the critical manifold is described by the finite-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. The asymptotics of the fundamental matrix of this system can be constructed by using the method developed by P.N. Nesterov for asymptotic integration of systems with oscillatory decreasing coefficients. We illustrate the proposed technique by constructing the asymptotic representations for solutions of the perturbed heat equation.",60001420,Yaroslavl State University,Yaroslavl,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",19.9,-0.006777597402597401,0.3869926948051948,1

We use the principal components of a large dataset of BRDFs to reconstruct a full BRDF table from a sparse input of BRDF values at pairs of incoming and outgoing light directions. To get visual user input, we allow the user to provide their own object and then generate guide images with selected lighting directions. Once the user shades the guide images, we construct the reflectance table and allow the user to iteratively refine the material appearance.

The proposed token allows sharing an address validation between the QUIC server and trusted entities issuing these tokens. This saves a round-trip time for the address validation. Furthermore, we propose distribution mechanisms for these tokens using DNS resolvers and QUIC connections to other hostnames.

244,244,Face skin tone adaptive automatic exposure control,"In face-priority automatic exposure control in digital camera systems, exposure adjustment is typically made irrespective of the face skin tone, i.e. how dark or bright the face is. As a result, a face can become over exposed when it is present against a very dark background, or become under exposed when it is present against a very bright background, depending on the face skin tone and scene content. Adapting the exposure control to the face skin tone will result in well-exposed faces in various capture scenarios, and hence better image quality. This paper presents a novel face skin tone adaptive automatic exposure control solution. Using a well-trained neural network based face skin tone predictor, the likelihoods of dark and bright face skin tones are calculated. An algorithm adjusts the bounds of the target brightness of the exposure control based on the face skin tone likelihoods and a set of configuration parameters. The face skin tone adaptive brightness bounds then guide the frame exposure adjustment. Experimental results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed solution over conventional exposure control that does not take into account the face skin tone information.",60033010,Intel Corporation,Santa Clara,United States,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",20.88888888888889,0.15039115646258508,0.4412244897959184,1

A proxy for detectability, the minimization of distortion plays a critical role in producing good stego objects. STCs have become the tool of choice for many steganographers, because they approach the theoretical bound for embedding performance in quasi-linear time, for arbitrary length covers and payloads. However, until recently little attention has been paid to how closely STCs realize optimal change probabilities, particularly near the start and end of the embedding path. Recent work by Köhler et al, aimed to modify the parity-check matrix used by STCs to produce change vectors with change probabilities closer to the optimal probabilities. However, there is a cost of reduced capacity, or increased distortion. This paper demonstrates a modification to the block-structured STC parity-check matrix that both achieves changes closer to the optimal probabilities, and can be used for arbitrary length covers, and payloads.",60026851,University of Oxford,Oxford,United Kingdom,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",23.857142857142858,0.10138888888888889,0.4833333333333333,1

Each translation of the polysemous word is compared against word embeddings of translated surrounding words to calculate word similarity scores and the most similar word to vectors of translated surrounding words is selected as the correct translation.

Adaptive background estimation is an alternative to temporal frame differencing that relies on building and maintaining statistical models describing background pixel behavior; however, it requires careful tuning of a learning rate parameter that controls the rate at which the model is updated. We propose an algorithm for statistical background modeling that selectively updates the model based on the previously detected foreground.

257,257,Exploring the limitations of behavior cloning for autonomous driving,"Driving requires reacting to a wide variety of complex environment conditions and agent behaviors. Explicitly modeling each possible scenario is unrealistic. In contrast, imitation learning can, in theory, leverage data from large fleets of human-driven cars. Behavior cloning in particular has been successfully used to learn simple visuomotor policies end-to-end, but scaling to the full spectrum of driving behaviors remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark to experimentally investigate the scalability and limitations of behavior cloning. We show that behavior cloning leads to state-of-the-art results, executing complex lateral and longitudinal maneuvers, even in unseen environments, without being explicitly programmed to do so. However, we confirm some limitations of the behavior cloning approach: Some well-known limitations (e.g., dataset bias and overfitting), new generalization issues (e.g., dynamic objects and the lack of a causal modeling), and training instabilities, all requiring further research before behavior cloning can graduate to real-world driving.

Recently, vision-based SLAM approach has become the research hot spot. There are some disadvantages of the general vision-based SLAM algorithm such as the higher computational requirements and the lower accuracy than the probability-based SLAM method. To deal with these problems, an improved vision-based SLAM approach is proposed based on the RatSLAM method, which is inspired from animal spatial cognition. In the proposed approach, a local search strategy is used to improve the real-time performance of the general RatSLAM method. In order to get a more accurate map, a prediction strategy is added to the general RatSLAM method, then the robot can predict the next possible view or position, which can reduce the effects of the noise and accumulated error on the SLAM method. In addition, a concept of the short-term memory map is introduced into the proposed SLAM method, to solve the kidnap recovery problems.

In particular, the analysis of the underground-to-aboveground (UG2AG) link quality is crucial for the practical realization and deployment of WUSNs. Recently, LoRa, as one of the low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) technologies, has attracted substantial attentions for its unique advantages such as the low power consumption and long-range capability. However, to the best of our knowledge, its performance has not yet been quantitatively analyzed for LoRa-based WUSNs. In this paper, a preliminary evaluation of the LoRa's capability of serving a UG2AG channel are presented at various burial depths in two challenging media, i.e., attenuative soils and water. We experimentally analyze the influence of various physical layer (PHY) parameters, e.g., spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (BW), and coding rate (CR) on the LoRa's propagation performance in the field. The results reveal that the reliable UG2AG communication link (without packet loss) can be established at an internode distance greater than 50m when the LoRa device is buried 0.4m deep, even in soils with relatively high volumetric water content (VWC). Our field results successfully verify the theoretical model for the UG2AG channel. These results may have a significant impact on the deployment of LoRa-based WUSNs with the potential applications in underground utilities monitoring.",60073652,Tongji University,Shanghai,China,"['1705', '1708']",25.333333333333332,0.21555555555555558,0.5471995464852607,1
260,260,Selection of construction waste using sensor fusion,"In recent years, buildings in urban areas are frequently being demolished for a variety of reasons. For example, demolitions happen when buildings are rebuilt because the building was sold during an asset sale by a corporation in financial difficulties, because the building was built during the period of high economic growth and was aging, or because the building was damaged in a natural disaster, which happens frequently in recent years. However, construction waste is still being sorted by hand. Therefore, it is desired to reduce labor costs and to improve safety of workers. In order to overcome these issues, this study investigated methods for automatically recognizing waste materials. However, these methods had several problems, such as low recognition accuracy and an inability to handle metals, such as iron. In this research, we propose a method for automatically recognizing waste materials using sensor fusion. In the proposed method, information regarding the color, brightness, and shape of the object is acquired from images obtained using imaging sensors. In addition, we also focus on differences in the thermal conductivity of different materials and use a thermal sensor to measure the temperature of the target object to obtain thermal information. We performed a material recognition experiment in which only camera images were used, and a material recognition experiment in which sensor fusion was used. The results show that the recognition accuracy was approximately 10% higher overall in the experiment conducted using the latter method compared to the experiment conducted using the former method. These results show that the proposed method is effective.",60009824,Tokyo City University,Tokyo,Japan,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",21.5,0.017826086956521738,0.2930434782608695,1
261,261,A visual servo control system combining parallel structure with dual-lens zoom," All rights reserved.Currently, visual servoing is increasingly used in daily life. The task of visual servoing is first to capture pose by a mono camera and then to acquire the expected pose by calculating the joints velocities of serial structure. However, the pose obtained in this way is not accurate enough, and there may exist some singular points. Therefore, a visual servo control system that integrates parallel structure with a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens is proposed. For the visual part, the detection and tracking can be achieved by the wide-angle lens. And to present higher definition images of the target, continuous zoom is realized by the dual lens which can be adjusted according to the distance between the target and the camera. In the servo part, visual servo control is accomplished by the looking-up table and triangle-plane smooth method. Furthermore, the system has been verified by relevant experiments based on a parallel prototype machine. The results show that high-definition images can be obtained by continuous zoom with a dual lens, and the parallel structure model is feasible. Additionally, the control strategy is more accurate and in good robustness as it can reduce measurement errors.",60029306,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,"['1712', '1702']",19.7,0.13333333333333333,0.2857142857142857,0
262,262,Detasyr: Decentralized Ticket-based Authorization with Sybil Resistance,"A frequent problem of Internet services are Sybil attacks, i.e., malicious users create numerous fake identities for themselves. To avoid this, many services employ obstacles like Captchas to force (potentially malicious) users to invest human attention in creating new identities for the service. However, this only makes it more difficult but not impossible to create fake identities. Sybil attacks are especially encountered as a problem in decentralized systems since no single trust anchor is available to judge new users as honest or malicious. The avoidance of a single centralized trust-anchor, however, is desirable in many cases. As a consequence, various decentralized Sybil detection approaches have been proposed. The most promising ones are based on leveraging the trust relationships embedded within social graphs. While most of these approaches are focusing on detecting large existing groups of Sybil identities, our approach Detasyr instead restricts the creation of numerous Sybil identities. For that, tickets are distributed through the social graph and have to be collected, allowing for decentralized and privacy preserving authorization. Additionally, it offers a proof of authorization to users that are considered to be honest, allowing them to display their authorization towards others.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,"['1705', '1708']",19.2,0.12670995670995672,0.5333189033189033,1
263,263,Building Individual Educational Routes for Learning SQL Queries,"Due to how prevalent the usage of database technologies is in everyday life and related professional fields, the insufficient qualifications of specialists in relevant positions becomes an issue. The aim of this paper is to show the importance of forming individual educational routes as a factor influencing the effectiveness of training and the ability of a specialist to develop skills in professional activities. In learning SQL queries, repeatedly performing typical tasks, seeing the results, and adjusting queries accordingly, is necessary. Therefore, computer training simulators can be considered the most effective tool for learning SQL queries. This paper proposes a method for building an individual educational route for fulfilling tasks meant to train professional skills in compiling SQL queries. The task and learner models are described within the method. The A∗ algorithm is modified based on the proposed models, and the conditions of using it for creating an optimal individual educational route are described.

In this paper, we present OPPLOAD, a novel framework for offloading computational workflows in opportunistic networks. The individual tasks forming a workflow can be assigned to particular remote execution platforms (workers) either preselected ahead of time or decided just in time where a matching worker will automatically be assigned for the next task.

265,265,Building a Data Store with the Dynamic Structure,"Abstract: This article presents the analysis of approaches to data warehouse construction based on relational and NoSQL solutions and lists the limitations of the relational approach to data mining. The contradiction between data presentation in the real subject domain and the model of data presentation in the relational and NoSQL approaches is revealed. The revealed contradiction is related to the temporality of the values of individual data attributes, the variability of the composition of these attributes, and structure of connections between them. A new logical model of the data warehouse with dynamic structure is proposed. The model is based on the concept of the object as a container for properties storage. Each property of the object includes the property name and two property values—without reference and with reference, that are relevant at a given time. The reference property value points to an object whose name is interpreted as the value of the property at a given time. A formal description of the model with allocation of the necessary functionality to manipulate objects and their properties (selectors, predicates, constructors) is given and the necessary control structures are introduced. Substantiation of the proposed model, called an OP-model is given on the basis of compliance with the logical ER data model. It is proved that any ER data model can be implemented in the OP-model. At the same time, the advantages of the OP-model are indicated, they are associated with the possibility of changing connections between entities due to changes in the reference value at a particular time. The potential for scalability of data warehouse due to the unique identification of each object is noted.",123989156,Federal State Budgetary Scientific Institution “Gosmetodcentr,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",22.666666666666668,0.06737689393939394,0.5330965909090909,1

The algorithm searches for a path with a short path length and high safety, while being computationally efficient. The A∗ algorithm is operated on a probabilistic costmap which incorporates the uncertainties in the vision and mapping algorithms. To trade off between computation time and path cost, we used the A∗∈ algorithm, which operates in higher resolutions (of actions considered in expansions). The algorithm is then extended to incorporate uncertainties in the costmap, which represents the information about the environment in the form of a probability distribution. To make the A∗ algorithm compatible with a probabilistic costmap, we used the R∗δ algorithm.

269,269,Real-Time Bidding with Soft Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning in Display Advertising,"The main task of advertising companies is to sell goods and services interesting to the user. Online auctions are the main mechanism for selecting ads to the user. Dynamic bidding allows advertiser to automatically calculate the bid that is profitable to set to maximize goals (for example, the number of clicks on an ad), depending on the user who sees the ad. In this case the advertiser must specify the budget of the ad and the optimization goal. During the advertising campaign the bid for each impression will be calculated by a special algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for calculating the dynamic bid for each impression of the ad in order to maximize the advertiser's goals, which takes into account settings of the advertising campaign, budget, the ad lifetime and other parameters. This task is formulated as reinforcement learning problem, where states are the status of auction and parameters of the advertising campaign, the actions are bidding for each ad based on the input state. Every ad has an agent who observes the states all the time and calculates the bid for the impression. We evaluated the proposed model on real advertising campaigns in a large social network.

The path of the robot contains an unknown number of both static and moving obstacles that get in its way. To simulate the use of real sensors, the implementation uses only local information available within a predefined radius for decisionmaking. To address this problem, feature ranking is introduced, where the top k obstacles are taken into consideration in planning the robot path. Feature ranking is applied to linear regression and neural networks to compare their generalization ability against a baseline policy. During the development of the system, the robot undergoes a learning phase, where the moving obstacles move at 50% of the robot's speed. When learning phase is complete, the generalization ability of the policy learned by both algorithms is tested by generating environments with various obstacle speeds. The results show that the policy developed performs much better than the baseline policy with the neural network outperforming linear regression in the majority of the environments.",60056335,Princess Sumaya University,Amman,Jordan,"['1712', '1702']",23.0,0.1366666666666667,0.36,0
271,271,An Intelligent Method for Comparing Shapes of Three-Dimensional Objects,"The article discusses a method for comparing the shape of three-dimensional objects, which was developed at the Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University. The main method is the consecutive double conversion of the original three-dimensional object to a vector of parameters that are invariant to the initial position, rotation, and size of the explored object. At the first step, three-dimensional objects are transformed by a three-dimensional version of the chord method into a matrix of distances between random points on the surface of the object. Then the matrix is converted into a vector that forms a histogram of distances. The resulting vector is summed up with additional indicators and compared in pairs with objects stored in the database using the Siamese neural network, which at the output gives an estimate for the proximity of the three-dimensional objects' shape. The developed method is the basis of a system for comparing the shape of three-dimensional industrial designs, and is also used in the detection of cancer of the lungs and prostate gland.",60017103,Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,St. Petersburg,Russian Federation,['1700'],24.428571428571427,0.14351851851851852,0.36296296296296293,1
272,272,Synthesis of Control and State Observer for Weakly Nonlinear Systems Based on the Pseudo-Linearization Technique,"Abstract: In this paper an approach for the construction of nonlinear output tracking control on a finite time interval for a class of weakly nonlinear systems with state-dependent coefficients is considered. The proposed method of control synthesis consists of two main stages. On the first stage, a nonlinear state feedback regulator is constructed using a previously proposed control algorithm based on the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE). On the second stage, the problem of full-order observer construction is formulated and then is reduced to the differential game problem. The form of its solution is obtained with the help of the guaranteed (minimax) control principle, which allows to find the best observer coefficients with respect to a given functional considering the worst-case uncertainty realization. The form of the obtained equations made it possible to use the algorithm from the first stage to determine the observer matrix. The proposed approach is characterized by the nonapplicability of the estimation and control separation principle used for linear systems, since the matrix of observer coefficients turned out to be dependent on the feedback coefficients matrix. The use of numerical-analytical procedures for determination of observer and feedback coefficients matrices significantly reduces the computational complexity of the control algorithm.",60110808,Institute for Systems Analysis of Russian Academy of Sciences,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",25.125,0.11000000000000001,0.4366666666666667,1
273,273,Ensemble Modeling Method to Predict Life Expectancy of Population in High-Income Countries: Japan and Finland,"Life expectancy at birth is an indicator defined by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) as the number of years, on average, an infant is expected to live. This indicator is a proxy of good health. The health index together with the education and income indices are used by UNDP for measuring the development level of the member countries. In addition to improve human development along the health dimension, most governments also need the accurate projection of life expectancy of their populations for the effective social services and decent pension planning. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling method to predict life expectancy. Our method is based on the ensemble scheme in which a combination of classification and regression tree (CART) and the chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) algorithms are applied for making a cooperative prediction. We empirically prove that the proposed ensemble scheme is more accurate than a single model prediction. We experiment our modeling methodology with the life expectancy data of the two high-income countries: Japan and Finland. This selection is due to the fact that these two countries are in the group of very high human development according to the latest UNDP ranking report. The CART and CHAID models reveal that both economic and environmental factors share their contributions to forecasting life expectancy of populations in the two countries. Forest depletion, agricultural methane and CO2 emissions, particulate emission damage, national income, and education expenditure are factors affecting longevity of Japanese population. To predict the Finn's life expectancy, the ensembled models consider several factors including exports and imports of goods and services, electric power consumption, energy use, national income, GDP growth, education expenditure, forest area, agricultural methane emission, and particulate emission damage.",60026326,Suranaree University of Technology,Nakhon Ratchasima,Thailand,['1700'],23.75,0.19037786023500308,0.3995850340136054,1
274,274,Platform-Independent Specification and Verification of the Standard Mathematical Square Root Function,"Abstract: The aim of the Platform-Independent Approach to Formal Specification and Verification of Standard Mathematical Functions project is the development of an incremental combined approach to specification and verification of standard mathematical functions like sqrt, cos, sin, etc. The term “platform-independence” means that we attempt to design a relatively simple axiomatization of computer arithmetic in terms of real arithmetic (i.e., the arithmetic of the field ℝ of real numbers), but do not specify either the base of the computer arithmetic or the format of the representation of numbers. The incrementality means that we start with the most straightforward specification of the simplest algorithm in real numbers and finish with a realistic specification and a verification of the algorithm in computer arithmetic. We call our approach combined because we start with consideration of a “basic” case, the manual (pen-and-paper) verification of the algorithm in real numbers, then use this verification as proof-outlines for the manual verification of the algorithm in computer arithmetic, and finish with a computer-aided validation of the manual proofs with a proof-assistant system to avoid appeals to “obviousness” that are common in human-carried proofs. In the paper, we apply our platform-independent incremental combined approach to specification and verification of the standard mathematical square root function. By now, the computer-aided validation of the developed algorithms has been carried out only partially to prove, using the ACL2 system, the correctness (consistency) of our fixed-point arithmetic and the existence of a look-up table with the initial approximations of the square roots for fixed-point numbers.",60105869,Innopolis University,Kazan,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",42.166666666666664,0.03531746031746032,0.2852607709750567,1

With limited information, we explore how the location of devices can be estimated through the use of force-directed graphs augmented with specific domain knowledge. By looking at different indoor testbeds and challenging simulated scenarios, we investigate to what extent we can infer the correct positioning. We discuss the assumptions that needed to be made, thus exploring to what extent our approach can be employed in practice.

278,278,DeepGCNs: Can GCNs go as deep as CNNs?,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve impressive performance in a wide variety of fields. Their success benefited from a massive boost when very deep CNN models were able to be reliably trained. Despite their merits, CNNs fail to properly address problems with non-Euclidean data. To overcome this challenge, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) build graphs to represent non-Euclidean data, borrow concepts from CNNs, and apply them in training. GCNs show promising results, but they are usually limited to very shallow models due to the vanishing gradient problem. As a result, most state-of-the-art GCN models are no deeper than 3 or 4 layers. In this work, we present new ways to successfully train very deep GCNs. We do this by borrowing concepts from CNNs, specifically residual/dense connections and dilated convolutions, and adapting them to GCN architectures. Extensive experiments show the positive effect of these deep GCN frameworks. Finally, we use these new concepts to build a very deep 56-layer GCN, and show how it significantly boosts performance (+3.7% mIoU over state-of-the-art) in the task of point cloud semantic segmentation.

To overcome the constraints of RSTP, while keeping its advantages, we propose to combine the fast and proven reconfiguration mechanisms of RSTP with the shortest path capabilities and load balancing of ARP-Path bridging in the same device. The combined bridges are self-configuring and allow full miscibility of combined bridges in legacy RSTP networks.

282,282,Autofocus by deep reinforcement learning,"In recent years, smartphones have become the primary device for day-to-day photography. Therefore, it is critical for mobile imaging to capture sharp images automatically without human intervention. In this paper, we formulate autofocus as a decision-making process, in which the travel distance of a lens is determined from the phase data obtained from the phase sensors of a smartphone, and the decision-making policy is based on reinforcement learning, a popular technique in the field of deep learning. We propose to use a noise-tolerant reward function to combat the noise of the phase data.

While Zcash's anonymity is part of a rigorous scientific discussion, information on the underlying peer-to-peer network are missing. In this paper, we provide the first long-term measurement study of the Zcash network to capture key metrics such as the network size and node distribution as well as deeper insights on the centralization of the network. Furthermore, we present an inference method based on a timing analysis of block arrivals that we use to determine interconnections of nodes. We evaluate and verify our method through simulations and real-world experiments, yielding a precision of 50% with a recall of 82% in the real-world scenario.

284,284,Adaptive Chirikov Map for Pseudo-random Number Generation in Chaos-based Stream Encryption,"Information security plays an important role in modern technologies. Stream encryption is one of the common tools used for secure communications. The stream encryption algorithms require sequence with pseudo-random properties. The chaotic maps as a source of pseudo-random numbers with desired statistical properties is widely studied in the last decades. One of the known problems of the implementation of the chaos-based pseudo-random number generators implemented with low-precision arithmetic is a short period length. A possible solution of the short-cycle problem is a perturbation of the orbit or the nonlinearity parameter of the chaotic map for breaking out the cycle. In the present article, we propose a new approach for increasing the cycle length by changing the symmetry coefficient of the adaptive Chirikov map. We switch two values of the symmetry coefficient according to the output of the linear feedback shift register. We calculate the estimations of the period length for the perturbed and original Chirikov maps and confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach. Properties verification for the output sequences of generators based on the adaptive Cirikov map is carried out using correlation analysis methods and the NIST statistical test suite. The obtained results can be used in cryptography applications as well as in secure communication systems design.",60010355,Sankt-Peterburgskij Gosudarstvennyj Elektrotehniceskij Universitet,Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,['1700'],18.90909090909091,0.12594696969696972,0.49760101010101,1

286,286,Real-Time 3D volumetric human body reconstruction from a single view RGB-D capture device," Nevertheless, capturing the world in 3D is not an easy task, with capture systems being usually composed by arrays of image sensors, which sometimes are paired with depth sensors. Unfortunately, these arrays are not easy to assembly and calibrate by non-specialists, making their use in volumetric video applications a challenge. Additionally, the cost of these systems is still high, which limits their popularity in mainstream communication applications. This work proposes a system that provides a way to reconstruct the head of a human speaker from single view frames captured using a single RGB-D camera (e.g. Microsoft's Kinect 2 device). The proposed system generates volumetric video frames with a minimum number of occluded and missing areas. To achieve a good quality, the system prioritizes the data corresponding to the participants' face, therefore preserving important information from speakers facial expressions. Our ultimate goal is to design an inexpensive system that can be used in volumetric video telepresence applications and even on volumetric video talk-shows broadcasting applications.",60024989,Universidade de Brasília,Brasilia,Brazil,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",20.625,0.029523809523809532,0.5104029304029305,0

Our approach relies on data provided by multiple smartphone sensors (e.g., Wi-Fi RSSI, acceleration, compass, step counter, air pressure) to predict Wi-Fi connection loss and uses Multipath TCP to dynamically switch between different connectivity modes. We train a random forest classifier and an artificial neural network on real-world sensor data collected by five smartphone users over a period of three months. The trained models are executed on smartphones to reliably predict Wi-Fi connection loss 15 seconds ahead of time, with a precision of up to 0.97 and a recall of up to 0.98. Furthermore, we present results for four DASH video streaming experiments that run on a Nexus 5 smartphone using available Wi-Fi/cellular networks.

To gain deeper insights into their own information generated by such products, a user with no data analysis expertise could collaborate with someone who does have the required knowledge and skills. To achieve such a successful collaboration, several tasks need to be completed: finding a collaborator, negotiating the terms of the collaboration, obtaining the necessary resources, analysing the data and evaluating the results of the analysis. To support the execution of these tasks, we have developed and deployed an online software platform that enables data collectors and owners to find experts and collaborate with them so they can extract additional knowledge from the self-tracking data.

290,290,Dynamic Model of Information Exchange Processes in a Peer-to-Peer Network,"Abstract—: The article considers a file distribution model in a peer-to-peer file-sharing network based on ordinary differential equations. Phase variables describing the file-sharing state are determined (in the first approximation, this is the number of users, i.e., seeders and leechers of the shared file). The factors affecting file sharing and the change in the number of peers are analyzed. The system of differential equations describing the evolution of a torrent, or a file-sharing session (FSS), i.e., the dynamic FSS evolution model, is constructed based on the analysis. The life cycle of a FSS in the file-sharing network consisting of four stages, i.e., file sharing initiation, rapid increase in the number of leechers, stabilization, and fading (for files that lose relevance over time), is considered. Each stage is characterized by its own ratio of model parameters. The parameters change over time. The process of measuring the state of real FSSs is described. An example of a trajectory corresponding to the evolution of a real FSS on a large torrent tracker is given. Next, the FSS stabilization stage characterized by parameters that are constant in the first approximation is considered. Equilibrium points of the dynamic model of the FSS evolution are investigated. Their possible number and type are described. All generic position configurations that are possible in the FSS evolution model of a peer-to-peer file-sharing network are described. Phase portraits of each configuration are presented. The impact of various administrative measures on FSS stability margin is analyzed. The ambiguity of the effect of the rating system on FSS stability is shown.

294,294,On the Expressive Power of Some Extensions of Linear Temporal Logic,"Abstract: One of the most simple models of computation suitable for representation of reactive systems behavior is a finite state transducer that operates on an input alphabet of control signals and an output alphabet of basic actions. The behavior of such a reactive system displays itself in the correspondence between the flow of control signals and sequence of basic actions performed by the system. We believe that the behavior of this kind requires more complex and expressive means of specifications than the conventional linear temporal logic (LTL). In this paper, we define a new language of formal specifications LP-LTL, which is an extension of LTL, specifically intended for describing the properties of transducer computations. In this extension, the temporal operators are parameterized by sets of words (languages) which describe flows of control signals that impact on a reactive system. Basic predicates in the LP-LTL formulas are also defined by the languages in the alphabet of basic actions; these languages describe the expected response of the system to the environmental influences. In our earlier papers, we considered a verification problem for finite state transducers with regard to specifications represented by the LP-LTL and LP-CTL formulas. It was shown that the problem is algorithmically solvable for both logics. The aim of this paper is to estimate the expressive power of LP-LTL by comparing it with some well-known logics widely used in computer science for specification of reactive systems. Two fragments were isolated in the LP-LTL: LP-1-LTL and LP-n-LTL. We discovered that the specification language of LP-1-LTL is more expressive than LTL, while the LP-n-LTL fragment has the same expressive power as the monadic second order logic S1S.

295,295,"TCP at 100 Gbit/s - Tuning, Limitations, Congestion Control","Link capacities increase at an enormous pace, with 100 Gbit/s becoming standard in data centers, campus networks, and the Internet. These ever increasing data rates are challenging since end-system performance (esp. CPU performance) cannot keep up with the growth rates.Still, the TCP protocol and today's hardware are capable of transferring 100 Gbit/s with a single sender/receiver pair. However, extensive tuning is necessary down to manual interrupt configuration and corresponding CPU core pinning for the applications. A major issue is packet loss within the receiving end-system that cannot be prevented by TCP's flow control. This, in turn, affects TCP's default congestion control that interprets the losses as congestion signal. In this paper we show how to tune end-systems that are driven at their performance limits, what data rates are feasible, where the limitations are, and discuss the impact on and by TCP's congestion control.",60102538,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,Germany,"['1705', '1708']",20.428571428571427,0.09855158730158729,0.5486507936507936,1

298,298,Inferring IoT Device Types from Network Behavior Using Unsupervised Clustering,"The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a major challenge for network administrators to monitor and manage connected devices and sensors, ranging from smart-lights to smoke-alarms and security-cameras. In addition to new device offerings, manufacturers tend to automatically perform firmware upgrade from their cloud servers to change functionalities of existing devices that are operational in the field. This makes it difficult to re-train device classification models in order to capture legitimate changes dynamically. In this paper, we develop a modular device classification architecture that allows us to dynamically accommodate legitimate changes in network IoT assets, either addition of a new device type or upgrades of existing types, without replacing the entire set of models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We identify key traffic attributes that can be obtained from flow-level network telemetry to characterize individual IoT devices. We develop an unsupervised one-class clustering method for each device to detect its normal network behavior. (2) We tune individual device-specific clustering models and use them to classify IoT devices in real-time. We enhance our classification by developing methods for automatic conflict resolution and noise filtering.

Homogeneity of a training dataset structure and its completeness are very important for minimizing inaccuracies in the development of the CAD systems. The main difficulties in the medical training data acquisition are concerned with their heterogeneity and incompleteness. Another problem is a lack of a sufficient large amount of data for training deep neural networks which are a basis of the CAD systems. In order to overcome these problems in the lung cancer CAD systems, a new methodology of the dataset acquisition is proposed by using as an example the database called LIRA which has been applied to training the intellectual lung cancer CAD system called by Dr. AIzimov. One of the important peculiarities of the dataset LIRA is the morphological confirmation of diseases.

302,302,Understanding eye movements: Psychophysics and a model of primary visual cortex,"Humans move their eyes in order to learn visual representations of the world. These eye movements depend on distinct factors, either by the scene that we perceive or by our own decisions. To select what is relevant to attend is part of our survival mechanisms and the way we build reality, as we constantly react both consciously and unconsciously to all the stimuli that is projected into our eyes. In this thesis [1] we try to explain (1) how we move our eyes, (2) how to build machines that understand visual information and deploy eye movements, and (3) how to make these machines understand tasks in order to decide for eye movements. (1)We provided the analysis of eye movement behavior elicited by low-level feature distinctiveness with a dataset of 230 synthetically-generated image patterns [2]. A total of 15 types of stimuli has been generated (e.g. orientation, brightness, color, size, etc.), with 7 feature contrasts for each feature category. Eyetracking data was collected from 34 participants during the viewing of the dataset, using Free-Viewing and Visual Search task instructions. Results showed that saliency is predominantly and distinctively influenced by: 1. feature type, 2. feature contrast, 3. temporality of fixations, 4. task difficulty and 5. center bias. From such dataset (SID4VAM), we have computed a benchmark of saliency models by testing performance using psychophysical patterns [3]. Model performance has been evaluated considering model inspiration and consistency with human psychophysics. Our study reveals that state-of-the-art Deep Learning saliency models do not perform well with synthetic pattern images, instead, models with Spectral/Fourier inspiration outperform others in saliency metrics and are more consistent with human psychophysical experimentation. (2) Computations in the primary visual cortex (area V1 or striate cortex) have long been hypothesized to be responsible, among several visual processing mechanisms, of bottom-up visual attention (also named saliency). In order to validate this hypothesis, images from eye tracking datasets have been processed with a biologically plausible model of V1 (named Neurodynamic Saliency Wavelet Model or NSWAM)[4]. Following Li's neurodynamic model, we define V1's lateral connections with a network of firing rate neurons, sensitive to visual features such as brightness, color, orientation and scale. Early subcortical processes (i.e. retinal and thalamic) are functionally simulated. The resulting saliency maps are generated from the model output, representing the neuronal activity of V1 projections towards brain areas involved in eye movement control. We want to pinpoint that our unified computational architecture is able to reproduce several visual processes (i.e. brightness, chromatic induction and visual discomfort) without applying any type of training or optimization and keeping the same parametrization. The model has been extended (NSWAMCM)[ 5] with an implementation of the cortical magnification function to define the retinotopical projections towards V1, processing neuronal activity for each distinct view during scene observation. Novel computational definitions of top-down inhibition (in terms of inhibition of return and selection mechanisms), are also proposed to predict attention in Free-Viewing and Visual Search conditions. Results show that our model outpeforms other biologically-inpired models of saliency prediction as well as to predict visual saccade sequences, specifically for nature and synthetic images. We also show how temporal and spatial characteristics of inhibition of return can improve prediction of saccades, as well as how distinct search strategies (in terms of feature-selective or category-specific inhibition) predict attention at distinct image contexts. (3) Although previous scanpath models have been able to efficiently predict saccades during Free- Viewing, it is well known that stimulus and task instructions can strongly affect eye movement patterns. In particular, task priming has been shown to be crucial to the deployment of eye movements, involving interactions between brain areas related to goal-directed behavior, working and long-term memory in combination with stimulus-driven eye movement neuronal correlates. In our latest study [6] we proposed an extension of the Selective Tuning Attentive Reference Fixation Controller Model based on task demands (STAR-FCT), describing novel computational definitions of Long-Term Memory, Visual Task Executive and Task Working Memory. With these modules we are able to use textual instructions in order to guide the model to attend to specific categories of objects and/or places in the scene. We have designed our memory model by processing a visual hierarchy of low- and high-level features. The relationship between the executive task instructions and the memory representations has been specified using a tree of semantic similarities between the learned features and the object category labels. Results reveal that by using this model, the resulting object localization maps and predicted saccades have a higher probability to fall inside the salient regions depending on the distinct task instructions compared to saliency.",60104040,Centre de Visió per Computador,Cerdanyola del Valles,Spain,"['1712', '1707']",21.166666666666668,0.14032738095238098,0.34315476190476196,1

307,307,Perceptual Image Hashing: Tolerant to Brightness and Contrast Corrections Method Based on Cumulative Histogram Slicing,"Perceptual image hashing is used in a wide range of practical applications which include content image authentication, digital watermarking, pattern recognition, computer vision and database fast duplicate image retrieval. Existing techniques are not well suited for the significant brightness and contrast corrections. The main point is that such manipulations can lead to information loss due to the histogram truncation in cases when pixel values are out of the dynamic range. In order to address the issue a novel technique is suggested. Cumulative histogram slices as a pivot for the subsequent image features calculations are used. The points of slicing are calculated in a way they are robust to content preserving manipulations such as brightness and contrast corrections. This approach allows one to handle situations when some of the content slices are lost due to the pixel value overflow. On the other hand, if one tampers image content within any existing slice it will then be detected by comparing the correspondent calculated and provided hash values. Experiment results show that the suggested method has sufficient sensitivity to detect image tampering whereas being tolerant to even significant brightness and contrast corrections. The memory consumption allows one to use the proposed method with the digital watermarking schemes.",60008859,Sankt-Peterburgskij Gosudarstvennyj Universitet Telekommunikacij imeni professora Bonch-Bruevicha,Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,['1700'],20.4,0.04583333333333333,0.3875,1
308,308,Verification-Oriented Process Ontology,"Abstract: This paper presents the ontology of the concurrent processes close to Hoare communicating sequential processes. It is a part of an intellectual system for supporting verification of behavioral properties of such processes. Our ontological representation of the processes is oriented both to the application of formal verification methods and to the extraction of information from technical documentation (by our previously developed system of information extraction from a natural language text). We describe the ontology classes and domains that define communicating concurrent processes. These processes are characterized by sets of local and shared variables, a list of actions on these variables which change their values, a list of channels for the process communication (which, in turn, are characterized by the type of reading messages, capacity, modes of writing and reading, and reliability), and also a list of communication actions for sending messages. In addition to the formal mathematical definition of classes and domains of the ontology, examples of descriptions of some ontological classes, as well as typical properties and axioms for them, are specified in the editor Protégé in the OWL language with the use of the inference rules in the SWRL language. We define the formal operational semantics of communicating processes for their ontological representation. This semantics is a labeled transition system. It is reduced to the local operational semantics of separate process instances in the interleaving model. We specialize several types of processes from the subject domain of automatic control systems that model the typical functional elements of the automatic control system (sensors, comparators and regulators), as well as their combinations. The concepts of the specialized ontology are illustrated by the example of a control part of a bottle-filling system.",60016779,"A.P.

Two probabilistic models have been analyzed. Calculating formulas for estimating the probability and probability density of score points gained by one or another player were obtained. Some really used tournament systems were analyzed with the stochastic modeling method. The available results also provide an order of objects presenting to experts while organizing the examination by paired comparison. An analytical estimation of probability of tournament results (or pared comparison) was obtained.

311,311,Application of a Genetic Algorithm for Finding Edit Distances between Process Models,"Abstract—: Finding graph edit distances (determining the similarity of graph models) is an important task in various areas of computer science, such as image analysis, machine learning, and chemoinformatics. In recent years, due to the development of process mining techniques, it has become necessary to adapt the existing graph matching methods to be applied to the analysis of process models (annotated graphs) discovered from event logs of information systems. In particular, methods for finding the minimum graph edit distance can be used to reveal patterns (subprocesses) and to compare discovered process models. As was shown experimentally and theoretically substantiated, exact methods for finding the minimum edit distance between the discovered process models (and graphs in the general case) have a great time complexity and can be applied only to small-sized process models. In this paper, we estimate the accuracy and time performance characteristics of a genetic algorithm applied to find distances between process models discovered from the event logs. In particular, we find distances between BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) models discovered from the event logs by using different synthesis algorithms. It is shown that the genetic algorithm proposed in the paper allows us to significantly reduce the computation time and produces results close to the optimal solutions (the minimum edit distances).",60020513,National Research University Higher School of Economics,Moscow,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",30.428571428571427,0.13645833333333335,0.5479166666666666,1

This influence on movement was measured, in a series of three experiments, both as an involuntary deviations in the trajectory in a tracking task and as the probability of taking the left/right-branch in a Y-junction of a simulated road. The effects found in previous works have shown relevant implications for road safety. None of previous theoretical models are able to account for most of present and those previous results. Three different attentional cues were used to test if the path movement of University students was influenced. Endogenous and exogenous attentional cues were used in a series of the three experiment. Data show the key role of both the meaning per se of cues and the context--in which these cues are presented--in determining the kind of effect on movement. The most relevant result is that participants approach to the location in which traffic signs were presented. In this sense, I discuss the relevance of the results from a cognitive-ergonomic point of view. Regarding its theoretical contribution, findings support recently-proposed accounts for the relationship between attention and movement (MDRA model).",60027844,Universidad de Granada,Granada,Spain,['1702'],19.1,0.16,0.44166666666666665,1

314,314,Single sensor multi-spectral imaging,"This dissertation presents the benefits of using a multispectral Single Sensor Camera (SSC) that, simultaneously acquire images in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands. The principal benefits while addressing problems related to image bands in the spectral range of 400 to 1100 nanometers, there are cost reductions in the hardware setup because only one SSC is needed instead of two; moreover, the cameras' calibration and images alignment are not required anymore. Concerning to the NIR spectrum, even though this band is close to the visible band and shares many properties, the sensor sensitivity is material dependent due to different behavior of absorption/reflectance capturing a given scene compared to visible channels. Many works in literature have proven the benefits of working with NIR to enhance RGB images (e.g., image enhancement, dehazing, etc.). In spite of the advantage of using SSC (e.g., low latency), there are some drawbacks to be solved. One of these drawbacks corresponds to the nature of the silicon-based sensor, which in addition to capturing the RGB image when the infrared cut off filter is not installed it also acquires NIR information into the visible image. This phenomenon is called RGB and NIR crosstalking. This thesis firstly faces this problem in challenging images and then it shows the benefit of using multispectral images in the edge detection task. Then, three methods based on CNN have been proposed for edge detection. While the first one is based on the most used model, holistically-nested edge detection (HED) termed as multispectral HED (MS-HED), the other two have been proposed observing the drawbacks of MS-HED. These two novel architectures have been designed from scratch; after the first architecture is validated in the visible domain a slight redesign is proposed to tackle the multispectral domain. A dataset is collected to face this problem with SSCs. Even though edge detection is confronted in the multispectral domain, its qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates the generalization in other datasets used for edge detection, improving state-of-the-art results. One of the main properties of this proposal is to show that the edge detection problem can be tackled by just training the proposed architecture one-time while validating it in other datasets.",60023020,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Barcelona,Spain,"['1712', '1707']",25.785714285714285,0.12103174603174605,0.44523809523809516,1

Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles can act as controllable and highly mobile data carriers between separated network clusters to enable delay-tolerant inter-cluster communication. A possible heterogeneous set of usable aerial vehicles and the necessity to adapt the system to various environments requires the system to be highly flexible. Combined with severe constraints in energy usage or number of available vehicles, there is a need to increase the efficiency of inter-cluster flights.

In this study, we develop an algorithm called DeCIMA (Detecting the Crotch In Mesh Analysis). DeCIMA automatically finds the crotch, as one of the fundamental landmarks on 3D human optical scans. DeCIMA presents a solution for finding the crotch-location even in challenging cases where the subjects' thighs are connected. We test DeCIMA on 225 scans obtained from 75 human subjects using three different scanners.

The attitude report 'know' in most languages so far known typically selects for a factive complement (Kiparsky and Kiparsky 1970, Hintikka 1975 a.o.). One generalization made is that nominalized complements tend to convey a factive reading, while non-nominal ones tend not to (Kastner 2015, Moulton 2015 a.o.). This work demonstrates that for a clause selected by a cognitive epistemic attitude verb to have a factive reading, it bears a nominal (D) feature with a structural case, whereas a clause for a non-factive reading, it does not, in alternation languages and possibly beyond. This work shows that a nominalized clause with the internal type 'pro-fact' noun-(u)n kes in Korean (and in Japanese as well with koto), witness-based, is factively presupposed by itself and contradicted if predicated by negated veracious adjectives in a veridicality test. It is embedded also by a doxastic verb such as mit-'believe.' The non-factive alternants of 'know' in all the languages logically belong to the doxastic category of 'believe', though with implication of evidential justification in distinction with the real 'believe,' undergoing neg-raising, revealing their anti-rogativity.

These joints are machined into a tube made of a super-elastic material to create two joints near the tip of the tool. The directional stiffness properties of the flexural joint are exploited to minimize inter-joint coupling. We perform a static analysis of each joint and a kinematic analysis of the entire robot.

People recognition is made in the corrected images by machine learning method. Recognition results are used to calculate 3D position of people in workplace. Only very few markers are set on floor of workplace to make calibration between perspective projection images and plane of workplace floor.

328,328,Characterizing Environmental Interactions for Soft Growing Robots,"Soft, tip-extending devices, or 'vine robots,' are a promising new paradigm for navigating cluttered and confined environments. Because they lengthen from their tips, there is little relative movement of the body with the environment, and the compressible nature of the device allows it to pass through orifices smaller than its diameter. However, the interaction between these devices and the environment is not well characterized. Here we present a comprehensive mathematical model that describes vine robot behavior during environmental interaction that provides a basis from which informed designs can be generated in future works. The model incorporates transverse and axial buckling modes that result from growing into obstacles with varying surface normals, as well as internal path-dependent and independent resistances to growth. Accordingly, the model is able to predict the pressure required to grow through a given environment due to the interaction forces it experiences. We experimentally validate both the individual components and the full model. Finally, we present three design insights from the model and demonstrate how they each improve performance in confined space navigation.

Probabilistic dependency relationships among the variables can be represented by Bayesian networks. One strategy of a structure learning Bayesian Networks is the score and search technique. In this paper, we present a new method for structure learning of the Bayesian network which is based on Pigeon Inspired Optimization (PIO) Algorithm. The proposed algorithm is a simple one with fast convergence rate. In nature, the navigational ability of pigeons is unbelievable and highly impressive. In accordance with the PIO search algorithm, a set of directed acyclic graphs is defined. Every graph owns a score which shows its fitness. The algorithm is iterated until it gets the best solution or a satisfactory network structure using map and compass, and landmark operator. In this work, the proposed method compared with Simulated Annealing, Bee optimization and Simulated Annealing as a hybrid algorithm, Bee optimization and Greedy search as a hybrid algorithm, and Greedy Search using BDeu score function. We also investigated the confusion matrix performances of the methods. The paper presents the results of extensive evaluations of these algorithms based on common benchmark data sets.

There are many existing no-reference image quality metrics (IQMs) that are able to assess natural image quality by taking into account similar image-based quality attributes. Previous study showed that IQMs can assess face sample quality according to the biometric system performance. In addition, re-training an IQM can improve its performance for face biometric images. However, only one database was used in the previous study, and it contains only image-based distortions. In this paper, we propose to extend the previous study by use multiple face database including FERET color face database, and apply multiple setups for the re-training process in order to investigate how the re-training process affect the performance of no-reference image quality metric for face biometric images.

335,335,IoTLogBlock: Recording Off-line Transactions of Low-Power IoT Devices Using a Blockchain,"For any distributed system, and especially for the Internet of Things, recording interactions between devices is essential. At first glance, blockchains seem to be suitable for storing these interactions, as they allow multiple parties to share a distributed ledger. However, at a closer look, blockchains require heavy computations, large memory capacity, and always-on communication to the cloud; these are three properties that are challenging for IoT devices with limited resources.In this paper, we present IoTLogBlock to address these challenges. IoTLogBlock connects resource-constrained IoT devices to the blockchain, and it consists of three building blocks jointly enabling recording transactions: a lightweight contract signing protocol, a blockchain network, and a smart contract. The contract signing protocol allows devices to interact locally to perform transactions, even if no communication to the cloud and the blockchain exists at that moment. At a later time, devices forward the stored transactions to the blockchain, where a smart contract ultimately verifies the transactions.We evaluate our design on low-power devices and quantify the performance in terms of memory, computation, and energy consumption. Our results show that a constrained device can create and sign a transaction within 3 s on average.

In this era, advanced persistent threats (APTs) can incur significant cost for organizations and businesses. The ultimate goal of cyber security is to thwart attackers from achieving their malicious intent, whether it is credential stealing, infrastructure takeover, or program sabotage. Every cyber attack goes through several stages before its termination. Lateral movement (LM) is one of those stages which is of particular importance. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a method used in LM to successfully authenticate to an unauthorized host that leaves footprints on both host and network logs. In this paper, we propose to detect evidence of LM with an anomaly detection approach that leverages Windows RDP event logs.

Therefore, NDN is a suitable candidate for content retrieval in Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), which are characterized by path breaks due to intermittent connectivity. In an NDN-VANET to avoid path breaks broadcasting every message is considered the most reliable way for content retrieval. In this work, we unicast messages to reduce the usage of network resources, when it is possible. Our work limits the dissemination area of messages by installing directional antennas in vehicles. We develop an algorithm to choose the appropriate directional antenna to unicast a message, allowing vehicles outside of the spreading area of the message to perform other tasks. Moreover, each vehicle performs route discovery to nodes that store content, when the content is not retrieved after a specific time period.

This has brought to many disjoint IoT silos. Significant efforts have been devoted to integration, recurrently resulting into bigger centralized infrastructures. Such an approach often stumbles upon the reluctance of IoT system owners to loose the dominion over data. We introduce a secured and privacy-safe infrastructure where a federation overlay is distributed among parties and the data control is kept locally. This establishes a league of peers each sovereign of their IoT system and data: League of IoT Sovereignties (LIoTS). LIoTS is scalable by design, allowing iterative formation of domains levels due to the transparency of its federation.

In the recent decades, development of new research tools and techniques allowed labeling and modulation of the specific memory storage cell engram in particular brain regions. In this review, we summarize the concept of engrams, which encode memory ensembles. Further, we introduce the recent research strategies to identify and manipulate the engram cells.

345,345,Fast restoring of high dynamic range image appearance for multi-partial reset sensor,"Improving image quality by capturing high dynamic range (HDR) in a scene remains a technological challenge for CMOS sensors. The multi partial reset is a simple technique that allows a sensor to capture HDR inexpensively with high frame rate, low noise floor, and high signal to noise ratio. However, it flattens images due to compression of highlights, rending it useful only for machine vision and automotive applications. In this work, we present an inverse function that restores HDR image appearance specifically for a multi partial reset sensor (MPRS). This function can be applied in software or firmware before demosaicing. Results show that the function automatically enliven images with more depth and saturation that suit general purpose photography. Moreover, latency results show that it can be applied for real-time videography of high frame rate.

Moreover, work that has targeted such scenarios has, so far, not considered platoon formation strategies - or only considered idealized vehicle dynamics, platooning controllers, or wireless network dynamics. We fill this gap by investigating dynamic platoon formation at urban intersections controlled by regular traffic lights. We propose a fuel-efficient strategy for platoon formation at such intersections and investigate its performance using realistic simulation models of (all of) vehicle dynamics, platooning controllers, and wireless networking.

The dynamics of the system is described by coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE) and partial differential equation (PDE). Considering actuators saturation, hyperbolic tangent functions and secant functions are adopted to tackle the input constraints.

In this manuscript, we leverage Virtual Network Function (VNF) techniques to implement a video adaptation service that automatically adapts the quality of video transmissions depending on the status of the network. Furthermore, Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) techniques are employed here to simplify, optimise and speed up the deployment process of the aforementioned video adapter service (vAdapter), and therefore, allowing its on-demand deployment in a flexible way.

These applications allow us to interact with other users and include a functionality that can help us to implement bots that automate various business processes or provide information services. This paper considers a specialized question answering system that employs today’s messaging services infrastructure to support university applicants. Over two years, we gathered a corpus of typical questions of applicants and developed an information retrieval model for finding similar questions in this corpus. Applicants can type their questions using natural language without any formal requirements to phrase construction or using special templates. If the system is unable to find a relevant answer, the user can directly address the question to representatives of the university. The system was implemented using modern cloud services provided by Amazon. We used serverless computations and NoSQL databases, so we had to develop an appropriate architecture of the service. Since the system operates sensitive personal data and provides personalized service, we analyzed methods of ensuring system security and approaches to user authorization.

364,364,An Odd Couple: Loss-Based Congestion Control and Minimum RTT Scheduling in MPTCP,"Selecting the best path in multi-path heterogeneous networks is challenging. Multi-path TCP uses by default a scheduler that selects the path with the minimum round trip time (minRTT). A well-known problem is head-of-line blocking at the receiver when packets arrive out of order on different paths. We shed light on another issue that occurs if scheduling have to deal with deep queues in the network. First, we highlight the relevance by a real-world experiment in cellular networks that often deploy deep queues. Second, we elaborate on the issues with minRTT scheduling and deep queues in a simplified network to illustrate the root causes; namely the interaction of the minRTT scheduler and loss-based congestion control that causes extensive bufferbloat at network elements and distorts RTT measurement. This results in extraordinary large buffer sizes for full utilization. Finally, we discuss mitigation techniques and show how alternative congestion control algorithms mitigate the effect.",60016294,Fachhochschule Flensburg,Flensburg,Germany,"['1705', '1708']",18.75,0.2092261904761905,0.5528273809523809,1

This work proposes methods to automate the char reactivity characterisation using microscopy images and computer vision techniques. These methods are summarised in three contributions: the localisation of char particles based on candidate regions and deep learning methods; the classification of particles into char reactivity groups using morphological and texture features; and the integration in a system of the two previous proposals to characterise char sample reactivity.

366,366,Deep head pose estimation using synthetic images and partial adversarial domain adaption for continuous label spaces,"Head pose estimation aims at predicting an accurate pose from an image. Current approaches rely on supervised deep learning, which typically requires large amounts of labeled data. Manual or sensor-based annotations of head poses are prone to errors. A solution is to generate synthetic training data by rendering 3D face models. However, the differences (domain gap) between rendered (source-domain) and real-world (target-domain) images can cause low performance. Advances in visual domain adaptation allow reducing the influence of domain differences using adversarial neural networks, which match the feature spaces between domains by enforcing domain-invariant features. While previous work on visual domain adaptation generally assumes discrete and shared label spaces, these assumptions are both invalid for pose estimation tasks. We are the first to present domain adaptation for head pose estimation with a focus on partially shared and continuous label spaces. More precisely, we adapt the predominant weighting approaches to continuous label spaces by applying a weighted resampling of the source domain during training. To evaluate our approach, we revise and extend existing datasets resulting in a new benchmark for visual domain adaption. Our experiments show that our method improves the accuracy of head pose estimation for real-world images despite using only labels from synthetic images.",106212153,Leibniz University,Hannover,Germany,"['1712', '1707']",18.545454545454547,0.08429533429533431,0.3731361231361231,1

Based on this propagation model and a novel positioning approach, the performance of different trajectories is reevaluatedOur results show that in practice, the variance of the measurements is higher, than commonly expected in related work on MAV-assisted localization. As a result, the study of our developed trajectories show localization errors of 6-7m in a 400x400m2 area.

370,370,Improvement of page ranking algorithm by negative score of spam pages,"There are billions of web pages in the web and the most significant point is how to search these pages regarding their usefulness. Usually a user enters a query into a search engine and looking for the best responses. Search engines work based on ranking algorithms. Ranking algorithms employ web mining methods. Web mining is divided into structure, content and web usage mining. In search engines, related pages with user's query must be listed as a result and to obtain a better results, content mining algorithms may be included. Features such as input and output weight, content weight, spam score, length of URL, the number of related pages and href tags values are considered with a negative score. Proposed algorithms are implemented and compared with well-known algorithm. In this algorithm, Spam score feature is used which is combined with the age of domain and content weight of pages. In PRS (PageRank with Spam score) and PRST (PageRank with Spam score and Time factor) algorithms a better response is achieved than PR (PageRank) algorithm. Obtained results of the other algorithm, WPCRST (Weighted Page Content Rank with Spam score and Time factor) indicates that all measures are improved comparing with PR algorithm and provide better responses. First proposed algorithm combines extracted spam features from ""moz. com"" with structural features of Web mining. In the second proposed algorithm age of pages is used in addition to the neighborhood matrix and spam score. This feature is used to fix the rich getting richer. Logically this algorithm offers better scores than the previous algorithms. Third proposed algorithm uses weighting methods. In fact, in this algorithm, weight of inbound links and weight of outbound links and content weight of pages are used simultaneously. This algorithm includes web content mining by using content weight of pages. Values of TFIDF and BM25 algorithms are used to obtain the content weight. Obtained results specify that this algorithm has a better ranking than PRST algorithm except for the measure of precision. About 41 percent improvement can be seen in the measure of NDCG and 48 percent improvement for precision while AP has improved 0.8 percent and finally 2.5 percent improvement can be seen in Mean NDCG.

Here, we propose a visualization method of customer evaluation based on customer satisfaction data linked to fragmented customer experiences, using a web-based questionnaire system that allows customers to describe the process of the customer experience by themselves. To evaluate the practical application, we constructed a prototypical environment that allows visual interaction using a business process modeling environment as an interface. In order to develop this system, we conducted a survey of customer experience regarding customer behavior by web questionnaire for service users. In this system, the linkage between the overall customer satisfaction and the partial satisfaction connected to each customer behavior are displayed visibly by applying a business process modeling tool.

372,372,Association and Reliability in 802.11ad Networks: An Experimental Study,"With the exponential increase in wireless data traffic risking to overwhelm the current networking infrastructures, mmWave networking is seen as on of the most promising paths out of the logjam. IEEE introduced a new standard recently, 802.11ad, that uses mmWave frequencies for delivering multi-Gigabit capacities in a WLAN setting. Such capacities, however, do not come for free: mmWave frequencies have poor propagation characteristics and suffer from blockage, whose consequences on the networking protocols are not fully understood.In this paper, we aim at in-depth understanding of two key primitives in 802.11ad networks in environments rich with blockage: user association and reliability. Using careful measurements on COTS hardware, we find that user association under blockage takes an unreasonably long time, and, after analyzing the causes, provide practical insights on how to reduce this time by an order of magnitude. Relying on a multi-layer tracing tool allowing unprecedented granularity in the analysis of 802.11ad networks, we find that the part of the new standard regarding reliability is underspecified leading to different interpretations in practice. Their potential impact on performance is then evaluated using trace-based simulations, which reveal an interesting throughput-reliability tradeoff. Finally, we find that TCP is poorly prepared for sudden changes in round-trip timeouts, as those induced by link blockage in mmWave networks, leading to an unnecessary increase in timeouts.",60102124,Université Fédérale Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées,Toulouse,France,"['1705', '1708']",31.142857142857142,0.06511857707509881,0.591699604743083,1

These devices are intended for use in the area of medicine, pharmacology and human physiology. Currently existing bioimplants need to be periodically removed from a body to replace a source of energy supply and then reinstall them in a body. It is to a certain degree a threat to the health of the patient and degrades the quality of his life. Developed by the authors wireless charger for transcutaneous energy supply of implantable modules automatically adjusts the power of the electromagnetic field.

The methodology for assessing the impact of the energy fields of experimental prototype of implant power supplies' wireless charging on biological objects is presented. This solution minimizes the heating of the receiving module, both in the area of the receiving circuit, and in the area of the stabilizer of the charging current of the battery.

374,374,A Method for Guiding a Person Combining Robot Movement and Projection,"This paper proposes a new method to guide a person along with a route when a mobile robot explains an exhibition. In previous work, there were problems that people overtake the robot and go out of the guide route, and that people move to positions that interferes with the movement of the robot. In response to these problems, a conventional solution is to frequently instruct people to move by using voice, displays, etc., and it was not a comfortable for people who are guided. In this paper, we focus on a mobile robot with a projection function and propose a method of controlling human positions without explicit instructions by combining movement and projection of a robot. We introduce three basic guiding behaviors combining projection and movement, each controlling a person and a robot into different positional relationship according to the situation of guiding. Experiments of basic guiding behaviors showed that both the existence of the robot and the position of the projected image are combined to affect the movement of the guided person. The result indicates that by selecting appropriate guide behavior according to the situation of guiding, the robot can guide a person effectively while controlling the position of the person.",60032345,Hiroshima City University,Hiroshima,Japan,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",28.857142857142858,0.0751672569854388,0.39348681621408893,1
375,375,Estimating the Average Temporal Benefit in Probabilistic Environmental–Economic Models,"Abstract: This paper considers environmental–economic models of optimal harvesting, given by impulsive differential equations, which depend on random parameters. We assume that lengths of intervals θk between the moments of impulses τk are random variables and the sizes of impulse influence depend on random parameters vk, k = 1, 2,… One example of such objects is an impulsive equation that simulates dynamics of the population subject to harvesting. In the absence of harvesting, the population development is described by the differential equation x = g(x), and in time points τk some random share of resource vk, k = 1, 2,… is taken from the population. We can control the gathering process so that to stop harvesting when its share will appear big enough to save the biggest possible remaining resource to increase the size of the next gathering. Let the equation x=g(x) have an asymptotic stable solution ϕ(t) ≡ K whose attraction region is the interval (K1,K2) where 0 ≤ K1 < K < K2 We construct the control u = (u1,…, uk,…), which limits a share of the harvested resource at each moment of time τk so that the quantity of the remaining resource, since some moment τk0 would be not less than the given value x ϵ (K1,K). For any x ϵ (K1,K) the estimates of the average temporal benefit, valid with the probability of one, are obtained. It is shown that there is a unique x* ϵ (K1,K), at which the lower estimate reaches the greatest value. Thus, we described the way of population control at which the value of the average time profit can be lower estimated with the probability of one by the greatest number whenever possible.",60020886,Vladimir State University,Vladimir,Russian Federation,"['1712', '1711']",35.25,-0.04057017543859648,0.5421052631578948,1

378,378,An improved spectral clustering algorithm for large-scale wind farm power prediction," All rights reserved.Aiming at reaching the balance between calculation efficiency and power prediction accuracy of wind farms, two improved spectral clustering (SC) algorithms and their application framework are proposed. For classical k-way Ng-Jordan-Weiss SC, the clustering sample space is composed of k eigenvectors, which may lose part of structural information and may not reach accurate clustering results. To improve the accuracy and stability, we proposed to cluster with feature expansion and the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. We extended the clustering eigenspace from k eigenvectors to 2k to improve the clustering accuracy. To avoid following into local optimum while extending the eigenspace, the CS algorithm was introduced to search for better initial points instead of the random choice method. To apply the proposed algorithm for wind power prediction, wind turbines with similar wind regime were designated to the same group using the proposed SC algorithm. The power prediction model was established for each wind turbine group, and the output power of the entire wind farm was obtained by superposition. Experimental results indicated that the clustering accuracy is improved and the results of multiple clustering hold steady, which meets the requirement of accurate and timely prediction of wind farm power.",60008919,Guilin University of Electronic Technology,Guilin,China,"['1712', '1702']",24.875,0.1177777777777778,0.3544444444444445,0

We present a flexible custom setup that can simulate these geometries, which we evaluate both qualitatively and quantitatively over a set of samples with varied optical properties. We also compare our measurements against those of widely used commercial solutions, and show that significant differences exist over our test set.

The general aim of scene text understanding is to localize and recognize text in scene images. Text regions are first localized in the original image by a trained detector model and afterwards fed into a recognition module. The tasks of localization and recognition are highly correlated since an inaccurate localization can affect the recognition task. The main purpose of this thesis is to devise efficient methods for scene text understanding. We investigate how the latest results on deep learning can advance text understanding pipelines. Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and derived methods have achieved a significant performance on semantic segmentation and pixel level classification tasks. Therefore, we took benefit of the strengths of FCN approaches in order to detect and recognize text in natural scenes images.",60023020,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Barcelona,Spain,"['1712', '1707']",20.0,0.2608333333333333,0.5701190476190476,1
387,387,Dynamic Vehicle Path-Planning in the Presence of Traffic Events,"Advanced Driver Assistance Systems require a tremendous amount of sensor information to support the driver's comfort and safety. In particular, systems that provide (good) route options to a vehicle rely on information, such as traffic jams and road blockages, which is sensed by other (possibly distant) vehicles and distributed by a central server. This information is clearly dynamic and may be invalid by the time the vehicle arrives at the affected location. In this work, we develop an innovative approach to determine optimal routes (minimizing the costs like travel-time to their destination) for vehicles whose original route is adversely impacted by a (severe) road event. A set of recursive equations is developed that yields the optimal decision for each vehicle at each decision-point. Simulations show that our approach adapts to the considered event and finds routes of similar quality as a full-knowledge approach with limited communication overhead.",60108460,IMDEA Networks Institute,Madrid,Spain,"['1705', '1708']",24.5,0.1627551020408163,0.4834183673469388,1

Model performance is evaluated through saliency metrics as well as the influence of model inspiration and consistency with human psychophysics. SID4VAM is composed of 230 synthetic images, with known salient regions. Images were generated with 15 distinct types of low-level features (e.g. orientation, brightness, color, size...) with a target-distractor pop-out type of synthetic patterns. We have used Free-Viewing and Visual Search task instructions and 7 feature contrasts for each feature category. Our study reveals that state-of-the-art Deep Learning saliency models do not perform well with synthetic pattern images, instead, models with Spectral/Fourier inspiration outperform others in saliency metrics and are more consistent with human psychophysical experimentation. This study proposes a new way to evaluate saliency models in the forthcoming literature, accounting for synthetic images with uniquely low-level feature contexts, distinct from previous eye tracking image datasets.",60028419,Universidad de Santiago de Compostela,Santiago de Compostela,Spain,"['1712', '1707']",18.625,0.1540633608815427,0.3246556473829201,1

To achieve the goal, DENA adjusts the transmission rate for each flow with deadlines and reduce the flow completion time (FCT) when the paths of flows are pre-given. Moreover, DENA includes a neural network classifier and a DRL system (DS). Accordingly, classifier separates the mice and elephant flows, then directly transfers the mice flows to avoid latency, while DS detects the interval of the most significant energy consumption density as a critical interval to schedule elephant flows. Besides, we apply deep deterministic policy gradient to DS with the advantage of an optimal base solution to enhance the accuracy of exploration. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use DRL for the rate adjustment. Our results show that besides saving energy, DENA reduces FCT for elephant flows workload 4.12%, data mining 1.04% and Hadoop 3.8%.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1705', '1708']",22.0,0.1325,0.5108333333333333,1

DR is a primary cause of blindness in working-age people and it is estimated that 3 to 4 million people with diabetes are blinded by DR every year worldwide. Early diagnosis have been considered an effective way to mitigate such problem. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to analyze the DR images generated by the fundus camera for automatically DR diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on identifying small lesions on DR fundus images. The results from our analysis, which include the lesion category and their exact locations in the image, can be used to facilitate the determination of DR severity (indicated by DR stages). Different from traditional object detection for natural images, lesion detection for fundus images have unique challenges. Specifically, the size of a lesion instance is usually very small, compared with the original resolution of the fundus images, making them diffcult to be detected. We analyze the lesion-vs-image scale carefully and propose a large-size feature pyramid network (LFPN) to preserve more image details for mini lesion instance detection. Our method includes an effective region proposal strategy to increase the sensitivity. The experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to the original feature pyramid network (FPN) method and Faster RCNN.",60033461,University of Massachusetts Lowell,Lowell,United States,"['1712', '1702', '1706']",20.09090909090909,0.20000000000000004,0.6378947368421053,1
392,392,Hybrid G-PRNU: Optimal parameter selection for scale-invariant asymmetric source smartphone identification,"The ease in counterfeiting both origin and content of a video necessitates the search for a reliable method to identify the source of a media file - a crucial part of forensic investigation. One of the most accepted solutions to identify the source of a digital image involves comparison of its photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) fingerprint. However, for videos, prevalent methods are not as efficient as image source identification techniques. This is due to the fact that the fingerprint is affected by the postprocessing steps done to generate the video. In this paper, we answer affirmatively to the question of whether one can use images to generate the reference fingerprint pattern to identify a video source. We introduce an approach called ""Hybrid G-PRNU"" that provides a scale-invariant solution for video source identification by matching its fingerprint with the one extracted from images. Another goal of our work is to find the optimal parameters to reach an optimal identification rate. Experiments performed demonstrate higher identification rate, while doing asymmetric comparison of video PRNU with the reference pattern generated from images, over several test cases.

However, it has been increasing challenging to ensure the accurate detection of heavy flows while dealing with massive network traffic volume, diversified traffic distribution and the stringent memory requirement. Although recent research efforts like LD-Sketch are scalable for diverse network traffic, they depend on excessive memory to maintain high accuracy, such that they fail to work well when the memory is limited. We propose RL-Sketch, a adaptive sketch using reinforcement learning in detecting heavy flows. It predicts potential heavy flows based on the statistics of network traffic, to achieve both high accuracy and scalability with minor memory. Trace-driven evaluation shows that RL-Sketch achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art sketch-based technologies with up to 17.79× accuracy gain, while maintaining high robustness in extreme conditions.",60017605,Fuzhou University,Fuzhou,China,"['1705', '1708']",21.285714285714285,-0.00276785714285714,0.5810912698412697,1

In most of the systems, leveraging elements of crowd computing, workflow or algorithm (how to split the original problem into parts, how to distribute them between human participants and how to merge the results received from different human participants) is defined as a part of system design. While it pays back in a wide range of tasks (usually simple ones), it is widely recognized that rigid workflows turn out to be very limiting when applied to complex problems (e.g., decision support). The paper proposes an approach to create flexible and adaptive decision support systems on the basis of an environment, supporting human-machine collective intelligence. The distinctive features of the proposed environment are: a) fusion of elements of collective intelligence and artificial intelligence, b) support for natural self-organization processes in the community of participants (supported by self-organization protocols, convenient for different kinds of participants of a heterogeneous human-machine system), c) interoperability of participants (both human and machine), achieved via multi-aspect ontologies, d) soft guidance in the process of self-organization.",60101977,St. Petersburg Institute for Informatics and Automation of the Russian Academy of Sciences,Saint Petersburg (ex Leningrad),Russian Federation,['1700'],37.8,0.03625,0.4253571428571429,1
396,396,Bifröst: a Modular Blockchain Interoperability API,"The blockchain (BC) world is rapidly becoming a universe of several ledgers designed for a specific purpose, holding data previously stored (i.e., siloed) in centralized databases. The use of different BCs for the same purpose could hamper the frictionless exchange of data or value. On one hand, it is natural that there are competing implementations exploring the benefits of BC. On the other hand, the problem of siloed data re-emerges, with respect to isolated chains. In this regard, BC interoperability is necessary to connect different BCs, exchanging information and assets. Moreover, to foster BC employment, developers must be able to interact with such different BCs without knowing the details of each implementation. This paper presents a novel solution, called Bifröst, to store and retrieve data on different BCs. Bifröst employs a notary scheme, which allows for connectivity to different BCs.

401,401,Closed-loop Force Control of a Pneumatic Gripper Actuated by Two Pressure Regulators,"Robotic arms can perform grasping actions thanks to their 'dexteorus' part, i.e. the gripper. Among the various categories, nowadays pneumatic grippers became the most employed in industry, as they have low cost and little bulkiness. Despite their simplicity, controlling the force applied by these grippers is not straightforward due to the dependence of such a force on the air pressure in the gripper chambers. As a result, it is still tricky to implement closed-loop force control for pneumatic grippers. This paper intends to deliver a control scheme relying on the force measurement to control pneumatic grippers. The force might be measured through a commercial sensor (e.g. a load cell) and fed back to close the control loop. This includes a calibration which maps the force-pressure relation taking into account both desired force and length of the gripper fingers. The control scheme exploits two different pressure regulators to precisely adjust the air pressure inside the gripper chambers (i.e. opening and closing chambers). To this aim, a quadratic programming algorithm is employed. The control scheme performance revealed to be good: results will be shown in terms of gripper response to sinusoidal and step inputs, along with the pressure-force characterization.",60107402,Ospedale Policlinico San Martino,Genova,Italy,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",15.153846153846153,0.08571428571428572,0.38928571428571423,1

We study the print patterns of 8 inkjet printers from different manufacturers. We look at the features of the data by reducing its dimensions using Principle Component Analysis. This shows significant separation between printers which implies that the Deep Neural Network was able to pick up on key differences. The results are also comparable with that of reducing dimensions with Linear Discriminant Analysis. The model however does have some limitations regarding ink density and print media. It always classifies an image amongst the trained printers and does not show anomalies. For this, we consider the Gaussian distribution of target printers to see how the probabilities fared when trained and fitted separately for each printer, thus having a set of images that do not fit in with any of the printers for which the classifier was trained.

The user collects thematically relevant information iteratively in a 'query-browse-refine' process being motivated by learning, understanding, and knowledge acquisition purposes. We consider an elementary step of this scenario in which the search intent can be expressed by a long text query. For this case, we develop an exploratory search engine based on probabilistic topic modeling. Topic model gives a low-dimensional sparse interpretable vector representation (topical embedding) of a text. The search engine uses these embeddings for ranking documents by their similarity to the query. We show that performing only one query, the topic-based search engine achieves better precision and recall that human assessors do spending up to one hour in a conventional browse-refine loop. We use additive regularization for topic modeling (ARTM) to make the model simultaneously sparse, decorrelated, n-gram, multimodal and hierarchical. We show experimentally that each of these features of the model is important to achieve precision and recall higher than 90%. Topical hierarchy emulates a natural human strategy to focus on subtopics gradually discarding unnecessary information. Also we show that increasing the number of levels in the hierarchy improves the search quality and makes it possible to enrich the model with a larger number of topics.

410,410,CAD-based viewpoint estimation of texture-less object for purposive perception using domain adaptation," All rights reserved.In vision-based robot manipulation tasks, precise pose estimation is an important problem. In practical application, however, it is difficult to directly acquire the precise 6-DOF (degree of freedom) pose relation between camera and object in real environment. For a vision-based robot system, it is often necessary to transfer the camera to certain viewpoints for better observation or manipulation. Therefore, the viewpoint estimation can be regarded as a fundamental process for precise pose estimation. In this paper, the viewpoint estimation is considered a two-axis orientation measurement and converted to viewpoint classification problem. We define an object-centred viewpoint sphere and propose an efficient pipeline utilizing computer-aided design (CAD) environment and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to acquire a two-dimensional viewpoint of the object relative to the camera. We first utilize CAD models and render techniques to automatically build a large-scale synthetic dataset for training. As these rendered images are taken in ideal conditions, the data distribution of synthetic images is different from that captured in real environment. To bridge the gap, we propose a two-stream network with the aid of an unsupervised domain adaptation method to train a classifier that can be applied in real environment. The experiment results evaluated on annotated real images demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can successfully address the problem of viewpoint estimation for texture-less objects in real environment and produce promising results.",60025084,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai,China,"['1712', '1702']",22.7,0.2340136054421769,0.5645124716553289,0

The 5G technology is expected to have such multi-tier architecture with various computational capability and radio enabled IoT devices. However, the coexistence of such heterogeneous network model spawns research challenges such as interference management, non-uniform computational capacity with non-uniform devices connectivity and service deadline. Thus, in this paper, we propose a coexistence of D2D-IoT (D-IoT) and fog computing model in cellular networks and formulate the resource allocation problem in such a multi-tier architecture considering different kinds of interference, data rate, and latency altogether as an optimization problem and further propose a distributed many-to-many stable matching based solution. Through extensive theoretical and simulation analysis, we have shown the effect of different parameters on the resource allocation objectives and achieve more than 94% of optimum network performance.",60104039,"International Institute of Information Technology, Bhubaneswar",Bhubaneswar,India,"['1705', '1708']",29.5,0.08269841269841269,0.49137566137566124,1
413,413,Depth-map estimation using combination of global deep network and local deep random forest," Unlike previous related works estimating global depth-map using deep neural networks, this study uses the global and local feature of image together to reflect local changes in the depth map instead of using only global feature. A coarse-scale network is designed to predict the global-coarse depth map structure using a global view of the scene and the finer-scale random forest (RF) is to be designed to refine the depth map based on combination of original image and coarse depth map. As the first step, we use a partial structure of the multi-scale deep network (MSDN) to predict the depth of the scene at a global level. As the second step, we propose local patch-based deep RF to estimate the local depth and smoothen noise of local depth map by combining MSDN global-coarse network. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to various single images and yielded a more accurate depth-map estimation performance than other existing methods.",60015576,Keimyung University,Dalseo-gu,South Korea,"['1704', '1706', '1709', '1712']",31.2,0.04685374149659865,0.2972363945578232,0

This allows to simultaneously run applications with different requirements on link characteristics and to increase resilience against interference. To this end, we first enable sub-GHz communication in TSCH, which has been primarily defined for the 2.4 GHz band. Thereafter, we propose two designs to support multiple physical layers in TSCH on the same nodes. Our experimental evaluation shows that TSCH is applicable in a wide range of data rates between 1.2 kbps and 1000 kbps. We find that data rates of 50 kbps and below have a long communication range and a nearly perfect link symmetry, but also have a 20x higher channel utilization compared to higher data rates, increasing the risk of collisions. Using these findings, we show the advantages of the multi-band support on the example of synchronization accuracy when exchanging TSCH beacons with a low data rate and application data at a high data rate.",60107281,RISE Research Institutes of Sweden AB,Gothenburg,Sweden,"['1705', '1708']",24.142857142857142,0.1367857142857143,0.3722172619047619,1
416,416,On the Density and Diversity of Degradation Symptoms in Refactored Classes: A Multi-case Study,"Root canal refactoring is a software development activity that is intended to improve dependability-related attributes such as modifiability and reusability. Despite being an activity that contributes to these attributes, deciding when applying root canal refactoring is far from trivial. In fact, finding which elements should be refactored is not a cut-and-dried task. One of the main reasons is the lack of consensus on which characteristics indicate the presence of structural degradation. Thus, we evaluated whether the density and diversity of multiple automatically detected symptoms can be used as consistent indicators of the need for root canal refactoring. To achieve our goal, we conducted a multi-case exploratory study involving 6 open source systems and 2 systems from our industry partners. For each system, we identified the classes that were changed through one or more root canal refactorings. After that, we compared refactored and non-refactored classes with respect to the density and diversity of degradation symptoms. We also investigated if the most recurrent combinations of symptoms in refactored classes can be used as strong indicators of structural degradation. Our results show that refactored classes usually present higher density and diversity of symptoms than non-refactored classes. However, root canal refactorings that are performed by developers in practice may not be enough for reducing degradation, since the vast majority had little to no impact on the density and diversity of symptoms. Finally, we observed that symptom combinations in refactored classes are similar to the combinations in non-refactored classes. Based on our findings, we elicited an initial set of requirements for automatically recommending root canal refactorings.",60032361,Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro,Rio de Janeiro,Brazil,['1712'],20.076923076923077,0.11838235294117648,0.48333333333333334,1

A move from device-specific space to a device independent space such as XYZ space allows results to be compared, and means that the link between XYZ values and the physical parameter of interest needs only be determined once. We compare mapping approaches based on calibration data provided in image metadata, including the widely used opensource software dcraw, to a separate calibration carried out using a colorcard. The current version of dcraw is found to behave suboptimally with smartphones and should be used with care for mapping to XYZ. Other metadata approaches perform better, however the colorcard approach provides the best results.

425,425,SR Domain Partitioning in Segment Routed SDNs,"Segment Routing (SR) is a source routing paradigm that can significantly reduce the state that must be maintained in individual nodes in order to forward packets. SR involves defining segments in the network, computing the end-to-end route of a flow or packet as a sequence of segments and encoding the route in the packet header as a label stack, where each label is a Segment ID (SID) that identifies a segment. A network where a set of SIDs is used is known as an SR domain. SR is particularly suitable for Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) since the controller can compute the segment routes and configure them at the source of each flow within an SR domain. One type of SID is a Node SID where the Node ID of the tail node of a segment is used to identify the path to that node. When using Node SID, the number of SIDs that any given node must be aware of is |V |, the number of nodes in an SR Domain. However, for large networks, this might be more than the capacity of the forwarding table in a given node. In this paper, a method to partition the domain into subdomains is discussed and the reduction in the requirement for forwarding entries is studied. Experimentation with a test topology shows that a logarithmic reduction in the table size is possible by repeatedly applying this method.",60025757,Indian Institute of Technology Madras,Chennai,India,"['1705', '1708']",26.0,0.2698979591836735,0.6005102040816326,1

It is important that the optical systems of industrial cameras have small outer diameters, close minimum object distances and high resolution. In an optical system with a long focal length, the movement of the moving group increases during focusing, and this movement makes it difficult to reduce the minimum object distance.

434,434,Hair tone estimation at roots via imaging device with embedded deep learning,"Establishing accurate hair diagnosis at roots is a significant challenge with strong impact on hair coloration, beauty personalization and clinical evaluation. The roots of hair - viz. the first centimeter away from the scalp - represent clean hair fibers that have not been subjected to color change due to hair dyeing or environmental conditions. Therefore, they are a measure of a person's baseline hair characteristics, including natural hair tone. A device that acquires high resolution macro images of hair roots under a well-defined illumination geometry has been designed in order to assess natural hair tones. Image analysis in this scenario is not a trivial task since the acquired images present an overlap of scalp and hair, with other possible artifacts due to dandruff and hair transparency. In this paper, we propose to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a data-set composed of images from subjects who had their hair tone evaluated by trained color experts. Our method is compared with other popular CNNs as well as conventional color image processing approaches developed for this task. We found that the proposed model not only offers higher precision but also provides faster computation times, due to its lighter architecture in contrast to popular CNNs.

It requires several scans acquired at different distances of the object along the optical axis. This and other 3D reconstruction methods based on a scanning process are not suitable for fast inline inspection if the scanning direction does not match the object's transport direction. In this paper we propose a modification to standard microscope optics, which allows for Structure-from-Motion in microscopic domain, by including an additional aperture. The choice of aperture opening and location is crucial to reach the desired lateral and depth resolution.

Firstly, a dynamics model of the flexible manipulator was proposed through finite matrix analysis, based on the Lagrange’s dynamics equations under different control conditions. Based on the flexible dynamics model, two adaptive control systems were designed based on whether the interaction force is known. In the control stage, a separated controller was developed by applying the adaptive model and sliding mode principle. The stability and robustness of our control strategy were proved through Lyapunov’s method.

In contrast to the widely used spatial regularisation or feature selection methods, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that channel selection has been advocated for DCF-based tracking. We demonstrate that our GFS-DCF method is able to significantly improve the performance of a DCF tracker equipped with deep neural network features. In addition, our GFS-DCF enables joint feature selection and filter learning, achieving enhanced discrimination and interpretability of the learned filters. To further improve the performance, we adaptively integrate historical information by constraining filters to be smooth across temporal frames, using an efficient low-rank approximation. By design, specific temporal-spatial-channel configurations are dynamically learned in the tracking process, highlighting the relevant features, and alleviating the performance degrading impact of less discriminative representations and reducing information redundancy. The experimental results obtained on OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2017, VOT2018 and TrackingNet demonstrate the merits of our GFS-DCF and its superiority over the state-of-the-art trackers.

441,441,Theoretical modeling and performance assessment of the effects of the dissipation factor (Loss tangent) on microstrip patch antennas using rogers’ kappa-438 substrate,"r.l.-All rights reserved.– In this paper, a theoretical modeling of the microstrip patch antenna parameters is presented. The modeling considers some of the main goals of antenna design such as antenna impedance, losses, gain, radiation efficiency, and return loss. The modeling follows the progression of relating the aforementioned goals to the dissipation factor of the substrate material. The progression in modeling lays out the equations, methodically, to show how the dissipation factor affects the design goals. The modeling is backed by simulations and measurements results. The novelty lies in picking the new Rogers Kappa-438 substrate (which is identical to the FR4), to greatly improve the microstrip patch antenna performance. The results obtained and displayed, are for the input impedance, gain, return loss and the radiation pattern. A comparison in performance between the new Rogers Kappa-438 substrate results and the FR4 substrate results is made. The comparison is based on both simulations results and measurements results. In order to make the comparison, two circular microstrip patch antennas were designed and fabricated at the 1.8GHz cellular band; one is based on the FR4 substrate; the other is based on the Kappa-438 substrate. Comparisons between the Kappa-438 performance with results published in the literature based on the overall size, return loss, and gain are also made. The measured gain and radiation pattern were taken for a single frequency, while the input impedance and return loss were measured across the frequency band dictated by the limits of the measurement device.",60058937,Al-Ahliyya Amman University,Amman,Jordan,"['1711', '1708', '1705']",20.5,0.09481503345139708,0.35742817788272335,1
442,442,An extension decision tree algorithm for lightweight design of autobody structure," All rights reserved.The lightweight design of autobody involves multiple objectives and requires the collaboration between various disciplines. To improve the existing autobody lightweight designs, it is necessary to establish an accurate and objective evaluation method for lightweight effect. This paper proposes an extension decision tree (EDT) algorithm for lightweight design of autobody. The algorithm solves the contradictions in the autobody lightweight design were solved through divergence and convergence. The workflow of the solving process is shaped like a scalable diamond. Specifically, the knowledge of autobody structure was described accurately by extension modeling and extension divergence reasoning. Then, the lightweight design of autobody structure and material was achieved through extension transforms. Next, the EDT algorithm was constructed based on extension theory and the DT algorithm, and used to evaluate the lightweight effect of autobody. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as verified through a case study and a computer-aided engineering (CAE) simulation. The results show that our algorithm can accurately predict the weight reduction effect of autobody based on the case data, and generate a set of intelligent strategies to optimize the current design.

443,443,Design of visual communication based on deep learning approaches,"Aiming at the problem of object recognition caused by small object scale, multi-interaction (occlusion), and strong hiding characteristics in the scene analysis task, an object-region-enhanced network based on deep learning was proposed. The network integrated two core modules designed for the task: object area enhancement strategy and black-hole-filling strategy. The former directly corresponded the object region with high semantic confidence to the local region of the specific category channel of the convolutional feature image. Weighted features were used to improve contextual relationships, and difficult object regions were identified. The latter avoided the mistake of identifying some difficult areas as additional background classes by masking additional background classes. The results showed that the modular design scheme improved the overall parsing performance of the model by replacing the modules, and the two strategies were applied to other existing scenario parsing networks. A unified framework is proposed for handling scene resolution tasks. Benefiting from the modular design approach, the proposed algorithm improves overall performance by replacing convolution or detection modules. Object enhancement and black hole filling are applied to other systems to improve the system’s ability to parse objects. Object area enhancement methods are used to recall objects that are not recognized in a standard split network. Black hole fill techniques can be used to resolve pixels that are incorrectly categorized into additional background classes that do not exist. Therefore, a variety of contextual semantic fusion strategies have certain reference value in the theoretical level of computer vision. More critically, this method has certain reference significance for the design and development of robust and practical application systems.",108090794,Hansei University,Seoul,South Korea,['1712'],20.307692307692307,-0.009192546583850927,0.38077639751552794,1

The system exhibits a dynamical modification of the bistable attractor, giving rise to an intermit behavior, which depends of modulation strength. The resulting attractor converge to an intermittent double-scroll, for low amplitude modulation, and a 9-scroll attractor for a higher applied noise amplitude. A Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) applied to the x state variable, shows a perturbations robustness region, since the increase of noise does not present changes. Due to the applied noise, the final obtained system has higher randomness, compared with the original one.

445,445,Influencing Factors of Channel Collaboration in Multi-channel Supply Chain: A contextual ambidexterity-based analysis from the perspective of traditional retailer," All rights reserved.In multi-channel supply chain (SC), the traditional retailer can get service returns through collaboration with the direct sales channel of the manufacturer. It is very meaningful to identify the influencing factors of the channel collaboration and disclose their impacts. This paper firstly considers the cross-channel behavior of consumers, which stimulates the traditional retailer to improve its service level, and in turn exerts a spillover effect on the demand for the direct sales channel. Hence, a Stackelberg game model was set up between the manufacturer and the retailer to explore the spillover effect on pricing and service decisions. The results show that the spillover effect promotes the retailer’s service level, lowers the manufacturer’s wholesale price, and increases the profits of both sides. Next, an empirical model was built based on contextual ambidexterity, which covers multiple variables and mediators. The model was applied to examine the correlations of channel collaboration and collaboration performance with cross-channel behavior and other key factors. The empirical analysis was based on the data collected from 221 traditional retailers in multi-channel SCs across China. Through the analysis, it is confirmed that the collaboration performance is greatly promoted by the cross-channel behavior (on the level of environmental adaptation), as well as channel complementation and trust (on the level of task alignment), and the promoting effects are mediated by the three dimensions of channel collaboration, namely, special investment, information sharing and joint action. The research findings provide new insights into the channel collaboration between the traditional retailer and the manufacturer in multi-channel SC, and offer new empirical evidence to studies on contextual ambidexterity and channel behavior.",60023380,Chongqing University,Chongqing,China,['1706'],26.9,0.12749409681227863,0.46312967335694605,0

Alternate 2×6 geometry of 12 coaxial cavity horn antennas have been proven to yield a higher half-power beamwidth and low peak sidelobe ratio resulting in a better quality of the image captured. This 2×6 planar array, when fed with power according to the Dolph Chebyshev weighting polynomial, removes side lobes entirely and results in an increase half-power beamwidth (HPBW) value. A failure of any single element in the 2×6 array could lead to the alteration of the radiation pattern thereby jeopardizing the monitoring activity. This paper explores the usage of metaheuristic algorithms in order to recover the weight of the principal antenna element of the 2×6 coaxial cavity horn antenna array. The algorithms explored are Gradient Descent, Simulated Annealing, Firefly algorithm, Bat algorithm, Flower Pollination algorithm, Cuckoo search algorithm, and Harmony Search algorithm.

Electric Vehicle chargers are considered as irregular loads, which can affect the performance of distribution systems. Power utilities are facing challenges of possible overburdens, stresses, deviations in voltages and power losses from EV charging stations. The distribution network faces the possibilities of power outages and frequent voltage variations, which might be the result of unmanaged EV charging.

451,451,Understanding consumer intention to pay by contactless credit cards in Taiwan," Published by Inderscience Publishers Ltd.Contactless payment is a revolutionary innovation in transaction payments. Little is known, however, about what shapes consumers’ willingness to use this method. This study investigates the antecedents of consumer intention to pay using contactless credit cards, along with relationships among these antecedents. Based on the technology acceptance model and innovation diffusion theory, eight variables (usefulness, ease of use, perceived behavioural control, compatibility, perceived risk, trust, personal innovativeness, and consumer involvement) are proposed to analyse consumer decisions to pay using contactless credit cards. The model was evaluated using survey data from 246 consumers in Taiwan. The results indicate that compatibility and perceived risk are key determinants of consumers’ use intention to pay by contactless credit cards. However, consumers do not appear to consider the main constructs of TAM in their use intention.

452,452,Align2Ground: Weakly supervised phrase grounding guided by image-caption alignment,"We address the problem of grounding free-form textual phrases by using weak supervision from image-caption pairs. We propose a novel end-to-end model that uses caption-to-image retrieval as a downstream task to guide the process of phrase localization. Our method, as a first step, infers the latent correspondences between regions-of-interest (RoIs) and phrases in the caption and creates a discriminative image representation using these matched RoIs. In the subsequent step, this learned representation is aligned with the caption. Our key contribution lies in building this 'caption-conditioned' image encoding, which tightly couples both the tasks and allows the weak supervision to effectively guide visual grounding. We provide extensive empirical and qualitative analysis to investigate the different components of our proposed model and compare it with competitive baselines.

They require multinuclear Radiofrequency coils in order to interrogate the proton (1H) and other nuclei (X-nuclei) in the human body. Such coils provide anatomical images by acquiring (1H) spectra and metabolites information by acquiring spectra of X-nuclei. In addition, the high signal received from proton (1H) is used for B0 shimming purposes. However, the signal strength for these X-nuclei is too low. Hence, the signal-to-noise-ratio is low. The main advantages of using multinuclear Radiofrequency coils are that they speed up the imaging process and reduce the spatial positioning error that might arise when replacing the Radiofrequency coil in order to perform imaging of different nuclei. In addition, comfortable environment will be provided for patients by avoiding any inconvenience of moving out and asking to replace the coils. In this paper, a multi-tunable microstrip transmission line Radiofrequency coil has been designed by using microfluidically tunable Radiofrequency capacitor. This capacitor offers a wide range of capacitance tuning which extends between Cmin=1.76 pF and Cmax=48.7 pF.

Three-dimensional models were created to simulate the clinical situation of replacement of a maxillary central incisor with implants, in a type III bone, with a provisional single crown, loaded with 100 N in a perpendicular direction. The FEA parameters studied were: implant materials—titanium, porous titanium, titanium-zirconia, zirconia, reinforced fiberglass composite (RFC), and polyetheretherketone (PEEK); and abutment materials—titanium, zirconia, RFC, and PEEK; implant macrogeometry—tapered of trapezoidal threads (TTT) and cylindrical of triangular threads (CTT) (ø4.3 mm × 11 mm). Microstrain, von Mises, shear, and maximum and minimum principal stresses in the structures and in peri-implant bone were compared. There was increased stress and strain in peri-implant bone tissue caused by implants of materials with lower elastic modulus (mainly for PEEK and RFC). They also presented higher concentration of stresses in the implant itself (especially RFC). Zirconia implants led to lower stress and strains in peri-implant bone tissue. Less rigid abutments (RFC and PEEK) associated with titanium implants led to higher stress in the implant and in peri-implant bone tissue. The TTT macrogeometry showed a higher stress concentration in the implant and peri-implant bone tissue.

The transition characteristic of the ink apparatus was considered as a natural reaction of this model to various external influences. For research, a single-capacitance model of an ink apparatus is proposed. The flow of ink through a series of rollers and cylinders that form a baseline is considered. To determine the amount of ink, the power conditions of the ink machine are considered. Presumably, the power of the ink unit is pulsed. The amount of ink passing through each contact node in one printing cycle. A model of the distribution of ink layers in the ink apparatus of a sheet printing machine is built. A method for calculating the distribution of ink layers in the ink apparatus for letterpress and offset printing machines has been developed.

For the unsteady mode, the change in the volume of ink in the stream was characterized by the equation of a single-capacitance model of the ink apparatus. The equation of non-stationary mode is obtained. The dynamic characteristic of a single-capacitance model made it possible to determine the unevenness of the ink layer on the form in the case of a pulsed power supply of the ink apparatus. The extension of the proposed methodology to ink apparatus with branched streams of ink makes it possible to use this method for the study of ink apparatus of different designs. Also, the presentation of an ink apparatus in the form of a single-capacitance object creates the prerequisites for a more accurate description of its properties in transition modes.",60071968,Azerbaijan Technical University,Baku,Azerbaijan,['1706'],18.625,0.06904761904761905,0.5035714285714286,0
466,466,Fast update of sliced voxel workpiece models using partitioned swept volumes of three-axis linear tool paths,", part of Springer Nature.This paper presents a new and effective method to achieve fast machining simulation via the frame-sliced voxel representation (FSV-rep) workpiece modeling environment. The FSV-rep workpiece modeling scheme has been demonstrated as an efficient and accurate geometric modeling format for simulating general milling operations. The method presented in this paper specifically targets linear tool paths in three-axis milling. Based on the boundary representation of the linear tool swept volume and the voxel space for modeling the workpiece, it partitions the swept volume into a set of elemental regions, named as the swept volume regions (SVRs). With SVRs, the best performance of FSV-rep workpiece model update in three-axis milling is achieved. In the representative case studies, up to an order of magnitude faster computational performance has been observed compared to the generic approach of approximating the tool swept volume as a set of sampled tool instances. In addition, the quality of the simulated machined surface is much improved due to the use of non-approximated tool swept volumes. The efficient way to use SVRs in FSV-rep workpiece model update and the specific qualities of SVRs enabling the observed superior performance are also discussed in the paper.",60010365,The University of British Columbia,Vancouver,Canada,"['1712', '1706']",24.625,0.28739669421487607,0.44435261707988977,1
467,467,Multiple sensing resources in cognitive radio systems,"r.l.-All rights reserved.– This paper aims to improve the detection accuracy of the energy detection-based cognitive radio system using machine learning while varying the number of cognitive radios used for sensing. It has been an exploratory study in order to identify a suitable number of machine learning-enabled cognitive radios that could be used to improve the performance of the system in terms of sensitivity. Several machine learning techniques have been tested at a low SNR (-25dB) in order to simulate conditions where energy detectors perform poorly. The number of cognitive radios has been varied from three to eighteen in order to explore the potential of increasing the data available for machine learning. Results have revealed that with three cognitive radios, the overall detection accuracy of 97% could be achieved in the energy-detection based system despite the low SNR condition. It has also been discovered that increasing the number of cognitive radios has improved the True positive rate for primary user detection from 98% to >99% with Fine Tree algorithm but at the expense of the overall accuracy of the system. Therefore, demands of specific applications are required in order to identify the number of cognitive radios to employ. Overall, the research presents the potential of using a minimal resource-demanding cognitive radio sensing method (energy detection) for sensing without compromising the detection accuracy of the system. It also improves the spectrum utilization of the system by reducing the probability of false alarms considerably. It highlights improvements that can be made to the conventional energy-detection system through machine learning while retaining the simplicity of the cognitive radio system.

Firstly, several influencing factors of the IS between FPSC enterprises were identified according to the relevant literature, namely, the IS degree, information absorption capacity, the IS cost, incentive coefficient, penalty coefficient, risk coefficient and synergy coefficient. Based on these factors, the author constructed an evolutionary game model for the decision-making of the IS. Then, the dynamic evolution of the IS between FPSC enterprises was simulated on the Matlab, followed by the discussion on the impact of each factor on the IS decisions of each side. The results show that the IS between FPSC enterprises is promoted by the IS degree, information absorption capacity, incentive coefficient, penalty coefficient and synergy coefficient, but suppressed by the IS cost and risk coefficient. Finally, four countermeasures were suggested to enhance the IS between FPSC enterprises, including raising the IS awareness, enhancing information absorption capacity, creating an IS mechanism, and strengthening IS coordination.

478,478,Dynamics of Population Distribution by Patches,"Abstract: This paper considers the patch selection by a population without having full information about the utility of the patch, i.e., the amount of its energy resources. This problem is related to the optimal foraging theory. According to U. Dieckmann’s suggestion, the population distribution by patches should be modeled according to the utility function that takes into account the amount of resources per patch, the population–patch distance, and the extent to which the population is aware of the amount of resources in the patch. In this case, the population distribution by patches is described using the Boltzmann distribution. Dieckmann considers a static problem without taking into account the change in the position of the population over time. In this paper, we suggest a dynamic system that describes the population distribution by patches, which depends on the utility of patches that changes over time as a result of variations in the population–patch distance. That said, the Boltzmann distribution is a particular solution of the derived system of ordinary differential equations. The Lyapunov stability condition for the Boltzmann distribution is derived. The patch utility functions dependent on the distance to and the population’s awareness of the patch are introduced. As a result, in the 2D case the R2 space in divided in preferential utility domains. This partition generalizes G.F.

479,479,Bladder tumor grading and staging prediction of magnetic resonance imaging based on transfer learning,"Bladder cancer ranks fourth in male malignant tumors and eighth in mortality. Early detection of bladder tumors is important for preventing bladder cancer, reducing mortality, and improving patients' quality of life. In this paper, we used the deep learning model such as Resnet-v2-50 and Inceptionv3 to predict Bladder tumor grading and staging. When the model was trained and tested, the experiment data set coming from the Chinese University Computer Design Competition-Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Challenge, was used. The test set which accounted for 10% of the data set was randomly disrupted. First, the method of transfer learning was used to train the corresponding network where the convolutional layer parameters were fixed and the fully connected layer was retrained. Then for this data set, we compared the impact of three improved strategies on its classification accuracy. The three improved strategies were that: 1. Doing data augmentation by randomly changing brightness and contrast of images and then added the changed images to the training set. 2. Features extracted by Resnet-v2-50 and Inception-v3 were stitched before they were sent into the fully connected layer. 3. Combining the previous two methods. The experiments results showed that for the grading prediction, the inception-v3 model with data augmentation had the highest classification accuracy of 95.5%; for the staging prediction, stitching models based on the inception-v3 and Resnet-v2-50 without data augmentation had the highest classification accuracy of 92.8%. It implied the effectiveness of these two improved strategies (feature stitching and data augmentation) for different classification tasks.

482,482,CDMA-based multi-domain communications network for marine robots,"This paper reports on a cross-domain communication system for marine robots based on code-division multiple access (CDMA). The underwater communications channel is a difficult transmission medium due to its link quality variability which depends on location and the application. It also depends on environmental parameters which can vary temporally from hours to days to months to season. Understanding the channel characteristics for data transmission is essential to the development and evaluation of existing or new MAC and Routing Level protocols which better utilize the limited resources within this unpredictable channel. CDMA is the most promising physical layer and multiple access technique for underwater acoustic sensor networks because it: i) is robust to frequency selective fading, ii) compensates for multi-path effects at the receiver, and iii) allows receivers to distinguish among signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple devices. For these reasons, CDMA increases channel re-use and reduces packet retransmissions, which results in decreased energy consumption and increased network throughput. Development of a framework for autonomous co-ordination and networking of marine robot teams from extended ranges to transmit images/information from underwater to above water is proposed using CDMA which is a complete stack of communications protocol from the physical to the application layer for marine robots that spans multiple domains, i.e. under, on and above water. Simulation of the proposed network was performed using network simulator-3 (NS-3). The proposed protocol edge CDMA properties provide multiple access to the limited underwater bandwidth whereas previous reported work only considered CDMA for the physical layer.

For a given corpus, the process of word-embedding is to embed each word onto multi-dimensional space such that semantic similarities between similar words are retained. While learning the similarity as encapsulated in the training corpus, the embedding process inadvertently captures many other inherent features present in the corpus. One such thing is the bias arising out of stereotyping present in almost all the corpus no matter how extensively used and trusted they are. We study this aspect of word-embedding in the context of Hindi language. We show that many gender-neutral words in Hindi are mapped to vectors which are inclined towards one gender or the other in multi-dimensional space. We propose a new algorithm of debiasing and demonstrate its efficacy in the context of Hindi language. Further, we build a SVM-based classifier that determines whether a gender-neutral word is classified as neutral or otherwise.

Recently, deep learning based approach has brought excellent ability to deal with this issue. However, these methods always generate blurred edge and distorted details, which makes the inpainting images unreal. Besides, assessment for generated images is also challenging. Traditional assessment way uses various formulations, which only shows the partial image condition or distorted degree compared to original images, so this method cannot correctly reflect people's perception. To deal with these problems, we propose a multi-scale generative model which can gradually generate novel text to avoid distorted details, and the multi-scale losses can also eliminate blurred edges between inpainting results and the original region. To evaluate images, we also propose a deep convolutional neural network to do image quality assessment, which is closer to human perception.

Nevertheless, discovering topics in opinions continues being challenging; due to opinions are generally short and informally written. Besides, opinions do not have a defined structure in several paragraphs; they are presented most of the time as a composition in a paragraph. In this paper, we propose a method to detect polarity in opinions by topics. Our proposal contributes to the fuzzy polarity calculation of detected topics in Spanish opinions. This method is comprised of three main steps: (1) preprocessing, (2) topic detection and (3) fuzzy polarity detection. It is important to notice the added values of this paper are: (1) the topic detection proposal based on the semantic processing when applying the clustering algorithm on opinion sentences, and (2) the evaluation of different aggregation operators for determining the opinion polarity from a fuzzy logic perspective. Aiming at assessing the quality of the resultant polarity detection by topics, we have conducted two main experiments over the Spanish corpus of opinions about Andalusian Hotels from the TripAdvisor site. The results have shown that our method is able to detect the topics correctly, as well as calculating their opinion polarities.",60052951,Universidad Central de Las Villas,Santa Clara,Cuba,['1700'],22.454545454545453,0.07061403508771931,0.4149122807017543,0

495,495,Virtual MIMO transmissions for underwater acoustic communications with moving platforms,"Underwater acoustic communications with multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is critically important because it supports the coordinated team mission in the ocean. AUVs, as compact mobile platforms, have limited computing resources and physical space, thus impeding the adoption of spectrally-efficient acoustic communication strategies including multi-antennas transmissions. For example, only a single transmitter is installed on an AUV. Allocation of limited communication resources is also a critical issue when multiple vehicles are involved in the mission. Here, we propose a virtual multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) strategy for communications with multiple AUVs. The virtual MIMO strategy selects the transmitters from a subset of AUVs to form a virtual transmit array. The objective is to increase spectral efficiency for the uplink, referring to the transmission connection from the AUVs to moored communication base stations. A user selection algorithm is used to determine the active AUV subset for data transmissions, to ensure the fairness in access to the time slots. Adaptive modulation is combined to improve the throughput further. The user selection and modulation choice are decided by predicted data rates derived from the communication range rather than the channel state information, thus avoiding the high overhead. The performance of the underwater virtual MIMO scheme has been examined in computer simulations, where the vehicle-specific mission tracks, simulated acoustic communication channels from BELLHOP, and time reversal communication receivers were used. The simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved a high overall throughput in a scenario with five AUVs. Further, the assignment fairness of time slots was considered while maximizing the overall throughput.",60025371,The University of Alabama,Tuscaloosa,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",19.692307692307693,-0.0013809523809523744,0.39614285714285713,1
496,496,Compressed underwater acoustic communications for dynamic interaction with underwater vehicles,"Underwater vehicles are utilized in various applications including underwater data-collection missions. The tethered connection constrains the mission both in distance traveled and number of vehicles that can run in the same area, while the addition of acoustic communications onto the vehicles grants them several functionalities. However, due to the low bandwidth of the underwater acoustic channel-which leads to low data rates-and the time overhead imposed by both the channel propagation delay and the processing delay by the acoustic modems, efficient protocols are required. In this paper, an implicit data-compression and transmission protocol is proposed to carry out environmental monitoring missions such as adaptive sampling of physical and chemical parameters in the water. In a semi-autonomous manner between the vehicle and the control center, both sides keep silent in data transmission as long as they can estimate and predict the actions of the other side, unless environmental data and/or kinematic data are found to be unpredictable.

With evaluating situation information reasonably and making the decision correctly, the underwater robot could accomplish the task excellently. Situation assessment is the process that transforms environmental information collected by sensors into situation information, and decision-making is the process that uses situation assessment results to guide the robot's action. However, the problems of poor objectivity, low precision and low efficiency often exist in robot situation assessment and decision-making, which has attracted the interest of many researchers. This paper proposes a method of situation assessment and decision-making for underwater robots. Firstly, multi-agent situation assessment factors are selected to build a dataset and used as the input data. A BP neural network is used to train the mapping relationship from the evaluation factor data to the situation scores.

Challenges of identity authentication lie in the verification of the ID card provided by the user and the information extraction from the user's ID card. To meet the challenge, an identity authentication framework is proposed, which can extract and verify personal information through face verification and ID image recognition. The identity authentication is realized by the proposed face verification model which is called Inception-ResNet Face Embedding (IRFE). IRFE uses an Inception-ResNet structure to ensure a good feature extraction aiming at accurate face verification.

In particular, we propose a new multiple access protocol, referred to as delayed-reward DRL multiple access (DR-DLMA). The system objective is to find an optimal channel access strategy that maximizes the network throughput, by making full use of the available time-slots resulted from the long propagation delay or not used by other nodes in the network. We also give the upper bound on the network throughput in various cases as our benchmark, and show that the DR-DLMA can achieve a near-optimal performance with all the different propagation delays. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol in heterogeneous and homogeneous networks, respectively. When coexisting with one FW-ALOHA node, the maximum gap between the network throughput achieved by the DR-DLMA and the optimal solution is within 10%. In homogeneous networks, we demonstrate that DR-DLMA outperforms traditional MAC protocols for UWANs (e.g., slotted FAMA and DOTS) in terms of the network throughput. Particularly, in the four-node network with a maximum propagation delay of 4, DR-DLMA yields 470% and 190% higher throughput on average than slotted FAMA and DOTS, respectively.",60018205,Xiamen University,Xiamen,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",25.0,0.05352437417654809,0.3630764163372859,1

Firstly, a lightweight neural network is utilized to extract informative features from the video in the initial tracking process. Secondly, the extracted features are processed by discriminant correlation filter to get the correlation information of two adjacent frames which is used in the following process of inverse fast Fourier transformation to obtain the response map. The position of the predicted target is then updated by getting the maximum value of the response map. Furthermore, the position predicted in the previous frame is cropped and expanded as the input in the prediction of the next frame to achieve online tracking and feature updating.

Rational grazing scheme can avoid eco-environment damage caused by overgrazing, and it can ensure the livestock normal feeding. The rationality of rotational grazing management is affected by many complex and dynamic factors. This paper establishes a model of rotational grazing assignment based on grass resource leveling. Firstly, each rotational grazing plot's forage yield in each rotational grazing assignment stage is predicted by seasonal prediction method. Then, constrained by the rotational grazing plots' forage yield and livestock's forage demand, a dynamic rotational grazing assignment model is established, which combines the assignment model and carrying capacity constraint. Thus, the maximum edible forage in a rotational grazing cycle is contained and the distribution of the corresponding rotational grazing plots is determined. In each rotational grazing cycle, each rotational grazing plot can only be assigned once, which embodies the principle of ecological protection. And livestock have as much forage as possible in a rotational grazing cycle. Finally, through a case analysis, a feasible solution in a rotational grazing cycle is obtained. Through taking carrying capacity in each rotational grazing assignment stage as a standard to scheme the grazing order in each plot, the uncertainty of eco-environment is better reflected. A reasonable decision scheme of dynamic rotational grazing can make resources used efficiently in time and space.",60019499,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing,China,['1700'],19.25,0.15625,0.5052083333333333,0

517,517,Binary convolutional neural network with high accuracy and compression rate,"In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme to train a binary convolutional neural network that has high compression rate and classification accuracy. In binary neural networks, weights and activations are binarized to +1 or-1. This brings two benefits: 1)The model size is greatly reduced; 2)Arithmetic operations can be replaced by more efficient bitwise operations based on binary values, resulting in much faster inference speed and lower power consumption. However, binarizing neural networks will result in severe prediction accuracy degradation compared to their counterpart full-precision networks. To solve this problem, we apply three strategies: 1) By summarizing the previous work, we conclude that the large performance loss of binary networks is mainly caused by the binarization of activations, so we propose to apply multiple banalizations to activations. Compared to apply multiple banalizations to weights, it effectively maintains compression rate while improving the accuracy; 2) In order to alleviate gradient mismatches between the forward and backward propagation, We adopt a more precise differentiable approximation when calculating the gradients in backward propagation; 3) In order to further improve the compression rate, we also binarize the last layer with the help of a scale layer.",60003970,Zhejiang University,Hangzhou,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",32.0,0.24102040816326528,0.3989455782312925,1
518,518,Comparison of underwater ambient noise based on past two years data for dongshan offshore,"Due to the fluctuation of underwater ambient noise on different receiving stations, we measured the Dongshan Offshore underwater ambient noise in May 2018, which can be used for optimizing transmitting power by adjusting the signal-to-noise (SNR), and make better use of the transmitting energy for underwater acoustic networks (UWAN). In June 2019, we measured the Dongshan Offshore underwater ambient noise in the same 18 stations again, crossing a distance of 50 nautical miles. In this extended abstract, we will analyze the power spectrum density (PSD) of noise with different frequencies and present the comparison based on the past two years data. The result shows that the PSD fluctuation of noise with frequency below 10 kHz is large, and it is related to the depth and the distance to the coast. However, the PSD fluctuation is steady when the frequency is larger than 10 kHz in the past two years. This can help us to set the proper transmitting power in each acoustic transmission link before deploying the UWAN.",60018205,Xiamen University,Xiamen,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",28.0,0.019688644688644688,0.356043956043956,1

520,520,Machine learning augmentation: An integrative detection approach,"The performance of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms is strongly dependant on the quality of the image training data. Therefore, given available image data, every classifier has certain limitations on the overall classification, detection, and segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose an ""integrative approach"" to enhance the two-class (bi-class) image classification and segmentation performance. The integrative approach augments the segmentation capabilities of the off-line trained ML classifier for pixel-based object detection in images by using graph and weights for pixels. The approach integrates the ML model, graph, pixel weights, the neighborhood weights and the graph-cut. For an evaluation, we use two bi-class pixel-based object detection problems of pixel-based skin detection and pixel-based sky color detection in images. An evaluation of the Bayesian Network (BayesNet), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest and the Histogram approach of Jones and Rehg (JR) based on the two datasets of skin and one dataset of the sky images reveals that the proposed integrative approach improves the detection performance in all the cases compared to using the classifiers alone.

The contradiction between group benefit and individual benefit hinders group cooperation and further is detrimental to group performance. Thus, when measuring or promoting group performance, how to predict and avoid hitchhiking has become a key issue. Classical game models are widely used as specific backgrounds to explore cooperation, which are relatively easy to explain but hard to apply. To find the commonly used methods to promote group performance, this paper abstracts the basic characteristics of group events, and then influence the strategic choices of the group members by adjusting event characteristics.

However, these methods are based on the supervising information provided by the category labels and do not consider the potential of the deep feature space. Therefore, we propose a novel network called identity-preserved multi-task convolutional neural network (IPMT-CNN), which combines an identity subnet with an auxiliary age subnet. In the meanwhile, the identity-preserved module is added to the deep feature space to constrain the deep features, making the deep features learned by the convolution unit have preliminary age-invariant property. The two subnets extract the identity-related features and the age-related features from the deep features shared by the convolution unit, respectively. Identity-related features are used for final cross-age face verification. Through multi-task supervised learning, the network can obtain strong discriminative age-invariant face features with identity-preserved capability.

The data source to the filter combines both the Eulerian flow map with the Lagrangian mobile sensor data stream. The depth-averaged flow is modeled as two components, the tidal and the non-tidal flow component. The tidal flow is modeled with ADCIRC (Advanced Three-Dimensional Circulation Model), while the non-tidal flow field is modeled by a set of spatial basis functions and their time series coefficients. The spatial basis functions are the principal modes derived by performing EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) analysis on the historical surface flow field measured by high frequency radar (HFR), and the temporal coefficients of the spatial basis function are modeled by an LSTM neural network. The Kalman Filter is performed to combine the dynamics derived from the LSTM network, and the observations from the glider flow estimation data.

540,540,A stratified linear sound speed profile simplification method for localization correction,"Localization is important for underwater sensor networks as the validity of data and the maintenance of nodes both need location information. Because of the Snell effect caused by non-uniform distribution of sound speed, the signal propagation path is curved, which would lead to errors when traditional linear propagation localization models are used. Sound speed profiles (SSPs) can be used to correct the signal trajectory error according to the ray theory, so as to improve the localization accuracy. To simplify the expression of original SSPs and reduce the computational complexity of ray tracing while guaranteeing the accuracy, we propose a stratified linear SSP simplification method with a distance-minimization-based equal-interval control points searching (DM-EICPS) algorithm. Simulation results show that, compared with other curve approximation algorithms, the DM-EICPS algorithm not only generates simplified SSPs rapidly, but also achieves good SSP approximation accuracy. Moreover, the corrected localization accuracy with simplified SSPs is an order of magnitude higher than the linear propagation model, and the time overhead of ray tracing with simplified SSPs is obviously reduced compared to original SSPs.",60029306,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",29.166666666666668,0.2522727272727273,0.6386363636363637,1

543,543,Difference in Differences in Marketing Performance Measurement," Published by Elsevier B.V.Marketing performance measurement is important in retail companies, it is critical for the budget planning and adjustment of marketing strategies and tactics over time. Compared to digital online marketing, such as social media advertisers where tagging techniques [1] can be applied to track the lifecycle of the consumption and the customer's behaviours, traditional TV and radio advertising will be harder to evaluate at the individual level. Instead, common approach in this scenario is to study the relationship between ads spend and sales. This paper presents a casual inference methodology - ""Difference in Differences""(DID) on the application of TV marketing measurement. Instead of building direct relationship between ads and sales, we attempt to create an experimental research design and study the differential effect on a 'treatment group' versus a 'control group'. In order to study the performance of advertising in a city, the treatment group is sales performance during and after TV advertisings and the control group is the statistical model that mimics the sales of the same city without ads influence. It is proved that the model can significantly predict the sales of city in nature by considering its past sales, the neighbourhood districts and weather conditions.

This paper proposes a text sentiment analysis model (CNN-BiGRU) combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU). The model first uses CNN to extract the local static features of the text, and then extracts the sequence features of the text through BiGRU, and then the two unidirectional GRU layers further reduce the extracted features. Finally, the Sigmoid classifier is used for the final sentiment classification. Through the self-built Douban film and television commentary dataset, compared with the CNN-BLSTM model, the classification accuracy rate increased by 2.52%, and the training rate increased by 41.43%, which verified the validity of the model.",60026981,Xi'an University of Technology,Xi'an,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",30.6,0.09642857142857143,0.5711904761904762,1

In particular, SPC represent the syntagmatic words of the context through a vocabulary co-occurrence matrix, and extract a likely embedding for a better joint predicting of all paradigmatic words to fill in the input context. During the error back propagation, our model focus on the salient statistical structure by allowing a sub-network to approximate the nonzero sub-matrix. Finally, we trained our model on a public Wikipedia corpus and evaluated on word analogy, word similarity tasks and documents clustering and classification. The results show that our method yields almost 4% improvement on word analogy and nearly 3% improvement on word similarity tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

546,546,Control of an autonomous mobile robot in cluttered environments guided by a single CCD camera,Control of an autonomous robot moving in cluttered environments guided by a single CCD camera is described in this paper. The objective is to guide the mobile robot to arrive at a goal pose (position and orientation) started from an initial pose in the environment where there may be static obstacles that can be observed by the camera. The control scheme consists in three modules: the control module which ensures the exponential tracking to a desired trajectory; the on-line path/trajectory planning module which plans the desired path using LOS (Light-of-Sight) strategy and then parametrizes it into a trajectory; and the depth-estimation module which takes a sequence of target image along the path in the CCD camera mounted in the mobile robot to estimate the target Cartesian coordinate in the inertial frame and passes it to the path/trajectory module. The trajectory tracking controller and the depth observer are devised relying on the contraction analysis ensuring the exponential convergence in both designs. Simulations are included to illustrate the control scheme.,60032442,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,Ciudad de México,Mexico,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",33.6,0.12976190476190477,0.319047619047619,1
547,547,Prolonging the lifetime of underwater sensor networks under sinkhole attacks,"Severe characteristics and convergecast nature of underwater acoustic channels make underwater sensor networks (USNs) vulnerable to malicious attacks. One of the most malicious attacks in USNs is the sinkhole attack, where an adversary first captures a sensor node and then lures the surrounding network traffic by using false routing information. Later, the captured node can forward the captured network traffic to the intruder or drop the packets. Sinkhole attacks negatively affect the lifetime, end-to-end latency, and energy-efficiency of USNs since lured nodes spend energy in an unbalanced manner and the forwarding process introduces additional latency. In this work, we investigate the lifetime, end-to-end latency, and energy consumption performances of USNs under sinkhole attacks within an integer programming (IP) model which maximizes USNs lifetime. Our results show that if half of the nodes in the network are lured by a sinkhole node, the network lifetime decreases at a minimum of 71%; the end-to-end latency and energy consumption are increased at least by 89% and 77% as compared to the performance metrics which are obtained in the case of no sinkhole attacks.",60104502,TED Üniversitesi,Ankara,Turkey,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",30.0,-0.11458333333333334,0.36249999999999993,1

550,550,Target recognition method based on feature fusion,"In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the problem of target recognition and classification has made a breakthrough. Single mode data cannot summarize the feature information of the target well, multi-view and multi-modal representation learning become a fast-growing direction in the field of machine learning and data mining. In the case that the single modal data sample is not enough, the multi-modal analysis method can not only make up for the difficult training problem caused by insufficient data, but also enhance the representation ability by extracting the complementary relationship between different view of data. Multi-model can improve the accuracy of target recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes an image feature extraction based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and a feature fusion method in the feature layer to better solve the classification problem. This method mainly consists of three steps. First, a convolutional neural network is trained and used to extract features of the images. Secondly, selecting an appropriate dimension in the extracted image features and fusing it with the basic attribute features of the target. Finally, the newly formed fusion features are used to train the classifier and perform comparative verification on the data set. Through experiments, it is finally found that multi-feature fusion can better represent the target, achieving better results on the target classification and recognition problem.",60025272,University of Tokyo,Tokyo,Japan,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",22.4,0.06895648211437684,0.5276201868307131,1

The three key exchange solutions are the Fully Hashed Menezes-Qu-Vanstone, the Hashed One-pass Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (both based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography) and Diffie-Hellman. Certificate distribution is performed via the Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone protocol (implicit) and by X.509 certificates (explicit). Combinations of the selected protocols are considered to secure multipath-based communications in UASNs of different size. Investigated metrics concern the energy consumed and the time required to complete the exchange of keys between two nodes.

555,555,Learning spatial awareness to improve crowd counting,"The aim of crowd counting is to estimate the number of people in images by leveraging the annotation of center positions for pedestrians' heads. Promising progresses have been made with the prevalence of deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Existing methods widely employ the Euclidean distance (i.e., L-2 loss) to optimize the model, which, however, has two main drawbacks: (1) the loss has difficulty in learning the spatial awareness (i.e., the position of head) since it struggles to retain the high-frequency variation in the density map, and (2) the loss is highly sensitive to various noises in crowd counting, such as the zero-mean noise, head size changes, and occlusions. Although the Maximum Excess over SubArrays (MESA) loss has been previously proposed by∼cite{nips-10} to address the above issues by finding the rectangular subregion whose predicted density map has the maximum difference from the ground truth, it cannot be solved by gradient descent, thus can hardly be integrated into the deep learning framework. In this paper, we present a novel architecture called SPatial Awareness Network (SPANet) to incorporate spatial context for crowd counting. The Maximum Excess over Pixels (MEP) loss is proposed to achieve this by finding the pixel-level subregion with high discrepancy to the ground truth. To this end, we devise a weakly supervised learning scheme to generate such region with a multi-branch architecture. The proposed framework can be integrated into existing deep crowd counting methods and is end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks show that our method can significantly improve the performance of baselines. More remarkably, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all benchmark datasets.",60027950,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,United States,"['1712', '1707']",26.6,0.042101449275362315,0.4941304347826087,1

The primary issue involved in hole-making operations is a tool travel time. It is often necessary to find the optimal sequence of operations so that the total processing cost of hole-making operations can be minimized. In this work, therefore an attempt is made to reduce the total tool travel of hole-making operations by applying a relatively new optimization algorithm known as modified shuffled frog leaping for determining the optimal sequence of operations. Modification is made in the existing shuffled frog-leaping algorithm by introducing three parameters with their positive values to widen the search capability of existing algorithms. A case study of the printed circuit board is considered in this work to demonstrate the proposed approach.

How to measure the Chinese youth's political attitudes? Their political enthusiasm, participation in major political events, and recognition of government work, can reflect their political attitudes to some extent. In recent years, their attitudes towards anti-corruption issue are a measure of their most critical political attitudes. Based on a survey experiment frame, this paper examines their attitudes towards China's anti-corruption and influencing factors on it. From aspect of the young individuals, the young people with different demographic characteristics take on different attention to anti-corruption, and then produce different evaluations of it. To investigate the influence of external factors, the study designs a controllable factor - media coverage on anti-corruption. This empirical study shows that, the effect of media coverage on the young people's evaluations dependents on their individual characteristics. In the end, this paper suggests the government care about the young people who make low evaluation of anti-corruption situation and take strategies for inspiring their political enthusiasms and improving their political trust.",60014337,Capital University of EcoNomics and Business,Beijing,China,['1700'],23.375,0.10875000000000003,0.3158333333333333,0

In particular, we investigate the classification of three different swimming styles; freestyle, butterfly, and backstroke. Experiments are conducted in a swimming pool to capture acoustic micro-Doppler signatures produced by the different swimming styles. Two acoustic hydrophones are used underwater; one to transmit a single tone signal in the direction of a swimmer and the other to receive the reflected waveform from the swimmer's body. We apply joint time-frequency analysis on the received acoustic signal to extract the micro-Doppler signatures present in the spectrogram. Each of these swimming style activities presents their own unique micro-Doppler signatures. To classify the acoustic micro-Doppler signatures, we explore a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) algorithm. Spectrogram can be considered as an image in which case applying DCNN can serve well for feature recognition purposes. We show that using the spectrogram images the DCNN algorithm can classify different swimming styles performed on the surface of the water with fairly high accuracy.

Multi-view learning is to combine multiple view data of the same entity for data classification, thereby improving learning performance. Previous multi-view research methods mainly concentrate on the relationship between different data views for classification problems. However, when the data is in high dimensions, it is necessary to perform feature selection in the multi-view data classification process. In this paper, we proposed a Multi-view Support Vector Machine Classification with Feature Selection (MSVMCFS) algorithm, which can not only classify multi-view data, but also select features for each view data in the process of classification. In the model, feature selection is performed by the l1 norm sparsity regularization, and consistency and complementarity between the two views are maintained.

570,570,A fuzzy linguistic supported framework to increase Artificial Intelligence intelligibility for subject matter experts," Published by Elsevier B.V.The application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the decision making processes is more widespread in the industry than ever before. Yet, one of the most critical show-stoppers is the communication gap between the machine learning (ML) models and the experts community. On one hand, the output of ML is often not intelligible for experts, in spite of the latest advances in explainable AI. On the other hand, the expert knowledge, rarely completely present in the available data, but rather in the heads of the experts, needs to be connected to the data-driven insights created by the ML model. In this paper we first identify the most critical situations with a manifest intelligibility gap and then propose a framework supported by fuzzy linguistic modelling techniques to close this gap. In addition, we present its integration into the end-to-end decision making flow, from data gathering to the execution and evaluation and we show the output of our approach with practical examples.",60027844,Universidad de Granada,Granada,Spain,['1700'],27.333333333333332,0.15576923076923077,0.4775641025641025,0

Once the positioning error accumulates to a certain extent, the mission may fail. Therefore, correcting the positioning error during flight is a critical task in the route planning. In this paper, the NSGA-II algorithm is used to solve the optimal trajectory programming for intelligent aircraft under multi-constraint conditions. Firstly, the optimal trajectory programming model of the intelligent aircraft is established by the flight strategy which put the least correction point and the shortest route as limits. Then, with regarding to the model corresponding to the multi-constrained nonlinear optimization problem, the NSGA-II algorithm is used to solve the problem. Finally, the optimal trajectory programming for intelligent aircraft is proved to be promising in terms of effective-ness and system efficiency by simulation under the conditions of guaranteed turning radius, horizontal error and vertical error.",60024542,South China University of Technology,Guangzhou,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",21.142857142857142,0.20302197802197802,0.636904761904762,1
573,573,Generalized lesion detector based on convolutional neural network,"In current computer-aided diagnostic systems, existing detection functions are usually only for a specific type of lesion, such as skin lesions, pulmonary nodule lesions and liver lesions. However, in actual clinical diagnosis, many lesions are actually related. For example, pulmonary nodular lesions may metastasize and spread to lymph node areas or other body parts. The detection of a single site is not conducive to the doctor's comprehensive diagnosis of the condition. Multi-site lesion detection can detect lesion metastasis and treat it earlier, and can also explore the relationship between different lesions. In response to this situation, this thesis uses the Deeplesion dataset to establish a general lesion detection framework that can detect possible lesions through CT images of different parts of the body. Compared with the existing single-path computer-aided diagnosis system, this thesis studies and implements a general lesion detection system to explore the relationship between different lesions. This will help doctors to make a comprehensive clinical diagnosis and visualize the results. This thesis based on the Faster R-CNN network model. First it denoises and enhances the CT images. Then, the VGG16 network is used for feature extraction, and the feature map is obtained through the RPN network to obtain candidate suggestion regions. In view of the misdetection of missed detection, this thesis introduces a Gaussian weighted penalty function to improve the non-maximum suppression.

We attempt to apply the multi-class extreme learning machine (ELM) to learning from label proportions (LLP). With a structure similar to neural network, ELM possesses higher computational speed and better generalization ability. As a result, it is suitable to deal with large-scale and multi-class problems. LLP is a learning problem, which classifies training data into bags where only the label proportions of each class in each bag is available. Furthermore, in order to maintain the stable model accuracy when the bag sizes increasing, we manage to add small number of labeled samples in our model, called LLP-ELM with in a semi-supervised learning framework.

579,579,On connectivity of wireless underwater sensor networks using MI-assisted acoustic distributed beamforming,"In wireless underwater sensor networks (WUSNs), network connectivity is one of the most fundamental problems as it can directly impact the network lifetime and operation. Distributed beamforming can improve the connectivity by extending the communication range. However, the traditional acoustic communication results in the problem of too large synchronization error between nodes. Magnetic induction (MI) communication is a promising candidate thanks to several unique features such as small transmission delay, constant channel behavior and high bandwidth. WUSNs using MI-assisted acoustic distributed beamforming (MADB) can achieve better connectivity performance by enable the transmission range of nodes. In WUSNs-MADB, due to the underwater channel characteristics and the heterogeneous network architecture, the connectivity analysis is much more complicated than that of WUSNs.

Artificial Intelligence and automation technologies are reshaping the career market. Everyday, new jobs appear and new skills are added to the scope of existing job profiles. At the same time, some skills that once were assumed to be ""must-haves"" for particular jobs are no longer requested and some jobs are even becoming obsolete. The speed of changes as well as the increasing complexity of the job market introduce a key new challenge: there is no clear definition for a particular job in terms of skills and scope and consequently, people holding the same job title cannot be assumed to be actually doing the same thing. In addition, applicants find difficult to develop career paths, as the mapping of skills to particular jobs are fuzzier than ever before. In this article, we present a novel approach to homogenize the job definition, gathering first subject matter expertise using semantic expansion techniques on collaborative wikies, applying a word embeddings supported method to mine the skills from existing job posts and finally executing a semantic matching algorithm to converge to a consistent skills mapping.

In NPP, the film thickness over plant acts a critical stage in the safety and economic points. Therefore, the investigation on the phenomenon of film over the plate is significant, and its flow characteristics are the main study point of the water film examination. The water film phenomenon over the surface has a considerable influence on the steam-water separation efficiency, emergency cooling system, and economic points. Nevertheless, it is important to express the water film characteristics and the inclined angles of the plate because both phenomena describe the technique by an algorithm that takes more time to calculate as well as each experiment has its condition. Consequently, this research suggests a technique to describe the water film characteristics and the inclined angles by using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detail images. The DCNN algorithm is used to acquiring the feature of the water film image information while the air stream in the experimental section rectangular channel of the plate seized by the fast camera is steadily increased. As well, the seven-method of SVM is applied to categorize water film pictures and determine the water film remarkable point over the plate by the training set, testing group.

592,592,Extension Support Vector Machine for Extension Classification," Published by Elsevier B.V.Support vector machine (SVM) method has been successfully applied to classification, in which a classifying rule between features and class is pursued. Sometimes, a specific transformation can influence the feature values of an example, according to the classifying rule, further leading to a possible change of its corresponding class. How to apply such examples to obtain knowledge about the transformation is a new issue, called extension classification (EC). In this paper, an extension support vector machine (ESVM) is developed, in which a mathematic model involving a series of sub-models between feature values of the examples before and after transformation is considered. Dependent function is established to replace the classifying rule. Based on dependent function, nonlinear constraints are requested to ensure the reasonability of the model, in which sub-models are coupled with each other. By introducing the concept of dependent radius, each original constraint is decoupled into several linear sub-constraints so that each sub-model can be established independently. For each sub-model, a non-convex example-dependence loss function is proposed and concave-convex programming (CCCP) procedure is suggested to process the non-convexity.

593,593,Training-based adaptive channel tracking for correlated underwater acoustic channels,"Multipath arrivals in many underwater acoustic channels are cross-correlated due to recent study. By exploiting the cross-correlation of mulipath arrivals, an efficient type of channel tracking for underwater acoustic channel is proposed by decomposing the cross-correlation into the channel principal components with low rank and the corresponding channel subspace. To track the channel, the channel principal components are modeled as an autoregressive (AR) process, and a Kalman filter tracks the channel components based on this AR model. The channel subspace is also tracked by recursive algorithms. However, these multi-procedure algorithms leave many undecided parameters which can affect the performance substantially. And the mismatch of the priori model is inevitable for underwater acoustic channels. In this paper, we present a training-based adaptive channel tracking algorithm. With the help of a short prior sequence of data, the parameters for the trackers are obtained through training. And an adaptive Kalman filter is used to correct the mismatch of the model which is also training-based. Performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated with real sea data.

595,595,Risk factors identification and evolution analysis from textual risk disclosures for insurance industry," Published by Elsevier B.V.In the traditional risk management of insurance industry, companies mainly focus on business risks related to insurance products in their daily operation, but ignores the harms of other risk types. There is no consensus on what are the risk factors faced by insurance companies totally, which reduces the effectiveness of risk management especially when the company is at a particular stage. By using text mining method, this paper comprehensively identifies risk factors faced by insurance companies and analyses the evolution of risks over time from companies' own risk disclosures, which is the premise of effective risk prevention and management. Based on 1682 Form 10-K filings from 214 U.S. financial firms over 2006-2018, 49 risk factor topics are identified over the four stages, 14 of which are shared by all the four stages and risk factors specific to a stage are also identified. In addition, there are significant differences in the types of key risks faced by insurance companies at different stages.

596,596,Turbo equalization for underwater acoustic faster-than-nyquist signaling system,"Underwater acoustic communications (UAC) is the main technical means for underwater cableless transmission. Due to the serious multi-path, time-varying and Doppler effects of underwater acoustic channel (UWAC), the received signals are overlapped and distorted, which brings serious inter symbol interference (ISI). On the other hand, the limited bandwidth and the low signal-to-noise ratio in UWAC seriously limit the transmission rate. Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling can break the restriction of Nyquist criterion and achieve higher transmission rate, but at the cost of introducing inherent ISI. Therefore, how to eliminate the serious ISI at the receiving end of UAC-FTN system with low complexity has become the main problem that restricts the application of FTN technology in UAC. To solve this problem, in the paper, a turbo receiver with tridirectional channel estimation scheme and low-complexity soft information interaction is proposed for the UAC-FTN system. The channel impulse response during one data block is obtained by estimating the channel parameters of the front, back and middle parts of this block.

597,597,Arabic twitter corpus for crisis response messages classification,"Twitter has been used intensively by Arab users after the crisis caused by the ""Arab Spring"". Humanity crisis in countries such as Yemen and Syria led people to utilize Twitter as a crisis communication tool to overcome uncertainty. A variety of crisis-related messages is sent to enquire about different issues. The content of these messages is used by humanitarian organizations to form the response plan. However, most of these messages are in the Arabic language that covers information about the humanitarian crisis. Classifying their content relay on annotated corpus. Though, most of the crisis corpora available are in the English language and focusing on natural hazards. In this paper, we present the first humanity crisis corpus in the Arabic language using Twitter data which annotated data into five-crisis categories. Then, classification was performed through three different experiments using TFIDF, lexical, morphology and word embedding features. After that supervised learning algorithms were trained with and without word2vec models. Results indicate that classifiers are detecting more Arabic crisis-message classes when they are trained with skip-gram with TFIDF, lexical and morphology extracted features. Moreover, we generated Arabic crisis word embedding with similarity weighting trained by word2vec techniques in each crisis category.

The suppression of the self-interference remains the main obstacle to achieve IBFD in the ocean. Limited work in the literature has been done to characterize the self-interference in underwater acoustics. Here we analyze the characteristics of the self-interference based on the fieldwork, where self-interference measurements have been collected for multiple acoustic frequencies ranging from 20 to 180 kHz. The interference cancellation (IC) gain, as the performance metric of the digital self-interference suppression, is found to decrease when the acoustic carrier frequency increases. We propose to use the channel variation ratio (CVR) to characterize channel variability. Experimental results show that the CVR is larger at higher acoustic frequencies and high CVRs lead to the performance degradation in the self-interference suppression.

Usage of computers in medicine increases the accuracy and speeds up processes of data analysis and setting the diagnoses. Nowadays, numerous computer aided diagnostic systems exist and machine learning algorithms have significant role in them. Faster and more accurate systems are necessary. Common machine learning task that is part of computer aided diagnostic systems and different medical data analytic software packages is classification. In order to obtain better classification accuracy it is important to choose feature set and proper parameters for the classification model. Medical datasets often have large feature sets where many features are in correlation with others thus it is important to reduce the feature set. In this paper we propose adjusted brain storm optimization algorithm for feature selection in medical datasets. Classification was done by support vector machine where its parameters are optimized also by brain storm optimization algorithm.

While most state-of-the-arts adopt multi-scale or multi-column architectures to address such issue, they generally fail in modeling continuous scale variations since only discrete representative scales are considered. PGCNet, on the other hand, utilizes perspective information to guide the spatially variant smoothing of feature maps before feeding them to the successive convolutions. An effective perspective estimation branch is also introduced to PGCNet, which can be trained in either supervised setting or weakly-supervised setting when the branch has been pre-trained. Our PGCNet is single-column with moderate increase in computation, and extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets show the improvements of our method against the state-of-the-arts.

That is because most SLAM algorithms are feature-based techniques and often it is impossible to extract the matched features from blurry underwater images. To get more useful features, image processing techniques can be used to dehaze the images before they are used in a navigation/localization algorithm. There are many well-developed methods for image restoration, but the degree of enhancement and the resource cost of the methods are different. In this paper, we propose a new visual SLAM, specifically-designed for the underwater environment, using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the quality of underwater images with underwater image quality evaluation metrics. This procedure increases the efficiency of SLAM and gets a better navigation and localization accuracy.

The Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education has set 3 main standards in quality assurance, namely (1) education standards, (2) research standards, and (3) community service standards. Each is equipped with 8 sub-standards; so the minimum standard that must be applied is 24 standards. These three main standards are minimal academic standards so that each university must explore and guarantee academic and non-academic quality. A College must develop standards in IQAS that exceed the National Standards of Higher Education. Universities can develop the more distinctive or the broader the substance or content that is in the Vision of Higher Education, the more various types and number of Higher Education Standards. The more standards established and implemented indicate that the better the management system is carried out so that the Institution can be superior.

623,623,The recommendation service of the shareholding for fund companies based on improved collaborative filtering method," Published by Elsevier B.V.Through the effective processing of the financial dataset of listed companies and the improvement of the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm, this paper proposes a recommendation service which can predict the shareholding proportion of the listed companies more accurately in order to help fund companies to make reasonable decisions to invest listed companies. This service includes two important methods. To deal with the sparsity of data, one solution is to integrate similarity of user ratings and similarity of common-selected item to collaborative filtering algorithm. The relationship of common-selected item defined in this paper fully considers user's common scored items. The greater the relationship value between users is, more similar two users are. The other solution is mainly applicable to new companies with very few indicators. The approach proposed in this paper is mainly based on the similarity between items, and generates different filling value for each unrated item based on re-filling with item-based collaborative filtering algorithm. From the perspective of the recommendation method itself, the method proposed in this paper is superior to the traditional standard collaborative filtering algorithm and the SVD algorithm.",60025441,Nanjing Tech University,Nanjing,China,['1700'],23.25,0.17923484848484844,0.5029772727272727,0

However, currently such optical links are severely limited by the coverage range due to the high attenuation of light in the water environment as well as by the scattering problem. A new optical transceiver structure is proposed in this work to significantly extend the coverage range by several folds, targeting to solve this coverage bottleneck problem for high-speed data transfer. The proposal is a new optical transceiver structure with hybrid nonlinear pulse position modulation and time-frequency spreading. This new scheme is able to boost the range coverage by several folds, and was verified via thorough computer simulations using realistic models tailored for the optical channel propagation environments.

627,627,Real-time Human Corneal Images Processing Analysis of Placido Disk Corneal Topography Using Extenics," Published by Elsevier B.V.A sub-pixel image edge detection method based on polar coordinates is proposed in order to accurately detect images obtained from corneal topographic instrument based on Placido disk. The corneal image obtained by the corneal topographic instrument has the following characteristics: 1. Real time. The image acquisition video is set to 30 frames/sec, so the image processing algorithm should have the millisecond level of computing performance; 2. Quality is not stable. Because of the influence of photographing environment, machine and human entry factors, the images of cornea will have various kinds of noises. So we should propose a stable and effective preprocessing algorithm. 3. Image offset. Due to the operation characteristics of such corneal topographic system, the consecutive images' centers are unavoidable drifted during the process of image acquisition. So it is necessary to match the same serial target pictures. According to the above characteristics, based on the theory of extension and matter-element data structure, this paper efficiently structured captured images and uses two-dimensional Gaussian smoothing function to preprocess the data of all kinds of noises, including real human eyelashes removing and uses mixed Canbel (combining the canny and Sobel algorithms) and regional three-polynomial fitting method to effectively detect the sub-pixel edges of corneal images which we derive. Based on the experiments of standard simulation eye and real human eye, it is proved that the algorithm presented in this paper has good robustness and detection accuracy (the refractive error distributions of standard simulation eyes with different curvatures are less than 0.25D), which meets the operation requirements of actual systems used in industry. So our algorithm can be used in such corneal topographer in order to help detection of various eye diseases.",60026282,Zhejiang University of Technology,Hangzhou,China,['1700'],20.285714285714285,0.09711538461538462,0.35,0

631,631,Simulation of social capital dynamics: Impact of cultural events,"In the modern multicultural, globalizing, and simultaneously locally radicalizing world, evident limitations of understanding the cultural impact on even basic social capital processes open up a complex and challenging research frontier. Cultural policy experiments are time-consuming, too costly, and risky. Thus, there is a clear need to have feasible simulation models, which could help to foresee some consequences of social and cultural policies. However, there is a lack of available metrics, conceptual approaches, not to mention simulation models. In this paper, we present a scaled-down simulation of stylized cultural events' impact on social capital dynamics using NetLogo agent-based simulation model. The presented abstract model of social capital dynamics is based on well-known principles of Axelrod's model for culture dissemination, which we expanded for the agents' interaction not only in the physical space but also in the cultural features' space as well. Due to the added extensions, the presented simulation model is capable of simulating the impact of broadcasted cultural events. It is aimed to model not only neighborhood (pair-to-pair) interactions between simulated agents but also larger-scale social networking and mass media impact. Simulation results, among other things, reveal a plausible mechanism of culture impact to social capital, and cultural conditions for the emergence of various social cohesion states like globalization, polarization, or radicalization.",60059987,Vilniaus universitetas,Vilnius,Lithuania,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",23.666666666666668,0.07916666666666669,0.27555803571428567,1

In this paper, we consider the challenge of estimating a spatial field that represents underwater acoustic communication performance from a set of measurements. Kriging, which is widely used in geostatistics, has been previously used to estimate the communication performance at unknown locations, by performing spatial extrapolation. We compare kriging to cokriging where the latter is a bivariate estimation method. The methodology yields estimates of communication performance at desired locations based on measurements acquired at other locations. Moreover, a variance measure is provided that characterizes the uncertainty of the estimation. We present the structure of the proposed estimation technique and its computational complexity. We evaluate the efficacy of the technique by considering an approximate linear-log model of the communication performance, environmental noise, and a direct comparison of kriging and cokriging results.

644,644,A Classification Prediction Analysis of Flight Cancellation Based on Spark," Published by Elsevier B.V.Nowadays the phenomenon of flight delays and cancellations is becoming more and more serious. Flight delays and cancellations not only waste transportation resources, but also affect passengers' travel plans, which cause an increase in passenger discontent and complaint rates[2]. The passengers' dissatisfaction and distrust of airlines seriously damage the airlines' corporate reputation and then affect passengers' loyalty. Therefore, based on the information of 5 million flight data in the United States in 2016, we predicted the flight cancellations based on four classification algorithms: logistics regression, support vector machine (SVM), naive bayes and decision tree. We compared the training time of these algorithms by changing the number of nodes in the Spark cluster[9], and we also compared the classification accuracy, AUC (Area Under Curve) and PR(Precision-Recall). Experimental results show that: (1) When the number of nodes was 1, the average training time of these algorithms was 460 seconds. When the number of nodes was 3,5,7,9, the corresponding average training time were 207.25 seconds, 89.75 seconds, 44 seconds, 42 seconds, and when the number of nodes was 11, the average training time was 43.5 seconds; (2) Starting from 7 nodes, as the number of nodes increased while the decline rate of the average training time slowed down; (3) When the number of nodes was 1 and 3, the training time of naive bayes was the shortest, which were 386 seconds and 185 seconds respectively. When the number of nodes was 5,7,9 and11, the training time of SVM was the shortest, which were 72 seconds, 21seconds, 19 seconds and 18 seconds respectively; (4) the classification accuracy of SVM and decision tree was almost 90%, but naive bayes was just about 50.8% and logistics regression was only about 62.4%; (5) Both the AUC and PR of the decision tree algorithm were the highest: AUC was 0.558 and PR was 0.439. Therefore, the decision tree algorithm was the most suitable for predicting whether the flight would be cancelled or not, and there was a 90% probability that the prediction would be successful.",60013131,Central University of Finance and Economics,Beijing,China,['1700'],37.888888888888886,-0.008547008547008543,0.5450854700854701,0

648,648,Stacked-SVM: A dynamic SVM framework for telephone fraud identification from imbalanced cdrs,"Recent years witnesses the rampancy of telephone fraud along with the development of modern communication technology. The challenges from telephone fraud identification mainly exist in two aspects: (1) the telephone fraud records are typical imbalanced data due to the characteristic of heterogeneous spatial-temporal distribution, leading to bias towards predicting the majority class; (2) traditional evaluation metrics in imbalanced learning mainly rely on accuracy or precision, neglecting the completeness of telephone fraud identification in real-world implementations. In response to the limitations of traditional methods, we propose the Stacked-SVM framework based on heterogeneous ensemble learning and support vector machines (SVMs). We first employ both edited nearest neighbors (ENN) and adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) to alleviate the high dimensional curse in imbalanced data resampling; secondly, we propose the optimal linear combination strategy in the iteration of Stacked-SVM and demonstrate its validity with the help of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, we construct the Stacked-SVM framework with respect to the constraints of the loss function in SVM. We further compare the performance under different evaluation metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC value) with other four traditional telephone fraud identification methods, namely Logistic Regression, Isolation Forest, SVM with random parameter settings, and optimized SVM.

649,649,An efficient model for text sentiment analysis,"With the rapid development of text sentiment analysis, the demand for automatic classification of electronic documents has grown by leaps. In this paper, we propose a technique for text sentiment classification using term expression attention along with sentiment word embedding vector, which can represent both semantics and sentiment information. Firstly, the sentiment vector is constructed by Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) and attention mechanism. Then, it is combined with the semantics vector obtained by Word2Vec to form sentiment word vector. Meanwhile, we introduce the concept of expression attention, which is inspired by term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Finally, the sentiment of the text is classified by TextCNN, whose input is sentiment word vector. The model is evaluated by using small, widely used sentiment and subjectivity corpora. The results show that the proposed model out-performs several methods without sentiment vectors or using sentiment dictionaries to generate sentiment vectors.",60024059,Guangxi University for Nationalities,Nanning,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",18.125,-0.024999999999999998,0.4222222222222222,1
650,650,A comparison between Fuzzy Linguistic RFM Model and traditional RFM model applied to Campaign Management. Case study of retail business.," Published by Elsevier B.V.Recency Frequency Monetary Value (RFM) is a clear and descriptive way to classify a customer database based on purchasing behavior that direct marketers have used with success since almost the last twenty years. Despite the fashion that exists lately around predictive models and artificial intelligence, direct marketing's RFM, still has a place in modern database marketing. In a real business environment, RFM can still be useful when models are not practical because it is user friendly and the outcome is always interpretable. It can also be used to combine with other models. In this paper, we show a real example about how easy, accurate and explainable can be a customer segmentation based on the traditional RFM model and the 2-tuple RFM model applied to a customer database. It will help us to better understand the benefits of applying the 2-tuple model instead of the traditional one. We will be able to see how, by applying a k-means clustering on top of the 2-tuple model, segments have a great applicability from the business point of view. By using descriptive variables, we will clarify the cluster description and the model will provide us an extremely clear idea about how customers behave. The main goal for developing this example was to define the best target for a direct campaign communication.

651,651,Crowd counting with deep structured scale integration network,"Automatic estimation of the number of people in unconstrained crowded scenes is a challenging task and one major difficulty stems from the huge scale variation of people. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Structured Scale Integration Network (DSSINet) for crowd counting, which addresses the scale variation of people by using structured feature representation learning and hierarchically structured loss function optimization. Unlike conventional methods which directly fuse multiple features with weighted average or concatenation, we first introduce a Structured Feature Enhancement Module based on conditional random fields (CRFs) to refine multiscale features mutually with a message passing mechanism. Specifically, each scale-specific feature is considered as a continuous random variable and passes complementary information to refine the features at other scales. Second, we utilize a Dilated Multiscale Structural Similarity loss to enforce our DSSINet to learn the local correlation of people's scales within regions of various size, thus yielding high-quality density maps. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks well demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In particular, our DSSINet achieves improvements of 9.5% error reduction on Shanghaitech dataset and 24.9% on UCF-QNRF dataset against the state-of-the-art methods.",60025709,The University of Sydney,Sydney,Australia,"['1712', '1707']",26.714285714285715,0.03118386243386244,0.43511904761904757,1

In terms of the processing of financial public opinion, due to a wide variety of terminology in the financial sector and the suddenness of financial public opinion events as well as the proliferation of network vocabulary, a variety of unknown new words emerge while the traditional text classification method is basically incapable of processing these unrecognized characters. In this paper, an approach equipped with a new directional substitution model for processing the unknown words is proposed. Based on the semantic similarity of the context in word2ve algorithm, the model trains synonym substitution list and substitutes the unknown words in the original texts with synonyms. Also, the TFIDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) -weighted Naive Bayes classifier is used to carry out the text classification experiments on the traditional datasets and the synthetic datasets including the unknown words.

User self-reports have long been a traditional way for individual dietary assessment. However, the consumed weight or volume from individuals is highly dependent on their subjective judgment and may lead to biased dietary analysis results. Therefore, direct estimation of food volume tends to be a more appropriate way for self-dietary assessment. 3D measurement is an effective method for object volume estimation. At present, there are some good strategies based on 3D measurement for estimation of the object volume, such as virtual reality based method and convex hull-based method. However, due to complexity and diversity of the surface of food items, traditional methods for object volume estimation often fail to achieve good results in food volume estimation. Therefore, a slice-based method is proposed in this paper, which is a calculus-based strategy that obtains an estimation of food volume via segmentation and integration of point cloud.

675,675,Non-negative Matrix Factorization Based Learning from Label Proportions for Vehicle Loan Default Detection," Published by Elsevier B.V.In traditional supervised learning, the model is trained through a large number of known labels. In reality, the amount of data increases rapidly, and the cost of manual annotation is high. Besides, under the restriction of privacy protection, it is infeasible to obtain labels of a large number of samples. However, the proportion of samples in a certain class can be easily obtained. Thanks to label proportional learning, we can obtain the instance-level classifier merely based on the proportional information. In addition to this, label proportional learning with minor instance-level labeling can potentially improve the accuracy of the model. Hence, in this paper, we propose an improved model based on non-negative matrix factorization to solve semi-supervised label proportional learning, called semi-supervised proportion Matrix Factorization (SPMF). In order to effectively predict car default customers, our method leverage a small number of known labels and the remaining sample label proportional information to construct a classification model. In our experiment, customers defaults can be predicted and high prediction accuracy can be guaranteed.

In this paper, we re-examine this course for its offering during 2005-2017. The course has been developed around ontologies, and student projects have been a very important component in conducting the course. Although this course has made valuable contribution to our bioinformatics program, a lot of improvements can be made. A critical examination of our past experience suggests the need for emphasizing the importance of ""think big"" at big data era. In particular, it would be beneficial to incorporate blockchain technology to enrich the technical contents of this course.

How to improve the competitiveness of tourism has become a new idea for industrial upgrading in various regions. This paper builds an evaluation system consisting of five major aspects, based on the data of 75 tourist destinations; then, uses cluster analysis to classify cities, and uses logistic regression, SVM and random forest methods to predict the tourism competitiveness of sample cities and compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods - classification and regression. From the results of the empirical test, the results of the classification method are generally better than the results of the regression, and in the classification method, the results of the SVM are better than the results of the random forest.

The time series data in reality has complex characteristics, and the traditional single model has great limitations in prediction. For the problem that the time series data is too complicated, this paper proposes a time series mixed prediction model based on decomposition and synthesis. The time series is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). For the problem that the calculation complexity becomes larger after decomposition, and the prediction error of each sub-component leads to the total error is still large. In this paper, the sampled entropy (SE) method is used to combine the decomposed subsequences, which reduces the computational complexity and total error of the algorithm. The combined sequence is predicted by the LSTM neural network.

682,682,A Study on Mobile Customer Churn Based on Learning from Soft Label Proportions," Published by Elsevier B.V.In real-life scenarios, manual labeling is costly and inefficient. besides sometimes there is privacy restrictions on the user's information, which makes it difficult to detect customers losses in the mobile customer field. We cannot directly obtain information about a user is lost or not. However, the business manager can estimate the proportion of lost users based on his business experience. Besides, considering that the proportion information we obtain in reality is estimated and not completely accurate, we propose a soft label proportional learning method based on the learning from label proportions (LLP). In detail, we modify proportional loss term in the loss function by introducing a slack variable. In this way, the proportional loss within a certain range can be regarded as zero when the estimated proportional information is uncertain. The proportional information can be determined in a range by adjusting the parameter. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which provides a new way to effectively solve the problem of customer churn analysis in the field of mobile communication.",60020547,Texas A&amp;M University,College Station,United States,['1700'],19.666666666666668,0.06883116883116881,0.5761634199134199,0

685,685,3D Move to See: Multi-perspective visual servoing towards the next best view within unstructured and occluded environments,"In this paper we present a novel approach termed 3D Move to See (3DMTS) which is based on the principle of finding the next best view using a 3D camera array and a robotic manipulator to obtain multiple samples of the scene from different perspectives. Distinct from traditional visual servoing and next best view approaches, the proposed method uses simultaneously-captured multiple views, scene segmentation and an objective function applied to each perspective to estimate a gradient representing the direction of the next best view in a 'single shot'. The method is demonstrated within simulation and on a real robot containing a custom 3D camera array for the challenging scenario of robotic harvesting in a highly occluded and unstructured environment. We show, on a real robotic platform, that by moving the eye-in-hand camera using the gradient of an objective function leads to a locally optimal view of the object of interest, even amongst occlusions. The overall performance of the 3DMTS approach obtains a mean increase in target size of 29.3% compared to a baseline method using a single RGB-D camera, which obtained 9.17%. The results demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the 3DMTS method performed better in most scenarios, and yielded three times the target size compared to the baseline method. Increasing the target size in the image given occlusions can improve robotic systems detecting key object features for further manipulation tasks, such as grasping and harvesting.",60011019,Queensland University of Technology QUT,Brisbane,Australia,"['1712', '1707', '1706']",33.57142857142857,0.1329575892857143,0.30018973214285716,1
686,686,Using profiling to assemble an agile collaborative software development team made up of freelancers," Published by Elsevier B.V.Assembling software development freelancer comprised teams is a challenging task for a project manager. In an Agile environment, this is even more challenging because of the cross-functional character and multi-disciplinary requirements such methodology enforces. The project manager needs to identify individuals that are highly compatible from a collaborative point of view and have the skills to match project complexity. This is a lengthy endeavor which is prone to human bias as the collaborative nature of individuals that have never worked together is difficult to evaluate. The selection process also has considerable restrictions imposed by the sheer volume of information a human decision maker can process and analyze. Computerized data analysis, on the other hand, is free of bias and it can process large data sets very fast. For the current research process data was collected automatically from a freelance platform that allows free access to developers' profiles. The targeted platforms make information available about freelancer's skills, experience, background, and education. Data was validated, ensuring it's correct and relevant. Data was normalized to ensure it is easily quantifiable and can be measured using a common scale. Statistical methods were used to predict the data that was missing or incomplete. Based on the identified criteria a template was built to match the profile of the ideal team member. Machine learning techniques were used to group team members that would work together effectively from a collaborative point of view. An indicator was built to benchmark the team member's profile against the template and determine the highest ranking candidates. Conclusions were formulated regarding the topic of using profiling to assemble collaborative agile freelance software development teams.

687,687,Multi-perspective network representation based on human curation,"Network representation learning represents nodes in networks as low-dimension vectors which has been attracting increasing attention recently due to its effectiveness in network analysis tasks such as classification and link prediction. In this paper, our focus is on content curation social networks (CCSNs). There are more than one user relation subnetworks formed by different user relations in a social media network. However, most of existing representation learning algorithms usually study only one subnetwork which cannot study users from different views. On the other hand, most of the existing approaches are designed for universal networks which do not consider the unique characteristics of different networks. We propose a multi-perspective network representation based on human curation (MNHC) model, which aims to infer network representations across multiple relations in CCSNs. The network representation model utilizes the unique structure of networks and human curation signals in CCSNs which combines two user relation subnetworks and human curation signals for informative network representations.

692,692,Comparing four important sorting algorithms based on their time complexity,"Time complexity and memory complexity are significant for all algorithms, especially sorting algorithms. Using the right sorting algorithm for our data can possibly decrease time and memory usage. The sorting problem has attracted a great deal of attention because efficient sorting is essential to optimize other algorithms as well. Most of the time, a sorting algorithm consists of two nested loops, which can determine the complexity of the algorithm; however, other factors such as the number of data and data types play an important role as well. Thus, by using the right sorting algorithm, we can make more efficient use of time and memory. In this paper, we use different sorting algorithms for different data types in order to determine the optimum use of time and memory for these algorithms. It means that if we know what kind of dataset we have, it can help us to use a more efficient algorithm even close to linear time. One of the interesting results is shell sort. So, by checking each type of data, like primes, Fibonacci, odd, and even datasets, we can know more information about each sorting algorithm. Also, we can determine which algorithm needs additional memory for sorting and which does not. To reduce the time and memory allocation, we use various data, such as numbers in random order or reverse order, as well as a large number of data and a small number of data. By comparing the results, the optimal algorithm in various scenarios may be recognized.",60102242,"Islamic Azad University, Central Tehran Branch",Tehran,Iran,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",20.833333333333332,0.1849647266313933,0.5861111111111111,1

The acoustic scene is a mixture of background sounds and various sound events, and sound events often determine the type of acoustic scene. However, in many research methods for acoustic scene classification, only a few people have noticed the important information of sound events. In this paper, we combine the ASC task and Sound Event Detection (SED) task, and propose a new CNN approach with multi-task Learning (MTL), which uses SED as an auxiliary task to pay more attention to the information of the sound event in the model. Besides, in view of the characteristic of the sound event with high-energy time-frequency components, we use Global Max Pooling (GMP) instead of the Fully Connected layer (FC) in the traditional CNN. The advantage is that the model focused on distinct high-energy time-frequency components of audio signals (sound event). Finally, extensive experiments are carried out on the TUT acoustic scene 2017 dataset.

695,695,Classification conducting knowledge acquisition by an evolutionary robust GRBF-NN model," Published by Elsevier B.V.Diverse machine learning methods have been successfully used to discover classifying rule among classification data. Sometimes, executing a decision may however indirectly alter feature values of the classified objects, further influencing their classes under the discovered classifying rule. Actually, mining such classification conducting knowledge (CC-knowledge) hidden under the decision from related data can be very helpful to future decision-makings. Hence, this paper proposes an evolutionary robust GRBF-NN model to imitate the mathematical mapping between the feature values before and after executing the decision. A dual-loop nested robust training (DNRT) method is correspondingly developed to determine the weights and parameters using M-AdaBoost and NSGAII respectively in the inner and outer loop. Its remarkable merit is that it considers the classification information by integrating the given classifying rule into both training loops, ensuring the reasonability of prediction. In order to enhance the model's generalization, the outer loop defines a regularized term and regards it as another optimizing objective of NSGAII besides the training error.

699,699,Deep learning for light field saliency detection,"Recent research in 4D saliency detection is limited by the deficiency of a large-scale 4D light field dataset. To address this, we introduce a new dataset to assist the subsequent research in 4D light field saliency detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is to date the largest light field dataset in which the dataset provides 1465 all-focus images with human-labeled ground truth masks and the corresponding focal stacks for every light field image. To verify the effectiveness of the light field data, we first introduce a fusion framework which includes two CNN streams where the focal stacks and all-focus images serve as the input. The focal stack stream utilizes a recurrent attention mechanism to adaptively learn to integrate every slice in the focal stack, which benefits from the extracted features of the good slices. Then it is incorporated with the output map generated by the all-focus stream to make the saliency prediction. In addition, we introduce adversarial examples by adding noise intentionally into images to help train the deep network, which can improve the robustness of the proposed network. The noise is designed by users, which is imperceptible but can fool the CNNs to make the wrong prediction. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model on the popular evaluation metrics. The proposed method performs favorably compared with the existing 2D, 3D and 4D saliency detection methods on the proposed dataset and existing LFSD light field dataset.

The IoUT network and application semantics are aligned with the data-centric communication model of NDN, which enables operators to deploy and configure networks more easily, and developers to focus more on ""things"" and data. The paper starts from introducing new challenges in IoUT and then illustrating in detail with simple examples to show how to employ NDN architecture to IoUT and how to enable additional functionalities required by IoUT.",60028458,City College of New York,New York,United States,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",34.8,0.1551373106060606,0.5043763528138527,1

Aiming at this problem, a new word discovery algorithm based on the principle of similarity judgment is proposed. The principle of similarity judgment is that if the context of a candidate substring is similar to the context of another expression, the probability of it becoming a new word will increase. The new algorithm is based on the unsupervised new word discovery algorithm filtered by statistical information such as mutual information, information entropy, and word frequency. The similarity and mutual information are combined into similarity enhancement mutual information, which is used as an indicator to measure internal integration. Finally, experiments show that the algorithm of similarity enhancement mutual information can effectively identify new words in the industry with high precision.",60022381,Beijing Jiaotong University,Beijing,China,"['1712', '1709', '1707', '1705']",23.833333333333332,0.1415340909090909,0.46698863636363636,1

705,705,Evolutionary netarchitecture search for deep neural networks pruning,"Network pruning is an architecture search process to determine the state (remove/remain) of neurons in the network. It is a com-binatorial optimization problem, and this combinatorial optimiza-tion problem is NP-hard. Most existing pruning methods prune channels/neurons based on the assumption that they are indepen-dent in network. However, there exists dependency among chan-nels/neurons. We try to solve the combinatorial optimization problem by evolutionary algorithm (EA). However, the traditional EA can't be used directly into deep neural networks (DNNs) because the problem dimension is too high. Attention mechanism (AM) can help us get parameter important score to reduce prob-lem difficulty, making the architecture search process more effective. Therefore, combining EA and AM, we propose an Evolutionary NetArchitecture Search (EvoNAS) method to solve network pruning problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on common datasets with ResNet, ResNeXt, and VGG. For example, for ResNet on CIFAR-10, EvoNAS reduces 73.40% computing operations and 73.95% parameters with 0.13% test accuracy increasement.

Compared with the traditional deblurring algorithm, this method eliminates the process of blur kernel estimation, directly restores the motion blurred image. Gradient L1 regularization is added on the basis of the traditional GAN, which enhances the edge features of the restored image and adds the perceptual loss term, so that the image generated by the generator is closer to the global structure of the target clear image.

In the paper, we propose the multiway attention neural machine translation model (MA-NMT) which employs multiple attention functions in the attention mechanism to calculate the weight of each source word when predicting the next target word. Specially, we design three attention functions to get the contextual information. Then we combine the features from all attention function to obtain the final semantic representation.

Our proposed loss disentanglement has the twofold advantage of simplifying the training dynamics in the presence of losses with complex interactions of parameters, and sidestepping the issue of balancing independent regression terms. Our solution overcomes these issues by isolating the contribution made by groups of parameters to a given loss, without changing its nature. We further apply loss disentanglement to another novel, signed Intersection-over-Union criterion-driven loss for improving 2D detection results. Besides our methodological innovations, we critically review the AP metric used in KITTI3D, which emerged as the most important dataset for comparing 3D detection results. We identify and resolve a flaw in the 11-point interpolated AP metric, affecting all previously published detection results and particularly biases the results of monocular 3D detection.

Recently, local patch descriptors via deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with a triplet loss have achieved a promising performance. In this paper, we propose a brand new quadruplet loss, which achieves higher accuracy than other pairwise loss and triplet loss methods. Our loss is inspired by a uniform distribution. It separates non-matching examples by means of hard sampled non-matching pairs in a batch, meanwhile uses the random sampled non-matching examples to keep non-matching pairs satisfying a uniform distribution. By applying the proposed quadruplet loss to the L2Net CNN architecture leads to a more compact descriptor named QuadrupletNet.

717,717,Nomadic path optimizing model under multi-factor constraints," Published by Elsevier B.V.Nomadism is one of the traditional lifestyles in grassland. However, the current situation of pasture ecological environment is too vulnerable to support long-term and durative grazing. With the sustainable growth of population and livestock numbers, herdsmen utilize pasture resources irrationally, which leads to pasture deterioration. The factors affecting nomadic path include the objective factors during the grazing process, the herdsmen's subjective preference and the reasonable restriction of rangeland carrying capacity. The equitable path planning combing multiple factors can improve the efficiency of forage resources utilization. Firstly, a nomadic path network is constructed considering pasture seasonality. Secondly, in order to calculate the comprehensive values of the grazing trail between pastures in the nomadic path network, a grazing trail hierarchy model is established according to the different demands of herdsmen, such as livestock migration distance, transition time and transfer cost. Thirdly, by using the improved KSP algorithm, which can sort the grazing trail values, the optional paths are designed sequentially. Fourthly, the limitation of rangeland carrying capacity is added to the nomadic path optimizing model, the recommended path for herdsmen is the shortest one which meets the carrying capacity constraints. Finally, the proposed model in this paper is verified via an example. Through optimizing the nomadic path scheme, this paper can provide the decision support for herdsmen, and brings actual application value.",60023133,Qinghai University,Xining,China,['1700'],20.363636363636363,0.023333333333333334,0.3655555555555556,0
